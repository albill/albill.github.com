I have become the empty box bunny. My group at work moved to a new building a week ago and I just realized that if you remove the eight days that I am gone on vacation, I am moving in four or so days to my new house with R. Since my apartment is not completely packed, this is a bit of concern. ;-)

So now I steal the empty boxes from my coworkers offices as the unpack and either use them or give them to R. I haven't bought a moving box since I started working at Microsoft five years ago. I just slink in and grab. "Are you done with that?"

Yesterday was lodge day for my Aurum Solis (sort of) group. We actually had a pretty good meeting and went over a bunch of tarot work that we are doing. I'm now looking at traveling with the group in late September to visit our mother body in Minnesota, which should be fairly interesting. They are a good group of people there.

Other than that, it's back to the daily grind until I leave for California Thursday morning.
