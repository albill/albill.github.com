The <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Main_Page">24th Chaos Communication Congress</a> (24C3) in Germany has been over for a couple of days now. This is an annual event (the 24th, strangely) organized by the <a href="http://www.ccc.de/">Chaos Computer Club</a>. As their site states:
<blockquote>The Congress offers lectures and workshops on a multitude of topics and attracts a diverse audience of thousands of hackers, scientists, artists, and utopians from all around the world. The 24C3s slogan is Volldampf voraus! – the German equivalent of “full steam ahead” – a particular request for talks and projects featuring forward looking hands-on topics. </blockquote> 
I've been meaning to go to this event and did consider going to it this year but it is a very long way away and I did just go to Japan for vacation a few months ago. The intersection of hacker culture, artists, and freaks is always an interesting convergence of disparate groups. 

You can see the list of <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Workshops">workshops</a> or the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Fahrplan/">daily schedule</a> if you want to see more about what went on there.

Luckily, for those of us who were unable or unwilling to go, many of the presentations at 24C3 were recorded and these are now available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/de/">Creative Commons license</a>. There are a lot of options for video here.

There is a general <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Conference_Recordings">recordings page</a> up which gives links to video recordings in a variety of formats. The <a href="http://chaosradio.ccc.de/24c3_m4v.html">main download page</a> also has an <a href="http://chaosradio.ccc.de/24c3_m4v-all.rss">rss link</a> to the video files (for feed readers) and an <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=271251344">iTunes link</a> is also available. Given the size of these files, I do suggest using the <a href="http://outpost.h3q.com/fnord/24c3-torrents/">torrent links</a> for them instead of getting them directly via http or ftp. 

In addition to all of this, there is also <a href="http://24c3.ccctube.de">CCC Tube</a>, which allows you to stream the content in a Flash-based player. This is my favorite way of viewing talks out of the choices though all of the talks are not up yet.

Content from last year (23C3) is also <a href="http://chaosradio.ccc.de/23c3_m4v.html">available</a> as well (with another page <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006-static/static/s/t/r/Streams.html">here</a>). I have watched many of these and, while quality varies, they are quite interesting.
