This last summer, I was exposed to Ganesh or Ganapati in a Tibetan
Buddhist context. Up to this point, I'd only been familiar with him from
the Hindu context:

I'd always been fond of Ganesh as an opener of ways, a clearer of
obstacles. I am friends with a number of Shaivite Tantrikas and they are
all quite fond of him. Whether I could be considered a strict Buddhist
Tantric practitioner is pretty open to questions on most days. Ganesh
was once the primary deity of some tantric sects, as Mike Magee mentions
[here](http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/gthursby/tantra/ganesh.htm):

> Until the middle ages c.e., it appears that there was a separate cult
> of tantriks, the Ganapatyas, who followed this Deva and his Shakti.
> Like Shiva, he was worshipped via a linga, but in this case red.

Mike also quotes Arthur Avalon on Mahaganapati:

> "...he is to be meditated upon as seated on a lotus consisting of the
> letters of the alphabet. The sadhaka should meditate upon an island
> composed of nine gems, placed in an ocean of sugarcane juice; a soft
> gentle breeze blows over the island and makes the waves wash the shore
> thereof. The place is a forest of Mandara, Parijata and other Kalpa
> trees and creepers, and the light from the gems thereon casts a red
> glow on the ground. The six gladdening seasons are always there. The
> sun and moon brighten up the place. In the middle of the island is a
> Parijata tree whereon are the nine gems and beneath it is the great
> Pitha (altar) on which is the lotus whereon is seated Mahaganapati.
> His face is that of the great elephant with the moon on it. He is red
> and has three eyes. He is held in loving embrace by his beloved who is
> seated in his lap and has a lotus in her hand. In each of his ten
> hands he is holding a pomegranate, a mace, a bow, a trident, a discus,
> a lotus, a noose, a red water-lily, a sheaf of paddy and his own tusk.
> He is holding a jewelled jar in his trunk. By the flapping of his
> ears, he is driving away the bees attracted to his temples by the
> fluid exuding therefrom, and he is scattering gems from out of the jar
> held in his trunk. He is wearing a ruby-studded crown and is adorned
> with gem." *Sharadatilakatantra*, Agamanusandhana Samiti, 1933.

This last summer, at retreat, I found out that Ganesh, like many Hindu
gods, had been taken up by the tantric Buddhist practitioners long ago.
Recently, I found images of a Tibetan Buddhist thangka to him, showing
him in a very Tibetan style:

In any case, I found this pretty interesting though not for any easy to
explain reason.
