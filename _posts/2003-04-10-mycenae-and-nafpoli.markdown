We left the armpit of Corinth this morning without even getting
breakfast. Unlike every other Greek city that we've been in, there is
almost no convenient food in Corinth. Feh on them. We drove down to
Mycenae on the way to Nafpoli. Whew. That one's almost as much of a
climb as Delphi was. It's on top of a large mass of rock, very
defensible, and the ruins are in fairly good shape. This means that
there are actual low walls in places along with flooring and not just a
few lines on the ground! ;-) The view was impressive as was the overall
site. Some of the grave areas are quite different than anything else
we've seen so far in Greece. One section is in a ring around a pit area.
The ring is constructed of a double wall of thin stone (five inches or
so) with a three foot or so wide space in between the two walls. This
goes around the pit. We visited the "Treasury of Atreus" as well. That
is one of the oldest extant tombs in Greece per my understanding. From
the outside, it looks a lot like the popular conception of a barrow
mound with a opening tunnel into the side of the hill. The tunnel
entrance is quite high (20 feet or so) and has a non-arch above it. It's
a bit like a triangle and dates before the mastery of arches. Inside, it
is a huge domed vault. I'm guessing but it was sixty feet or more to the
peak inside. This is all within the hill and the stonework is all quite
intact. It did smell a bit musty though... There is a second room of
some sort but is was closed off with a "Danger" sign so I took a flash
photo of the darkness. We'll see if I get anything there. We then drove
down to Nafpoli, which is a nice little town about 12 kilometers past
Argos ("Oldest town in Greece!"). The town was the original capital of
Greece as a modern state and seems very Venetian in the older areas. We
had a hard time finding a hotel as everything seemed to be full.
Eventually, we found a place for the two nights that we'll be here and
got some lunch. Tomorrow, we will be going out to Epidaurus, home of the
Asclepius Cult.
