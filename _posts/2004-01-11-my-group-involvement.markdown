just posted about her group involvement and I realized that I'd left out the local Tibetan Buddhist group, Pema Kilaya (<a href="http://www.pemakilaya.org">http://www.pemakilaya.org</a>).

That brings the total to:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Pema Kilaya</strong> - Local orthodox Nyingma lineage Tibetan Buddhist group. The group just recently acquired a permanent space at the big Baptist Church on Capitol Hill so we're setting up a full temple there. This is an on and off commitment because there isn't a regular cycle of activities with this group right now. With the new space, we should be building up to it though.</li>
	<li><strong>The Citadel of the Ouroboros</strong> - My longest lasting commitment. We meet a few times a month and at other odd times to do regular ritual work on Ogdoadic lines and to continue to pursue the training relating to our initiation. This is my main ritual focus most of the time.</li>
	<li><strong>Ordo Templi Orientis</strong> - Not always a month to month commitment but I do like to go to Gnostic Mass when I can, attend the appropriate initiation ceremonies for community members and be somewhat involved. I have an outstanding degree that I can apply for when I decide it is time to do so as well.</li>
	<li><strong>Dzogchen Community</strong> - There is a local branch of Namkhai Norbus' <em>Dzogchen Community</em> here in Seattle. It isn't super active most of the time but they generally do a ganapuja on the full moons (as measured on the Tibetan Calendar) and I want to make a regular presence there. On a personal level, I'm trying to integrate the medium Tun ritual, which is basic Dzogchen ritual work, into my regular practice.</li>
	<li><strong>Unnamed Wiccan Training Group</strong> - This is what I speak about above. No details about this yet but I expect that it will meet a couple of times a month (perhaps even weekly, I don't know) and will also involve a bit of work outside of meetings.</li>
	<li><strong>Queen Anne Masonic Temple</strong> - Assuming my application is accepted and I am initiated, I know that QAMT meets on at least once a month and I would want to make a regular presence there as I study the masonic material.</li>
	<li><strong>McNeil Island Wiccan Ministry</strong> -  and I are going out once a month for a study group or class with the inmates at this facility with the occasional celebrations of Sabbats and the annual feast. This is an ongoing commitment and I'd like to make sure that we provide the guys with the best possible help.</li>
	<li><strong>Seattle Salon</strong> - This is the proposed discussion group on magical topics that  and I have begun organizing. This doesn't meet yet but there will be a monthly discussion going here.</li>
</ul>
