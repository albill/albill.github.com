<b>Snowbirds go where angels fear to tread</b>

Out in the Mojave desert, American fugitives from family or the law have camped out for 40 years in Mad Max-style Slab City. But as DOUG SAUNDERS discovers, they've been joined by some unlikely neighbours -- sun-seeking Canadians, who have brought along a little peace, order and good . . . well, not government

NILAND, CALIFORNIA -- The last sort of person you'd expect to meet in this sun-blasted expanse of rusting heaps, leather-skinned loners, Mad Max solar contraptions and endless dust storms would be Valerie Molenkamp, a polite and witty grandmother from Vancouver Island in tennis shoes and pressed white blouse.

But here she is, sharing jokes with a circle of bedraggled mountain men whose dirt-soiled T-shirts and free-range facial hair testify to their determined refuge from human civilization, or at least from the obligations of family life. Ms. Molenkamp, poking her head under the awning that covers the assemblage of derelict buses known as the Oasis Club, exchanges gossip in the sort of refined diction that would not be out of place on CBC Radio 2.

"It doesn't look like much, the Oasis Club, but they do at least provide some hot meals," she says. "And most of these men are very much in need of them."

Unlike many others, she has not come here out of downward mobility or a need to lie low until the heat blows over. In a few weeks, she will head up to a tony Palm Springs park costing $600 a month. But she has come here for four years seeking the things a 60-plus widow lacks -- companionship, adventure, men. Strolling across the patch of gravel and dust outside, she laughs at her preposterous situation.

"My sister is very disapproving of my visits to the Slabs. She says, 'I can't see what you see in this place.' I tell her it's the people. It's like a big family. There is a surprising sense of camaraderie."

Like hundreds of other comparatively well-heeled older Canadians, Ms. Molenkamp has run away and joined Slab City, one of North America's most well-established communities of utter lawlessness.

The Canadians play a peculiar role here: At first blush, they could be mistaken for garden-variety snowbirds, itinerant seniors with a taste for bingo games in RV parks. But beneath the silver locks, they are a particularly strange and exotic breed of snowbird, and that blend of surface conventionality and deeper anarchy has been the secret that has kept Slab City functioning, without visible means of support, for more than four decades.

Ms. Molenkamp is a perfect example: Despite her sister's admonitions and the fearful warnings of other relatives, she is not simply slumming here. Amid this expanse of human and mechanical wreckage, she has found love, and death, and love again.

Sixty years ago, Slab City was known to the world as the Camp Dunlap Marine Training Facility, a suitably remote place in the middle of the Mojave desert for General Patton's tank crews to learn the ropes of desert warfare. In 1946, the military moved out, and the nearby town of Niland reclaimed the barracks' wood and metal, leaving only the hundreds of concrete slabs that formed their foundations.

Sometime around 1961, people began to notice that this 640-acre parcel of land fell under the jurisdiction of nobody in particular, mostly because nobody wanted it. Unlike other such desert netherlands, this one was fairly close to a road and a poky little town, and its concrete slabs were handy for parking old buses, campers and jalopies. Within a few years, its winter population had expanded to 5,000, though only a couple hundred truly desperate individuals stick around through the 40-degree summer.

Slab City lacks most of the necessities of life, including running water, sewage, electricity, mail service, telephone lines, grocery stores or hospitals -- the latter a fairly serious problem since almost the entire population is over 55 years old, with a good number over 80.

But it also lacks other things -- rules, supervisors, curfews, family values, schedules, neighbours, taxes, rents, fees, police, bailiffs, nagging spouses. This holds great appeal to a number of people who have slaved their whole lives under boring jobs and stultifying families, their sanity maintained only by dreams of wide-open spaces and complete freedom. We may see barren emptiness, but they see clear air free of responsibility.

A great many of these people are men.

"A lot of people here are running away from something," Ms. Molenkamp says with a wry smile. "Like child support, usually."

If the Slabs were 30 years younger, they might call their community an anarchist collective, or an intentional community, or a temporary autonomous zone, or a squat. Indeed, some Californians have tried to liken it to Burning Man, the annual gathering of young artists and stoners in another part of the desert. But those people are trying to create something. The Slabs are trying to get away from something.

And yet they've created something all the same. They have managed to forge a remarkably resilient, if messy and crisis-ridden social structure -- one that seems to endure endless mental and physical health problems, a high mortality rate and almost no birth rate, and the disappearance of most of the population every summer --through co-operation and necessity and good old truck-and-barter.

There are people with tanker trucks selling water, "honey wagons" draining sewage tanks, people hawking propane and a Mexican guy who comes by once a week touting fresh fruit. There is quite a good library, set up by a long-term resident who died last year and stocked with hundreds of donated books. There is a barbershop and two churches, at least three nightclubs and a hugely successful company that does solar-power conversions for as little as $700. There is daily news, delivered on CB radio, as well as regular parades and ballroom dances under the purple night sky, and there is an Avon lady.

In the place of a class system, Slab City is geographically divided, into perhaps a dozen neighbourhoods, by degrees of disengagement from broader society.

Of course, money has something to do with this: Housing facilities range from $300,000 mobile homes, with video cameras in place of rear-view mirrors, to heaps of trash and wreckage that would not be out of place in Calcutta.

On one extreme is the Badlands, a distant neighbourhood in which a couple of hundred frightening people live year-round in collapsing trailers surrounded by barbed wire, piles of rotting garbage, smashed up automotive wreckage and spray-painted warning signs. This is a destitute place of addiction, petty crime, mental breakdown and terrible poverty. The few children here are truly depressing cases, though they are bused to the nearest school.

Its residents are often legendary: The Snake Man raises rattlesnakes, fires rifles at will and relishes his role as one of the city's more unhinged individuals. (There are a number of pretenders to this title.) In one corner of the Badlands you'll find something calling itself Skin City RV, with a spray-painted sign announcing "Private Nude Camping," though the jagged scrap-metal surroundings and the prospect of severe sunburn seem to have deterred any visitors.

The Canadians occupy a unique place in this structure. Several hundred of them spend their winters in a relatively well-kept neighbourhood over by the canal that has recently come to be known as Loonie Hill, although there is nothing resembling a hill here.

I dropped by Loonie Hill one morning and found a group of Canadians sitting on lawn chairs playing cards and gabbing -- a sight that would be familiar in any RV park, were it not for the vacant expanse of the bombing range stretching to the horizon behind them. Their trailers, equipped with satellite TV dishes and generators and solar panels and maple-leaf flags, were parked in a circle around a sage shrub, and little wrens pecked for crumbs in the dust as they described the strange draw of Slab City.

"We come here because we like the sun and open spaces," says Jill Lang from Rondel, Alta. Her husband Tom added: "We like that we don't have to follow all those rules and have people on all sides of us. And we feel safe here. There's hardly any crime, because people watch out for each other. We haven't met any nasty people yet."

Lynn Mulder, from Red Deer, Alta., says that the apparent lack of recreation is deceptive: "There's good walking. The fighter jets are exciting. And the sunsets are great."

She looks around. "But, really, I don't know what people would do here for six months." Like many of the Canadians, she drops by for a few weeks every winter, until the bracing sense of freedom is overtaken by the dank air of boredom.

Most of these folks could pass for the retired Canadians you'd find in the RV parks of Florida or Texas every winter. But if you grab a seat and talk for a while -- which would be hard to avoid -- you'll realize that there is something slightly different about them.

Wayne Tilley was born in 100 Mile House, B.C., spent a tough childhood on Toronto's Parliament Street, served in the Armed Forces and now summers in Barrie, Ont. with his wife Lillian. He spends the whole winter here. You get the sense, hanging out with Wayne and his congenial circle of tough-guy friends, that they have wanted to be outlaws all their lives.

"Freedom, that's what it is. You go to an RV park, and they tell you what to eat and where to park. It's like being in the Forces again. Here we can move around, we can set up how we like, we can pick up the spaces we want. When you get an RV, you think you're going to have a life of freedom on the road, but you learn quick. You think there are a lot of places like this? Well, there aren't. This is it."

Valerie Molenkamp does not choose to set her wheels down in Loonie Hill. As a woman travelling alone, she prefers the well-kept neighbourhoods near the centre of the old tank base, where the single RVers gather in huge packs.

The meaning of the word "single" has several meanings here, few of which would be familiar in the bars of Vancouver or Toronto. One expansive neighbourhood is run by the Slab Lows, a branch of the Loners on Wheels organization. The Lows organize a busy schedule of social events, but they are decidedly not a dating organization -- their credo prevents most forms of hitching up, on the principle that the single life is a virtue in itself.

Slab Singles is an even larger neighbourhood of long, straight streets and creosote bushes. These people, mostly men of a decidedly weather-beaten cast, are here to find companionship -- though they usually just find each other, over a beer and a bowl of chili at the Oasis Club. These guys are very much in search of women, though their desires are less sexual than practical -- most of them are over 65, and few have lived on their own.

Ms. Molenkamp fell into the middle of this scene four years ago. She and her husband had travelled North America in their RV for years before he died a decade ago. After a period of depression, she pulled herself together and fired up the RV on her own.

On her travels through the deserts and beaches and outlet-mall towns of the U.S., she began to hear about the Slabs. Out of curiosity she came, and she fell in love.

"I came here to find some peace, and meet some interesting people," she says, and chuckles. "What happened was I met a man, and I married him."

He was an engineer, who had made quite a lot of money rather quickly and then squandered it away even more quickly, by gambling and making unwise purchases. He had alienated his family and moved off to join the Slabs. He was looking for someone like Valerie. She knew how to handle guys like him. They planned to travel.

She shrugs and shakes her head. "Unfortunately, he died three months later."

He had been ill, and quickly deteriorated. She is stoic -- there are a lot of people here who are worse off. Perhaps a dozen Slabs die here every year. The city's bulletin board, out by the CB-radio station and the solar-power shop, is covered in notices testifying to this isolation: "Would Mr. Deck please phone his nephew, George, who lives in Florida, immediately."

There is a sense, among the veteran Slabs, that success has ruined this place. Its reputation has made it a magnet for the lonely, including many whose loneliness stems from problems far deeper than mere eccentricity or bullheadedness.

"This used to be a nice town, where people took care of each other," says Mike Gohl, known throughout Slab City as Solar Mike. He came here in 1986, looking for ways to live closer to nature, and set up shop in what was then the novel business of solar electricity.

Now, thanks to tax rebates offered by the California government and the distinct lack of any overhead costs, he is able to provide solar-power installations on RVs for prices much lower than anywhere else. A lot of people come to Slab City just for his work.

But he believes the city's glory days are over. A couple years ago, the state began trying to get Slab City shut down (the land is owned by the California teachers' pension fund, though there is no chance it will ever be developed, given its remote and hostile location).

Its reputation as a refuge for outlaws and deadbeats began to overtake its role as an oasis for free-spirited snowbirds.

"Because people only heard the bad things, and heard about a few really rotten characters, this place started to attract a lot more bad people," he says. "Every year, we get fewer people."

The Canadians keep coming, though. In Solar Mike's view, it is their sense of peace, order and good parking, rather than the sheet-metal flamboyance of the more colourful and publicity-grabbing Slabs, that has kept the government of California from shutting this place down and sending everyone down the road. The crazies get their pass because of quieter dreamers like Valerie Molenkamp, who see a chance to make a second beginning, or a third or fourth or fifth, out here in the desert.

She laughs. "My niece said to me the other day, 'Do you think if I send my mom there, you can find her a man?' "

She probably could. After checking up on the deep-browned guys at the Oasis Club and chatting with me, she strolls out to the old tank road and gets in a car driven by another hardy old Slab, her new boyfriend. She waves, and disappears in the distance behind a cloud of dust.
