I'm sitting here about to go to bed and writing an e-mail and the house does this little creak and twitch. The bookcase next to me makes a little sound.

What's that mean? Oh, it must be time for our weekly quake.

So I immediately go over to the hand <a href="http://quake.usgs.gov/recenteqs/Maps/122-38.html">earthquake map</a> (yes, I have it bookmarked) and check.

<a href="http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/recenteqs/Quakes/nc40200362.html">Here it is</a>. Just a little 3.3.

If I hadn't been sitting in front of my computer at night, when the house is quiet and people (and cats) sleeping, I would never have noticed. This is probably the weirdest thing about living down in California.
