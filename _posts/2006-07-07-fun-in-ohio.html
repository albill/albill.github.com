I am in Cincinnati, Ohio right now staying with my friend, Jim, who does the 'The Path of the Mahayana' podcast.

We have been doing some Buddhist training that involves us getting up at 2:00 AM and going all day. I only had about four hours sleep before I came here and have probably gotte two and a half since I arrived. If I'm lucky, I'll get four hours tonight before we get up early again. Since Ohio is three hours ahead of the west coast, two in the morning is only 11:00 PM back home. Needless to say, my body is a bit confused right now.

Tomorrow, we will do the Jukai ceremony and I will receive the first five precepts that I have written about before. I will be back late Sunday night to Oakland.
