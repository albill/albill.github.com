Brandon Sanderson is a fantasy writer who lives Provo, Utah and teaches
at Brigham Young University (BYU). He is the author of several novels
including
"**[Elantris](http://www.amazon.com/Elantris-Brandon-Sanderson/dp/0765350378/)**"
and "**[The Final
Empire](http://www.amazon.com/Final-Empire-Mistborn-Book/dp/0765350386)**".
The latter is part of the "Mistborn" trilogy that he's writing and which
is two thirds published at this point. I read **Elantris** when it came
out on the recommendation of my friend, Duane, at the University of
Washington Bookstore. (Duane, by the way, is the primary reason why the
UW Bookstore has such a good science fiction section and why no
specialty bookstore for such has taken hold in Seattle). I read **The
Final Empire** earlier this week and have its sequel, **The Well of
Ascension**, sitting next to me. Brandon writes what would be considered
"Low Fantasy" by some measures in that his characters live in nastier,
shades of grey worlds where the good aren't always truly heroic and the
evil aren't utterly irredeemable or without motivation. I especially
appreciated this with one of his main "villians" in **Elantris**. I also
appreciate that Sanderson is one of the rare breed of thoughtful, yet
religious, fantasy writers, as his
[discussion](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/article/52/EUOLogy-On-Pullman-and-Censorship)
of Philip Pullman's **Dark Materials** trilogy and why encouraging
censorship is wrong-headed amongst religious people and an affront to
the quest for Truth (as also [quoted](http://scalzi.com/whatever/?p=183)
by John Scalzi as well). Sanderson has been working on a new novel,
"[**Warbreaker**](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/book/Warbreaker/)", to
be published after his Mistborn trilogy of books, probably in 2009. He
worked out a deal with his publisher, Tor, to offer the various drafts
of his novel for download under a Creative Commons license. As the book
goes from the early stages through to the final hardcover release,
Sanderson will be making the drafts available. On the page for
[**Warbreaker**](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/book/Warbreaker/), he
cites Cory Doctorow and his release of his work for download as part of
the impetus for his thinking. Sanderson states:

> ...Readers can ALREADY get their books for free; I went to the library
> often myself as a youth. And yet, I still bought books. I often bought
> the very books I'd checked out from the library, as I liked them so
> much I wanted to read them again and loan them out to others. What do

> they share my books without any direct profit to me? Or, would I

> realize that something Cory says is very true--my biggest challenge as

> people read them, they will want to read and buy more of them. I
> believe that readers like to own books and, yes, even like to buy them
> specifically to support authors they want to write more books. And so,
> I did something crazy. I went to Tor and asked if they'd be okay with
> me posting the entire version of Warbreaker AS I WROTE IT. Meaning,
> rough drafts. The early, early stuff which is filled with problems and
> errors. They thought I was crazy too (my agent STILL thinks this

> wanted to do something that would involve and reward my readers. For
> those who are aspiring novelists, I wanted to show an early version of
> my work so they could follow its editing and progress. For those who
> are looking to try out my novels, I wanted to offer a free download.

The downloads are available

I haven't looked at any of the drafts yet but I plan to do so. I've
enjoyed Sanderson's work so far, finding him to be an excellent
novelist, and I applaud his bold move in making these drafts of his new
novel available as he goes. This is interesting in that it is both
another writer offering his work for free in hopes of creating attention
and readership but also because you can observe the development of his
book from rough to final draft as he works on it over time. For those
interested in the craft of writing, that is likely to be interesting as
well.
