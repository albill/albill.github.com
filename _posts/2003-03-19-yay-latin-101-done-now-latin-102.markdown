Latin 101 is over. In the last six months, I've now taken Latin 101 and Ancient Greek 101. Not too bad for a guy who is a test lead during the day. I'm all signed up for Latin 102 next term!

I like Latin. It's cool. It's a lot more actual fun than Greek. Greek was <em>interesting</em> (and still is) but it was never actually <strong>fun.</strong>.

Now I can make myself a cool Golden Dawn style motto...lessee...<strong>Mea Mentula Vita Magni Dei</strong>... Perhaps not! :-O

Now I just have to spend the next two weeks of my "break" studying since I'll be in Greece for the first two weeks of the class.
