<strong>The Horror in the Theater: an H.P. Lovecraft Triptych of Terror</strong>

Written by Lyam White, Ron Sandahl, H.P. Lovecraft

Running Dates:

Description:
Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn indeed!

Oh, those pesky Deep Ones! Three OCT company members will adapt three of H.P. Lovecraftâ€™s tales of horror for the stage, where three separate directors will interpret them using one unified cast. The soul-shattering terror of the evening is guaranteed to make all who attend question their sanity and the very boundaries of reality itself!

And did I mention that there would be puppets?
