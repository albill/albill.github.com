**The Horror in the Theater: an H.P. Lovecraft Triptych of Terror**
Directed by Sean McEnaney, Rob D'Arc & Matt Fontaine Written by Lyam
White, Ron Sandahl, H.P. Lovecraft Running Dates: Oct. 3, 2003 - Nov. 8,
2003 Description: Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn indeed! Oh, those pesky Deep
Ones! Three OCT company members will adapt three of H.P. Lovecraftâ€™s
tales of horror for the stage, where three separate directors will
interpret them using one unified cast. The soul-shattering terror of the
evening is guaranteed to make all who attend question their sanity and
the very boundaries of reality itself! And did I mention that there
would be puppets?
