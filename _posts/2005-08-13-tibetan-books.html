From BoingBoing Blog:

The light of the disk is endless.

Tibetan monks wax poetic about computers. Boing Boing reader Ben Vershbow says,  "Kim White, my colleague at the Institute for the Future of the Book in New York, recently attended the <em>Changing Book</em> conference at the University of Iowa. There, she saw a spellbinding presentation by Jim Canary, Head Conservator at Indiana University's Lilly Library, on Tibetan book craft and current preservation and archiving efforts being carried out in collaboration with local monks. Kim describes the presentation and quotes from a poem written by one of the monks in praise of computers:"
<blockquote>"Some monks are now working on laptops, transcribing text and burning DVDs. Here is an excerpt from a poem written by one of the monks in praise of digital materials, which, in his eyes, are 'as exquiste as a patina made from lamp black, Yakskin glue, and brains, burnished to a gloss and inscribed with an ink made from crushed pearls and silver are to me.'
A snip from the poem:

<em>'The light of the disk is endless
like the light of the disks in the sky, sun and moon. </em>

<em>With a single push of our finger on a button
We pull up the shining gems of text.' </em>

<em>-- Gelek Rinpoche</em></blockquote>
