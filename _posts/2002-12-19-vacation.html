It's hard to work when your vacation starts after tomorrow. Almost no one is here at work. My boss is out today and tomorrow. On Monday, I'm on vacation (from work...) for two weeks though I'll just be home. I took my test team (all three of them) out to lunch at Claimjumpers today as a morale event. It seemed like a good way to kill time.

I'm contemplating whether it would make sense for me to switch from Greek to Latin. The same school that teaches Ancient Greek, the <a href="http://www.sealang.com">Seattle Language Academy</a>, also teaches Latin. They have a Latin 101 class starting next term (as well as the Ancient Greek 102 class that I'm currently registered too). I've been wondering... Greek makes a lot of sense for my interests but the same could be said for Latin as the language of scholars and philosophy as well. It's also a lot easier by my teacher's own admission (he teaches both classes...).

Decisions...descisions... feel free to offer advice.

Other than that, I need to polish up the last of the rituals for the Archons (read archangels) from the Ogdoadic tradition. Our citadel (read lodge) has been doing a series of elemental invocations working with the Archons and I wrote three out of the four. I should finish the fourth and figured out whether I'm going to put them on Ogdoadic.com or not.

I found out that <a href="http://www.cmc.net/~amrita/">Chagdud Gonpa Amrita</a> is offering, via a visiting Nyingma lama (Loga Rinpoche), the Wrathful Guru Rinpoche and a Amitabha <a href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/tibetan/teaching_of_phowa.htm">Phowa</a> empowerment in mid-January. I'm considering attending those though I am focussing more on my western magical work at the moment.

I need to begin getting papers and packets together for the classes that the Citadel wants to offer in a couple of months as an introductory hermeticism course as well. Much scanning and photocopying along with other preparation.
