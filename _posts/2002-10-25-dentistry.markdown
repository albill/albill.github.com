So I have a bit of a dental phobia at times...

When I was younger, I had really crooked teeth and they weren't in the best of shape. Growing up, I was never really taught much to take care of them and I didn't see a dentist more often than every couple of years until I was in my late teens. I figure it was because my family was poor. My mother and father both have fairly so-so or bad teeth (depending on the person).

In my very late teens, I had a root canal, not from decay but because they think the tooth got damaged by a blow (sports or something) as a child. Later on, I had enough problems because of how crooked my teeth were that I started to take care of them a lot better. My dentist told me that I'd probably start losing my teeth in my thirties if I didn't have them straightened because they were near impossible for me to clean at home. So, six years ago, I had a couple of teeth pulled to make room and had adult orthodontia for three year and something years. About 2 1/2 years ago, I had the braces taken off and I've had a retainer (mostly at night now) ever since... When I had my braces on, I had professional cleaning done every three months up until the last year.

The issue is that I haven't had a thorough cleaning or examination of my teeth since I had the braces up. I don't know if I was fed up with dental stuff after all of the pain and trauma of the braces or if I was just avoiding the whole thing. Probably both. I brush often but I haven't flossed much. At this point, I have some very obvious (to me when I look) built up tartar on the inner side of my lower teeth and I wouldn't be surprised if I had a cavity or two because of the difficulty cleaning my teeth while I was wearing the braces which haven't been treated since... I get antsy when I think about it so I've just been avoiding thinking about it for the last year and a half. Finally, I looked at them last night and realized that my gums aren't happy, I have tartar built up in all of the standard places (by the saliva glands, etc) and it will not get better on its own. It only gets worse. That's kind of the standard rule in dental stuff. It won't get better so you should keep up on it to keep it from going bad in the first place or to get problems stopped before they happen.

So, I looked up a thread from the local Church of Mez e-mail list last month on recommended dentists. I didn't like my last dentist much. He seemed overly inclined to advise money making (for him) things like tooth whitening and other prettifying procedures. Someone mentioned a lot of good things about Dr. Ethan Janson at <a href="http://www.seattle-dentist.com">seattle-dentist.com</a>. How he'd saved teeth that others had given up on, how they were very gentle there and did sonic cleanings, etc. I made an appointment for Halloween morning to go in there.

This may seem like a small deal to readers but I have a lifetime of minor dental issues and phobias that I struggle against. I'm told my teeth are actually pretty middle of the road. I have a lot of fillings but only the one root canal beyond that. It's a struggle for me to get back on the course of taking care of my teeth, seeing a dentist and finding out what list of work may need to be done in my mouth (something I'm always afraid of hearing). I suspect that I'll need a bit more than a cleaning but, as I said, my mouth isn't going to get better on its own so I need to confront this head on and do something about it. I just wish it didn't make me twitchy.
