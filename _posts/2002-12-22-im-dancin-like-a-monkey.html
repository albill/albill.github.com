So,  R is in North Carolina for a week and I have two weeks off from work! Woo hoo!

I went to Rubylous's annual winter solstice gathering last night and hung out for a number of hours. Ran into a lot of LJ people but I don't remember all of the usernames. ;-)

Tylik is big into wu shu these days, which you know if you know her. We got discussing martial arts with a group and I mentioned that R and I are thinking of beginning some training. Along with all of those nice health and mental benefits, I require combat effectiveness. Brazilian ju-jitsu was mentioned to me but I pointed out that it is so popular that it is hard to know the quality of the different schools teaching. My old sensei (six years ago) was studying a comparable Japanese family style with a private instructor and he spoke highly of the Brazilians but that was because they were largely doing the same family style practices. My old sensei was a bit turned off by the commericalism and sensationism of the Brazilian crowd. I mentioned that Silat had been recommended to me, as had Kali and a couple of people seconded the Kali recommendation.

One thing that I did hear about which I had only vaguely heard before was a recommendation for Krav Maga, the Israeli self-defense techniques. It turns out Seattle is one of the few places in the U.S. where it is taught. I don't know much about it and it's hard to get a sense of things from reading and web pages. One thing I'm not sure about it is that, given its background, they seem to run things more like classes for cops than they do as an ongoing self-defense school. Something to consider anyway...

Sarastro is sick so we're not doing ritual work tonight with our group. I'm about to leave to go to the annual OTO yule potluck and mass. That should be good.

After that, I get to come home and play x-box and scratch my ass in my boxers for two weeks! I'm thinking of trying to work though Ficino's "Platonic Theology" during vacation but we'll see...
