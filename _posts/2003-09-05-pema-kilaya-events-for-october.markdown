The Four Immeasurables

Love, Compassion, Joy, Equanimity.  These four, when taken to an ultimate point, describe the inner state of vast expansive Bodhicitta mind.  Cultivating this state through the use of the Four Immeasurables will help to inspire and improve the connection between oneself and all other sentient beings, laying the groundwork to become a Bodhisattva.

<strong>Tara, The 21 Emanations
Oral Transmission, Practice and Teaching by Kilung Jigme Rinpoche
October 4th, Saturday, 1:00-6:00 p.m.
Seattle First Baptist Church, 1111 Harvard Avenue
</strong>(one block West of Broadway &amp; E. Union, behind the Polyclinic)

Tara, Mother of the Buddhas, who swiftly comes to the aid of those in need, is a Buddha herself.  Known as "The Savioress," she is a favorite among Tibetans and many others around the world. Tara has 21 emanations, the most popular being Green Tara and White Tara.  But to hear her other names is to begin to understand her vast scope.  For example, "She Who Is Unconquerable and Victorious," "Dweller in the Mountains," and "Lady Who Is Ablaze With Light." Teachings are often given on one of the Taras,
but here Rinpoche will offer a teaching on her full range.

Also included will be a lung (oral transmission), and a full and short practice.

Suggested Donation $35.  Open <span>dana</span> to Rinpoche.
Please bring your own meditation cushion.

The Paramitas Step by Step
October 7th, Tuesday, 7:00 p.m.
1617 Summit, #13, Seattle</strong>

The great ocean of activity of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas is based upon These Six Perfections.  The practice of these virtues is folded into daily life experience, leading to development of inner and outer yoga tantra. Rinpoche will present the first two Paramitas of Generosity and discipline this Autumn, and continue, two Paramitas at a time, with each of his visits to Seattle.

The Four Thoughts That Turn the Mind is the basic opener to the gate of Dharma.  In them we find a system of motivation to use throughout our Dharma paths, all the way from most beginning to realization.  It is the beginning of the Foundation practices (Ngondro), and is taught in Point One of Mind Training Practice (Lojong).	Vipassana is the meditation of the wisdom of emptiness.  It is practiced while maintaining Shamatha meditation as the foundation.  Stabilization in Shamatha will then lead to fast development of Vipassana insight.  Rinpoche will lead us in this practice during the mini retreat.

Suggested Donation $40.  Open <span>dana</span> to Rinpoche.

Bodhicitta in Action: Life Saving &amp; Other Practices
October 13th, Monday, 7:00 p.m.
Seattle First Baptist Church, 1111 Harvard Avenue
</strong>(one block west of Broadway &amp; E. Union, behind the Polyclinic)

Life Saving is an ancient practice of India and Tibet, where live fish, yak, goats, insects, and others are released back into the wild, saving them from slaughter.  In giving beings life, one puts generosity, compassion, and love into vivid practice while generating merit for oneself and all beings.  This is one of several Bodhicitta practices Rinpoche will teach this evening.
