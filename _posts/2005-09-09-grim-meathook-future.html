That's what Warren Ellis calls the current dark vision that things like New Orleans' last week paint. This could be any of our cities with the right disaster. Are you ready for the civilization in your area to disintegrate around you? What would you do?<br /><br />On a more positive note, I haven't been posting much because school is kicking my ass right now. Between working full time, trying to do my assigned reading on Edmund Burke and Thomas Paine, and writing a paper for my other class on Flannery O'Connor, I've been busy. I've also attended two meetings with the Stonecutters this week but that was voluntary and I'm glad that I did.<br /><br />We leave for Thailand in a bit over two weeks. I suppose I should get packing and planning. I need more hot weather clothing and a hat.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to going but it is going to fuck up my school schedule something fierce since I have a paper due either when I'm there or the week that I get back. Feh.
