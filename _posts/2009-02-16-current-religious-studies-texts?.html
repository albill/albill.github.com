One of the bits of advice that I've been given of study that I can do during the next six months is to get a decent basis of understanding of the current field of Religious Studies. This would help me be in a good place for the beginning of my doctoral work. I know one or more scholars of Religious Studies read my journal on occasion and plenty of people with a more than passing interest in the topic as an academic discipline. I would love to hear suggestions of solid texts to provide a firm foundation in Religious Studies, especially any that are inclusive of Buddhism (not being purely focused on "Western" religions).
