I just found out that a friendly acquaintance of mine, Leigh Ann, was killed last night in a motorcycle accident. She was one of the OTO people that I had met in the Bay Area through my attending of PantheaCon and going to other events down there over the last few years.

I remember hearing music that she had done for the Gnostic Mass a few years ago and being impressed with the amount of work that she had put into creating it.

I cannot say she was a friend because we didn't know each other well but she is someone that I had a lot of respect for and who I was looking forward to getting to know following the move. She will be missed.
