The second <strong>Ex Templo</strong> Podcast is now available. This is really the first real podcast since the previous one was just a "welcome to the podcast" entry. I interviewed Rev. Jiun Foster of <a href="http://www.daiun-ji.org/">Daiun-Ji Great Cloud Temple</a> in Cincinnati, Ohio yesterday.

It is up on the <a href="http://www.extemplo.org/"><strong>Ex Templo</strong></a> blog <a href="http://www.extemplo.org/?p=4">here</a>.

I'm enclosing the file below for those that read my blog on Arcanology.com as well but I won't be necessarily doing it for every podcast.
