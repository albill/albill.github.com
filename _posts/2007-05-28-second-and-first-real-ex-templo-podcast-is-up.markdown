The second **Ex Templo** Podcast is now available. This is really the
first real podcast since the previous one was just a "welcome to the
podcast" entry. I interviewed Rev. Jiun Foster of [Daiun-Ji Great Cloud
Temple](http://www.daiun-ji.org/) in Cincinnati, Ohio yesterday. It is
up on the [**Ex Templo**](http://www.extemplo.org/) blog
[here](http://www.extemplo.org/?p=4). I'm enclosing the file below for
those that read my blog on Arcanology.com as well but I won't be
necessarily doing it for every podcast.
