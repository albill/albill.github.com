I and many other Mozilla people are in the Vancouver airport now. We
survived the six or seven hour bus ride in order to hang out at the
airport for a few hours. [From the
news](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7535840.stm), I see that bus rides in
Canada can be a dangerous experience. Luckily, no one went all
"Highlander" on us and we arrived intact. I expect that Canada will end
its attempts to kill us now. Now I need coffee to go with the three or
so hours of sleep. \
