We're back from Egypt (and back at work, in fact). Our cats are pleased and I've uploaded my photos to Flickr over the last day. I have a number of friends who had asked about seeing pictures once we returned.

You can see the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/collections/72157608214039341/">full collection</a> of them there. There are more than a few hundred photos so I've broken them up, to a fair degree, by location but I haven't labeled any of them yet to say what they show in detail. I may do this eventually if I have time but it won't be soon.

At this point, my body is trying to figure out what side of the planet I am in (I seem to randomly wake up at 2:00 AM). As an aside, I did received my official GRE scores and was given a "5.5" grade on my Analytical essay portion (out of 1 to 6 in half point increments), which is the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile. I expect that a Verbal and Analytical score at the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile will suffice to keep the admissions group happy. Now I just need to get two of the people writing my letters of recommendation to send them into the school and my application will be done. Since I have another month and a half, I'm sure it will work out. Then I get to wait and see if I'm accepted into the doctoral program or not for next Fall.
