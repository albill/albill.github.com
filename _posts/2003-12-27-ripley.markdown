I watched <b>Ripley&apos;s Game</b> this evening. This is a sequel to <b>The Talented Mr. Ripley</b> inasmuch as it is a movie version of one of the later novels about Tom Ripley by the same author. This is decades later and Ripley is married and an art dealer in Italy. He is played quite aptly by John Malkavich. 

I found myself enjoying the movie quite a bit. Ripley is such an amoral character, only evil in that he seems to utterly lack a conscience, except when it shows up surprisingly, even for him. Bad things don&apos;t bother him and it is all a game. At one point in the movie, he tells another character that part of the secret of doing such bad acts as killing people is the realization that no one is watching and you can do what you want really.
