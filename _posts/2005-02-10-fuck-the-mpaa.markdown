The illegal downloading of motion pictures robs thousands of honest, 
hard-working people of their livelihood, and stifles creativity. Illegally 
downloading movies from sites such as these without proper authorization 
violates the law, is theft, and is not anonymous. Stealing movies leaves a 
trail. The only way not to get caught is to stop.</h3>
