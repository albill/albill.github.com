the following, which means that I suppose they lost their court fight:

### There are websites that provide legal downloads. This is not one of
them.

### This website has been permanently shut down by court order because
it facilitates the illegal downloading of copyrighted motion pictures.
The illegal downloading of motion pictures robs thousands of honest,
hard-working people of their livelihood, and stifles creativity.
Illegally downloading movies from sites such as these without proper
authorization violates the law, is theft, and is not anonymous. Stealing
movies leaves a trail. The only way not to get caught is to stop.
