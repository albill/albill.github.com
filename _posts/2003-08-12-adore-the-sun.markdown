<blockquote><em>The sun is chanting his ancient song
In contest with the brother spheres,
Rolling with thunder steps along,
Down the predestined course of years.
His presence gives the angels might,
Though fathom it none ever may.
And Thy sublime works still are bright
With splendor of Creation's day.</em></blockquote>
"Prologue in Heaven" to Goethe's "Faust"
