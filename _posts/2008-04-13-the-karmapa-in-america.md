This visit to the United States is the first time that he has been able to come here to visit or to teach.

The Karmapa is the head of the <a href="http://www.kagyuoffice.org/">Karma Kagyu</a> school within the Kagyu branch of Tibetan Buddhism.  He was born in Tibet and recognized as the new Karmapa there, with the oversight of the Chinese government. In 2000, he secretly escaped from his monastery with a few others and fled to India. In India, his movements are fairly restricted by the Indian government (a virtual house arrest, in my opinion) and he hasn't been allowed to travel often outside of the Dharamsala area, where most of the Tibetans in India live.

He will be teaching in New York City, Boulder, and Seattle. Tickets for these events go on sale this week (starting tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM Eastern Time).

The schedule of events is as follows:
