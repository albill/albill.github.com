The 18th Annual Mind and Life Conference in India is going on this week.
The [Mind & Life Institute](http://www.mindandlife.org/) brings together
scientists and Buddhists in dialogue, including the Dalai Lama, to
discuss important issues relating to the mind, contemplation, and
science. You can see the
[brochure](http://www.mindandlife.org/Dharamsala-Apr6-2009Brochure.pdf)
for this year for more information. From the overview:

> "The topics of Mind and Life XVIII are human attention, memory, and
> the mind considered from phenomenological (including contemplative),
> psychological, and neurobiological perspectives. While the relation
> between attention, memory, and the mind is a fascinating area of
> research in psychological science and neuroscience, it is also of
> particular interest and investigation in Buddhism, because it is
> through the contemplative refinement of attention and mindfulness that
> one explores the distinctive characteristics, origins, and potentials
> of human awareness, of suffering, and of genuine happiness. In short,
> the contemplative training known as “shamatha” (meditative quiescence)
> deals with the development and refinement of attention; and this is
> the basis for “vipashyana” (contemplative insight), which entails
> methods for experientially exploring the nature of the mind and its
> relation to the world at large. [...] The discussions during Mind and
> Life XVIII will primarily focus on the subjective phenomenology,
> information-processing operations, and neural mechanisms of attention,
> memory, and conscious awareness from both scientific and Buddhist
> perspectives. We expect that participants in these dialogues, coming
> from the various disciplines of philosophy, psychology, neuroscience,
> and Buddhist scholarship and contemplative practice will especially
> work toward understanding and incorporating the broad range of each
> others’ ideas and views about the topics of this meeting."

I have heard that the initial results of B. Alan Wallace's **Shamatha
Project** will be (or have been) presented during the conference. It
turns out that is is being [blogged](http://www.mindandlife.org/blog/)
live this week as things progress.
