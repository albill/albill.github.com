These are hymns used within Aurum Solis rituals in honor of the three deities of the Constellation of the Worshipped: Leukothea, Melnaotheos, and Agathodaimon.

<strong>Casmen I</strong>
Thus shall be the praise of Leukothea; ever thus while praise shall be:-
The crystal-flashing splendour of her love pervades all things, nourishing and renewing.
Of her bounty she gives secret dew into an earthen cup: those who love her drink deeply of it, and she casts around then brightness of her regard.
Where is the Great Serpent, where is he, her Lord? She has overcome him, she has shattered his fangs: from her womb is he born anew, a toothless babe.
Yet she is the Ally of the Strong, a mighty helper to the Sons and Daughters of Gnosis.
Before the white-fire face of the Moon she chants in shadow, and the Moon's self stoops to hear the song of allurement.
Before the white-fire face of the moon she chants; and a lone devotee, enscorcelled, staff broken and magick set at naught, casts himself, powerless, into the dark pull of her being. Thus without choice he waits, until the vision of splendour and flame arise, and wisdom be his, or madness.
Upon her palm the single flame quivers, seeming air-nurtured. Hand upon hand. Sign most awesome.
The beryl-stone in her circlet becomes a pool filled with waters of compassion and clear vision; whoso gazes therein shall mount a winged steed.
The crystal-flashing splendour of her love pervades all things, nourishing and renewing.

<strong>Casmen II</strong>
Hear of the Oracles concerning Melanotheos.
He is the pursuer of all who seek him not:
They awaken, they turn to find what has bestirred them;
But he has withdrawn. Beyond the deep of night he has withdrawn.
To the imaging of the mind's lone seeking
The Unmanifest seems as the myriad flame-particles which shadow forth his being.
One only is there, one in all her forms, to whom without cease he draws nigh.
She whom he seeks is found, and sought, and found in all worlds to Time's ending.
Therefore as a quest is Existence transmitted to all;
Therefore is Love the pulse of all being, and the lance of Light is the source of life.
In silence and darkness he moves
But that which he has wrought shines in flame, dances in water,
And to all who know him through that which he has wrought, the Father of All is manifold:
The thronging Star-Lords, Daimones,
The glittering dew of heaven imaging the seed-horde of godhead -
The myriad of the star-host in the body of the Goddess of Infinite Space.
She gives her oneness to that multitude, for to her he is one,
And the Gnostic for whom she is Wisdom knows him as one, Melanotheos.
Io, Melanotheos!
Daimones Poliastres, Io!

<strong>Casmen III</strong>
The Holy One shall arise
And his voice shall cry in the dawn,
Yea, his mighty voice shall cry in the dawn.
He shall go forth in his name Knouphis
And his crown of light shall enkindle the worlds.
A thousand Aeons shall adore him,
And men shall seek death.
The earth shall tremble,
The voice of the Holy One shall sound in the tempest.
The Gnostic shall stand in contemplation.
He shall lift up his hands in adoration.
Above him shall be the Diadem of Light,
And these shall be the words of the Gnostic:-"Terror and vastness are about me,
But the broad wings of the serpent enfold me.
The fleeing darkness is before me,
But I keep in concealment the glory which is mine
And time is not yet when I shall unveil my face;
Yet I stand in majesty and power and bliss unending."
These shall be the words of the Gnostic in adoration of the Holy One.
