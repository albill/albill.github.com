As I wrote the other day, we realized that the periodic damp spot on the
counter in the basement was caused by leaking from the dishwasher. I
pulled the grate off the bottom of the dishwasher tonight and looked
underneath. Whoa. What a mess.

It looks like either the motor or the water line (I assume the former
since it only happens when we run it) has been leaking. The floor under
the dishwasher is buckled and ruined as well. It's so warped that it
looks like a wave under there. I looked at the linoleum and floor just
on the other side of the vertical cabinet wall where the dishwasher is
and the the flooring is pealing back. I pulled it back and smelled
mildew and rot. The water damage extends for three or so inches on that
side as well.

I went downstairs and peered at the ceiling, behind ducks and cabinets,
etc. in the area below and where the small puddle has been noticed
before. I see no visible signs of water damage and the dry wall isn't
brittle like it is in my bathroom ceiling where we had the leak. I'm
hoping that this means that the dishwasher, which we only run about once
a week, only destroyed the flooring underneath of it and that the damage
isn't extensive beyond that.

I'm going to try to figure out how to disconnect the dishwasher without
spraying water from it's feed line. I may have to call a plumber but I
would hope to avoid it for something as simple as disconnecting a
dishwasher. Really, what I'll need is a carpenter contractor to rip up
the flooring when the dishwasher is pulled out to see how extensive the
damage is and to repair it.

I'm not going to pay someone $85 an hour for that, that's for sure. If
anyone local to me has a good carpenter for this sort of work, let me
know.
