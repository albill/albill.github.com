I ordered <a href="http://shenku.com/frontcover.htm">this</a> freaky boo, <strong><a href="http://www.epinions.com/content_42130771588">The Art of Shen-Ku</a></strong>, this evening (for about half price). I've flipped through it off and on and it seems a fun combination of (a) freaky, (b) informative, (c) fun, and (d) downright odd. I finally decided to get it but I figured that I'd save a few beans. ;-)
