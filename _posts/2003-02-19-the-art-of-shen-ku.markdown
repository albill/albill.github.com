I ordered [this](http://shenku.com/frontcover.htm) freaky boo, **[The
Art of Shen-Ku](http://www.epinions.com/content_42130771588)**, this
evening (for about half price). I've flipped through it off and on and
it seems a fun combination of (a) freaky, (b) informative, (c) fun, and
(d) downright odd. I finally decided to get it but I figured that I'd
save a few beans. ;-)
