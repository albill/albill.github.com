<img width="211" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="286" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.zhangzhung.net/lj/red-tara.jpg" />I got a reminder newsletter in my snail mail today that mentioned that <a href="http://www.cmc.net/%7Eamrita/">Chagdud Gonpa Amrita</a> is offering the Red Tara Empowerment on August 8.

This local group also gets together on Monday nights to do the Red Tara Practice together so it would be an opportunity to take the empowerment and possibly have a group to practice it with... I'm planning on attending this.

I also received the newsletter for the <a href="http://www.sakya.org/vei/">Virupa Ecumenical Institute</a> today. They list the following in August:

<strong>Medicine Buddha: Meditation and Healing Through Sacred Dance Movement</strong>
Prema Dasara and Anahata Iradah

Tuesday, August 13, 7:30 PM
$10 Public, $8 Sakya Monastery members
$5 Students and Senios

<em>Beginning and Intermediate Levels</em>

This sacred dance invokes the power of the Medicine Buddha for developing our wisdom and for healing afflictions of body and mind. At the request of Lama Lhundrup, Prema Dasara and Anahata Iradah developed this movement meditation for the nuns of Kopan Monastery in Nepal. As the basis for the dance, the nuns offered a four-line prayer they use when making Medicine Buddha Sand Mandalas. The traditional melody for the mantra resonates deeply and is set in the context of a simple sadhana practice. Medicine Buddha's mantra purifies illness and removes obstacles from our spiritual journey. This class is a powerful inner and outer experience and the actitivities of the Dharma. For more information on this event and the activities of Prema and Anahata, please view the website of Tara Dhatu at <a href="http://www.taradhatu.org/">http://www.taradhatu.org/</a>
