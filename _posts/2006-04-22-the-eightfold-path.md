It is another day for Buddhist posts. This is long so feel free not to read it if you care little for such things. The Buddha taught an Eightfold Path as the way to achieve enlightenment and  end suffering. The following was written by someone else (I'm not sure who) but  I'll quote it here because it does a good job at covering things. I've reorganized it lightly in places.

<strong>The Noble Eightfold Path</strong>

It consists of:
<ol>
	<li>Right View</li>
	<li>Right Intention</li>
	<li>Right Speech</li>
	<li>Right Action</li>
	<li>Right Livelihood</li>
	<li>Right Effort</li>
	<li>Right Mindfulness</li>
	<li>Right Concentration</li>
</ol>
The Noble Eightfold Path describes  		the way to the end of suffering, as it was laid out by Siddhartha  		Gautama. It is a practical guideline to ethical and mental development  		with the goal of freeing the individual from attachments and delusions;  		and it finally leads to understanding the truth about all things.  		Together with the 		Four Noble  		Truths it constitutes the gist of Buddhism. Great emphasis is put on  		the practical aspect, because it is only through practice that one can  		attain a higher level of existence and finally reach enlightenment. The eight  		aspects of the path are not to be understood as a sequence of single  		steps, instead they are highly interdependent principles that have to be  		seen in relationship with each other.

<strong>1. Right View</strong>

Right view is the beginning and the end of the path, it simply means  		to see and to understand things as they really are and to realize the  		Four Noble Truths. As such, right view is the cognitive aspect of wisdom.  		It means to see things through, to grasp the impermanent and imperfect  		nature of worldly objects and ideas, and to understand the law of karma  		and karmic conditioning. Right view is not necessarily an intellectual  		capacity, just as wisdom is not just a matter of intelligence. Instead,  		right view is attained, sustained, and enhanced through all capacities  		of mind. It begins with the intuitive insight that all beings are  		subject to suffering and it ends with complete understanding of the true  		nature of all things. Since our view of the world forms our thoughts and  		our actions, right view yields right thoughts and right actions.

<strong>2. Right Intention</strong>

While right view refers to the cognitive aspect of wisdom, right  		intention refers to the volitional aspect, i.e. the kind of mental  		energy that controls our actions. Right intention can be described best  		as <em>commitment</em> to ethical and mental self-improvement. Buddha  		distinguishes three types of right intentions:
<ol>
	<li>the intention of  		renunciation, which means resistance to the pull of desire.</li>
	<li>the  		intention of good will, meaning resistance to feelings of anger and  		aversion.</li>
	<li>the intention of harmlessness, meaning not to think or  		act cruelly, violently, or aggressively, and to develop compassion.</li>
</ol>
<strong>3. Right Speech</strong>

Right speech is the first principle of ethical conduct in the  		eightfold path. Ethical conduct is viewed as a guideline to <em>moral  		discipline</em>, which supports the other principles of the path. This  		aspect is not self-sufficient, however, essential, because mental  		purification can only be achieved through the cultivation of ethical  		conduct. The importance of speech in the context of Buddhist ethics is  		obvious: words can break or save lives, make enemies or friends, start  		war or create peace. Buddha explained right speech as follows:
<ol>
	<li>to  		abstain from false speech, especially not to tell deliberate lies and  		not to speak deceitfully.</li>
	<li>to abstain from slanderous speech and not  		to use words maliciously against others.</li>
	<li>to abstain from harsh words  		that offend or hurt others.</li>
	<li>to abstain from idle chatter that  		lacks purpose or depth.</li>
</ol>
Positively phrased, this means to tell the  		truth, to speak friendly, warm, and gently and to talk only when  		necessary.

<strong>4. Right Action</strong>

The second ethical principle, right action, involves the body as  		natural means of expression, as it refers to deeds that involve bodily  		actions. Unwholesome actions lead to unsound states of mind, while  		wholesome actions lead to sound states of mind. Again, the principle is  		explained in terms of abstinence: right action means
<ol>
	<li>to abstain from  		harming sentient beings, especially to abstain from taking life  		(including suicide) and doing harm intentionally or delinquently.</li>
	<li>to  		abstain from taking what is not given, which includes stealing, robbery,  		fraud, deceitfulness, and dishonesty.</li>
	<li>to abstain from sexual  		misconduct.</li>
</ol>
Positively formulated, right action means to act kindly and  		compassionately, to be honest, to respect the belongings of others, and  		to keep sexual relationships harmless to others. Further details  		regarding the concrete meaning of right action can be found in the 		Buddhist Precepts.

<strong>5. Right Livelihood</strong>

Right livelihood means that one should earn one's living in a  		righteous way and that wealth should be gained legally and peacefully.  		The Buddha mentions four specific activities that harm other beings and  		that one should avoid for this reason:
<ol>
	<li>dealing in weapons.</li>
	<li>dealing  		in living beings (including raising animals for slaughter as well as  		slave trade and prostitution).</li>
	<li>working in meat production and  		butchery.</li>
	<li>selling intoxicants and poisons, such as alcohol and  		drugs.</li>
</ol>
Furthermore any other occupation that would violate the  		principles of right speech and right action should be avoided.

<strong>6. Right Effort</strong>

Right effort can be seen as a prerequisite for the other principles  		of the path. Without effort, which is in itself an act of will, nothing  		can be achieved, whereas misguided effort distracts the mind from its  		task, and confusion will be the consequence. Mental energy is the force  		behind right effort; it can occur in either wholesome or unwholesome  		states. The same type of energy that fuels desire, envy, aggression, and  		violence can on the other side fuel self-discipline, honesty,  		benevolence, and kindness. Right effort is detailed in four types of  		 endeavors that rank in ascending order of perfection:
<ol>
	<li>to prevent the  		arising of unarisen unwholesome states.</li>
	<li>to abandon unwholesome states  		that have already arisen.</li>
	<li>to arouse wholesome states that have not  		yet arisen.</li>
	<li>to maintain and perfect wholesome states already  		arisen.</li>
</ol>
<strong>7. Right Mindfulness</strong>

Right mindfulness is the controlled and perfected faculty of  		cognition. It is the mental ability to see things as they are, with  		clear consciousness. Usually, the cognitive process begins with an  		impression induced by perception, or by a thought, but then it does not  		stay with the mere impression. Instead, we almost always conceptualize  		sense impressions and thoughts immediately. We interpret them and set  		them in relation to other thoughts and experiences, which naturally go  		beyond the facticity of the original impression. The mind then posits  		concepts, joins concepts into constructs, and weaves those constructs  		into complex interpretative schemes. All this happens only half  		consciously, and as a result we often see things obscured. Right  		mindfulness is anchored in clear perception and it penetrates  		impressions without getting carried away. Right mindfulness enables us  		to be aware of the process of conceptualization in a way that we  		actively observe and control the way our thoughts go. Buddha accounted  		for this as the <em>four foundations of mindfulness: </em>
<ol>
	<li>contemplation  		of the body.</li>
	<li>contemplation of feeling (repulsive, attractive, or	neutral).</li>
	<li>contemplation of the state of mind.</li>
	<li>contemplation of  		the phenomena.</li>
</ol>
<strong>8. Right Concentration</strong>

The eighth principle of the path, right concentration, refers to the  		development of a mental force that occurs in natural consciousness,  		although at a relatively low level of intensity, namely concentration.  		Concentration in this context is described as one-pointedness of mind,  		meaning a state where all mental faculties are unified and directed onto  		one particular object. Right concentration for the purpose of the  		eightfold path means wholesome concentration, i.e. concentration  		on wholesome thoughts and actions. The Buddhist method of choice to  		develop right concentration is through the practice of meditation. The  		meditating mind focuses on a selected object. It first directs itself  		onto it, then sustains concentration, and finally intensifies  		concentration step by step. Through this practice it becomes natural to  		apply elevated levels concentration also in everyday situations.
