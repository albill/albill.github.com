This is just a note that while I find St. Augustine readable, I think I've read too much of him.

I have to get through this one chapter on the antecedents to and influences on the Golden Dawn's conception of the soul before I finally get to write quite heavily from the Golden Dawn material. This one chapter is taking more work than I would ever have imagined a month ago. Argh!!!

I feel like I'm writing a dissertation, not a thesis...
