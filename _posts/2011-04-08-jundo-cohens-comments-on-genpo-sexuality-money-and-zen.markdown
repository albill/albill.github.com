Jundo Cohen of [Treeleaf Zendo](http://www.treeleaf.org/) offers his
amazing, insightful, and *hilarious* commentary on Genpo Merzel,
sexuality, money, and Zen in a video he posted on April Fool's Day,
2011. I encourage everyone to watch it unless they have no sense of
humor.

*Extra points for placing Genpo Merzel and Brad Warner in the
same...position...in his announcements.*
