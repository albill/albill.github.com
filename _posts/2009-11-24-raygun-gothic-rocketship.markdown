When people talk about Burning Man, they are generally obligated to
speak about the art that occurs there. People build large, intricate,
and amazing art pieces (and tiny, insignificant, and funny pieces as
well!) for Burning Man. That said, the reality of Burning Man for a lot
of people is less about the art and more about community, a big party,
and often being mentally "adjusted" at the event. I've always been
amazed at the creativity of some of the work that I've seen in the three
times I've been (2001, 2006, 2008) to the playa. I think the 3D Maze
that was a three story tall cube that I saw my first year blew my mind
the most completely. Recently, a local Oakland crew built a Golden Age
streamlined rocketship for Burning Man as a sponsored art project. I've
seen a few pictures of it but heard no details and hadn't seen it for
myself. As it turns out, a short documentary was produced about it that
my wife sent over to me this morning. I just watched it and found it
both interesting and moving enough in its display of the work of the
artists and of the artists, themselves, that I wanted to share it with
my friends. The work to create something collaborative and cool, just
because, is such a high point for this kind of art. You can watch it
below or [go to Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/7743222) to see it in a larger
size.
