                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <b>FileStore2</b> module (and the underlying <b>Fsrch</b> module that was likely to be the problem). I recreated the tables. Result: no change whatsoever. Hmmm... I went and looked at my permissions again and whacked with them a bit. It looks like one internal directory needs to be set to the dreaded '666' or something. Well, that's whacked. Luckily, it seems to be a temp folder that doesn't store data for more than a moment. Tried everything again, now it works <b>EXCEPT</b> my initial test file was a word doc. Instead of getting 'access denied' for it, I get garbage data. I uploaded test html, pdf, and text files. They all worked fine. It looks like the server either hates Word (which wouldn't surprise much of the world) or the mime types are whacked or something. This becomes too complex to bother with so I just zip up any individual Word files. This has the added benefit of saving space. Problem solved. I'm going to bed now. For those that care, I actuall think Drupal is pretty good software. It is just a mess to upgrade. At least it is all in PHP, unlike my movable type installation, which is Perl.
