We made it home this morning (local time). We're jetlagged all to hell though.

The cats and ferret are very happy that we have returned but it looks like R's cousin did a good job with them. They weren't eating each other or attacking us as we came in.

I'm off to work tomorrow morning. I'm just catching up on backlogged mail. No paperwork for my thesis was waiting for me so I need to contact my program to get a status report on my committee.
