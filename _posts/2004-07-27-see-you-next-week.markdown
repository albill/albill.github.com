Ho!

In a little over eight hours, I will be on a plane to New Jersey. Once I
land, I'll be picked up by Inominandum, my evil twin. We'll be going to
meet others in our little tantric society for a small retreat in upstate
New York being done by us at a campground. Just eight or ten of us, a
teacher who is also a friend of a number of the members, a bunch of
ritual paraphernalia and some Buddhism with an attitude.

I've got two large duffle bags of camping stuff, my portable espresso
maker and a pound of coffee. I'm ready to go.

See you in about six days...
