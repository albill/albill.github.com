<p>Ho!</p><p>In a little over eight hours, I will be on a plane to New Jersey. Once I land, I&#39;ll be picked up by Inominandum, my evil twin. We&#39;ll be going to meet others in our little tantric society for a small retreat in upstate New York being done by us at a campground. Just eight or ten of us, a teacher who is also a friend of a number of the members, a bunch of ritual paraphernalia and some Buddhism with an attitude.</p><p>I&#39;ve got two large duffle bags of camping stuff, my portable espresso maker 
and a pound of coffee. I&#39;m ready to go.</p><p>See you in about six days...</p><p align="center"><img border="1" src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/twins5-smaller.jpg" width="456" height="372" alt="Separated at birth?" hspace="3" vspace="3"></p>
