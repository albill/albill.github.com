and I went down to Portland this weekend. There was a seminar on Enochian magic done by David R Jones, who I've corresponded with online for many years and then a party for the feast of the first night of the prophet and his bride.

We have friends down there in the Thelemic community, especially notable in , who offered us a place to stay at her house. We got there noonish on Saturday and attended the three and a half or so hours of the lecture (which was quite good and because of which I'm trying to get Jones to actually write some longer articles). After that, we got Thai food with Ariche and crew, crashed for a while and then went to the party. There were people, food, a couple of bands, and a raffle in which R won some cool stuff. All in all, a good time.

Sunday we did the pilgrimage to <a href="http://www.powells.com">Powell's Books</a> and I bought about $80 worth of books including an old translation of the Corpus Hermeticum that I didn't have from about 100 years ago, a book on Hypatia and an introduction to Tibetan Buddhism (Open Secret) that I always liked in a cheap edition that I can lend to friends.

I must say that it is still particularily cool that the <a href="http://www.sekhetmaat.com/">Sekhet Maat Lodge</a> in Portland has its own space that it has a longterm lease on. It's the only OTO group and just about the only Occult or Pagan group that I've ever been around that has managed to do so. I can't recall how long they've had this space but I believe that they've had this one and another for about two years. I've wanted to do something like this in Seattle though I've been thinking more along the lines of a general pagan and esoteric center, not just a Thelemic one.

Now I'm stuck at home, remoting into my work machine, as I wait for the dreaded Cable Guy to show up...
