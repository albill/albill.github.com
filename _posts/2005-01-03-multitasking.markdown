<p>An article out of the Seattle area about Multitasking and how we don&#39;t do it 
very well. It also looks at the costs of it on people... Interesting reading.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>Today, we can do more. And do more, faster. And do more, faster, from 
	anywhere, all the time. You can work at home or the coffee shop or even the 
	beach. Is this a good thing? How do we navigate these rapids without 
	eventually drowning? Are we allowing life to be the sum of tasks, the short 
	term always the priority? Are we so connected that we&#39;re actually 
	disconnected? And has anyone had enough time to focus long enough to mull a 
	question that requires a long, complicated answer - if there is one?</i></p>
