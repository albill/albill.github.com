It's nice to have an extra day off. I got to sleep in until I felt like getting up this morning.

I got up and did some webwork for an hour and a half or so on the site for <a href="http://www.anunnaki.org">the Anunnaki Project</a> in order to try to get things done with a project there. We want to the website do have all of its current projects done before <a href="http://www.anunnaki.org/origins">Origins II</a> this Friday. <strong>Remember to attend this if you are local!</strong>

Eventually, I decided that I needed breakfast food and coffee. I don&apos;t have either here (though I have refrigerated coffee beverages...). I normally get up for work, take a shower, do one or two things and then go immediately to work. I have my coffee there and don't eat until lunchtime (I know... I know...). This leaves my pantry bare of breakfast type things, especially since R and I tend to go out to breakfast on at least one weekend day normally.

I ran off to Noah's, had a bageldog there and then hung out at Seattle's Best Coffee on Broadway drinking a 2o oz. triple white chocolate mocha and reading through my latest novel, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0451458273/">Archangel Protocol</a>, which is actually being quite entertaining. I finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312890729/">King Rat</a> the other day, which was a phenomenal first novel from one of my favorite authors. I also had a short chat with R on the phone and let her know the micro-weasel&apos;s current frisky status.

Through complete chance, I ran into and here on the Hill. I got a chance to chat with her a bit while he got a massage and then we hung out for a little while.

I&apos;m home doing a few computer things now and writing an e-mail to my initiator in the Aurum Solis about spiritual matters. ;-) I'm going to go try to buy some decent shirts in the next little while (I can never find nice cotton shirts that I like...) and then go to fire spinning classÂ this evening.

Busy busy.
