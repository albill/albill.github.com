I'm listening to a bunch of classes that Jiun Sensei did for our sangha,
Daiun-Ji, over the last two years. Listening to these recordings
constantly that have been passed through a low bitrate recorder has
moved me to write a haiku dedicated to him and the Dharma:

*scratchy, distorted, my abbot's voice constantly, cracks jokes while
teaching.*

I think it is time to listen to some Nick Cave or somesuch for a while
now... **Update a few hours later:** I have received the following from
Jiun Sensei:

*demanding students never happy with sensei where is my damn tea?!*

That seems to qualify as a retort...
