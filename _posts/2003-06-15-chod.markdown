So, R and I went to a local gathering of Dzogchen Community people yesterday. She hadn&apos;t been to any Tibetan Buddhist rites of any sort before. 

 Yesterday was the Buddha&apos;s Birthday (at least as popularily attributed) and the Full Moon on official Tibetan calendar. We did a Chod practice twice (which I&apos;d never done before), the short Tun before someone had to go and then the full Ganapuja as Namkhai Norbu has it written out for those of us working in his tradition of practice.

Afterwards, we got a bit of chance to speak with some of the local people.

R went off to a memorial service for an old friend that passed away recently and I went down to see William Kiesel and pick up a hardcover he had for my of Ulansey&apos;s book on Mithras (I had an old, beat up paperback copy before). Along the way, I stopped by Elliott Bay Books, picked up a few used books and lost my credit card. Of course, I discovered this after I left downtown but I&apos;d only used it at Elliott Bay this last week and I didn&apos;t recall the clerk handing it back to me on reflection. They, of course, had it.

In the process of calling them, I stopped by Edge of the Circle books and found that a friend of the owner&apos;s was selling (via the store) a lot of his old books. The person is obviously into Neoplatonic philosophy and Tantra (both Hindu and Buddhist) as well. I picked up the $45 book on Proclus that I almost bought at Field&apos;s in San Francisco last year, a hardcover volume of the Pistis Sophia and Ronald Davis&apos; book on Tantric Buddhism in India and its history before Tibet. This last book, along with Snellgrove&apos;s, are both books that I&apos;ve <b>really</b> wanted to read because they deal with what Tantric Buddhism was before it become enmeshed in Tibetan social structures and monasticism there. All for half cover price.

For those in the Seattle area, Edge has used copies of Shaw&apos;s <b>Theurgy and the Soul</b>, the best book on Iamblichus and theurgy ever, and Finamore&apos;s <b>Iamblichus and the Theory of the Vehicle of the Soul</b> for half price. If you are interested in Iamblichus at all (and you should be as a Western magician), these two are essential reading. The Shaw book is in print but is $45 normally so it is a good thing to get a used copy.

Madeline came over for a few hours this morning for Father&apos;s Day and now it is off to pack for our move into the new house (assuming financing has no issues) by the end of the month.
