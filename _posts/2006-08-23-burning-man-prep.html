What am I missing? I could probably use more food but everything I have can either be eaten directly or with boiled water. I will be there Wednesday through Monday morning and I will be bringing 21 gallons of water, so I should be good there.

I need to figure out where to fill the water unless I want to hall that much water from the Bay Area.
