<p>This is long, overly detailed and probably not worth reading unless you care 
about houses or something.</p>
<p>Originally, I was supposed to have the roof guy come over tomorrow but the 
hole in the roof has been driving me crazy and I can see some water damage in 
the dry wall. Meanwhile, today and tomorrow are supposed to be the dry days this 
week with today being completely sunny.</p>
<p>When I first tried to schedule last week, they had an afternoon slot free 
today but the start time was fuzzy because theoretically, there is a morning job 
starting at 8:00 AM first. I took the 8:00 AM Tuesday one instead because Monday 
was my first day back at work and they couldn&#39;t promise when the guy would show. 
I changed my mind with all of the anxiety the leaking has been causing me. When 
I got up this morning, I called the contract service and they said, &quot;Well, that 
slot was taken but someone just cancelled so we can give you the afternoon slot. 
The handyman will call you around 11:00 AM to tell you when he&#39;ll be there.&quot;</p>
<p>In order to get some real work done, I telecommuted in the meantime. I&#39;d been 
gone last week and almost everyone was still out. I can do a VPN and get onto 
our intranet through my card key and some security hoops. I used the time to 
close old tasks, do the monthly purge of old work e-mail, sent out some notices, 
schedule some reviews, and do bug triage. Around 11:00, the fellow calls me and 
says, &quot;well, I&#39;m kind of tied up here. It might be four or five hours until I 
can come...&quot; <b>WTF?!?!</b> The sun goes down around 4:30 and this guy isn&#39;t 
going to be be doing roof work in the dark. I complained and said, roughly, 
&quot;Dude, I&#39;m here waiting at my house instead of in my office because I need this 
done and I had an appointment for today.&quot; Anyway, he said he&#39;d do what he could 
and if he couldn&#39;t finish, I&#39;d get the original 8:00 AM slot tomorrow.</p>
<p>Well, 3:00 PM rolls around and I&#39;m still working from home. Yee-haw. He calls 
and gets over here about 3:30, which doesn&#39;t make me happy. He&#39;s a nice guy 
though and I try not to give the man, personally, grief. When I called his 
office to confirm that I could still have the appointment tomorrow (because I&#39;m 
like that and I don&#39;t trust people), the woman there gave me the unsolicited 
tale about how his morning appointment had about three times the work that she 
had said that she did and they&#39;d been caught in the middle. </p>
<p>So, around 3:30, he finally gets the guided tour. &quot;Look, water damage. Climb 
up this ladder, look there, place where water comes in roof. etc. etc.&quot; He gets 
up on my roof and finds the source of the problem, which is damaged flashing on 
the sewage vent on the roof. The damage is from when it was put in and then, on 
top of that, they didn&#39;t quite fit the composite roof material over it. So, my 
roof is about eight or nine years old, at a guess, and this has been slowly 
damaging this one spot over this whole time until it finally got through the 
plywood and started dripping inside my attic. Nice. Thanks a lot, fuckheads who 
installed it wrong in the first place.</p>
<p>We debate what he can do and I rule out the cheap and dirty fix which may not 
be perfect. He&#39;s coming back in the morning with a new cover for the pipe to 
replace the entire damaged unit, new composite roof tiles to re-roof around it, 
and maybe some plywood if he needs to replace the damaged substrate. He says 
that I should wait until I have the roof redone for that if possible because 
then we go from a little bitty whole to making a foot or two wide one that he 
then has to seal up again...</p>
<p>While he&#39;s here, I have him look at the water damage. Dry wall is his 
specialty, as it turns out, and I can see the damage (warping) from the wet. 
It&#39;s mostly dry now. He looks at it and says &quot;well, this is probably pretty weak 
now and should be replaced.&quot; He then pokes at it again <b><i>and his hand goes 
through it into my attic.</i></b> &quot;Yep, that&#39;s pretty brittle.&quot; Thanks, Dude. 
I&#39;ll just put some duct tape over the half-fist sized hole in my bathroom 
ceiling. </p>
<p>He&#39;s going to put new drywall in, mud it, etc. but he probably won&#39;t have 
time tomorrow so it will be another trip.</p>
<p>So, what&#39;s the sum total that the fixing of my roof in the one spot and 
fixing the dry wall will cost me? He expects around <font color="#FF0000"><b>
$1,000</b></font>. Jeeezus F. Christ! Well, there goes the money that <i>would</i> 
go into savings for a little while. Let&#39;s hope that my house doesn&#39;t suffer any 
other collapses soon.</p>
