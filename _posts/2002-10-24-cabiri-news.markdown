<b>The Cabiri - October Announcements</b> 


~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
So what are you doing for Halloween?

We&apos;ll be stirring up some trouble at Fremont&apos;s annual Troll-a-gogo event.  Yes, fake blood, girly screams, bloomers, and flying demons - not something I&apos;d want to miss if I were you.  

Get there by 10:30pm or you&apos;ll miss us! For more info, go here:  <a href="http://www.fremontartscouncil.org/events/gogo/index.html">http://www.fremontartscouncil.org/events/gogo/index.html</a>

Advance tickets are a good idea - it sold out last year.  Open to those 21 and older.

And, seeing as how the gift-giving season is approaching, might we suggest donating to your favorite 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization?  Microsoft and Boeing match donations, which means your $150 donation becomes $300.  Neat how that works.  We&apos;re happy to provide our federal EIN to potential donors, just ask!  For details about supporting our organization and where your support dollars will go, visit <a href="http://www.anunnaki.org/organization/">http://www.anunnaki.org/organization/</a>.

We also need some equipment for our rehearsal space; perhaps you can help?  We are currently in search of the following:

Crash pads and/or gym mats for tumbling and aerial (used is OK)
Dance unitards and/or leotards for rehearsal and performance
Serger (for sewing)
Fabric for costume making
Small pickup truck for hauling scenery about town

Thanks to all of our wonderful supporters and volunteers (Al the website guru, Caspian the editor, Rob the graphic designer, and everyone else who helps here and there with our productions) - we couldn&apos;t do it without you!
