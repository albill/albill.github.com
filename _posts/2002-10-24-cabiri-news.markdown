So what are you doing for Halloween? We'll be stirring up some trouble
at Fremont's annual Troll-a-gogo event. Yes, fake blood, girly screams,
bloomers, and flying demons - not something I'd want to miss if I were
you. Get there by 10:30pm or you'll miss us! For more info, go here:

Advance tickets are a good idea - it sold out last year. Open to those
21 and older.

And, seeing as how the gift-giving season is approaching, might we
suggest donating to your favorite 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization?
Microsoft and Boeing match donations, which means your $150 donation
becomes $300. Neat how that works. We're happy to provide our federal
EIN to potential donors, just ask! For details about supporting our
organization and where your support dollars will go, visit
[http://www.anunnaki.org/organization/](http://www.anunnaki.org/organization/).
We also need some equipment for our rehearsal space; perhaps you can
help? We are currently in search of the following: Crash pads and/or gym
mats for tumbling and aerial (used is OK) Dance unitards and/or leotards
for rehearsal and performance Serger (for sewing) Fabric for costume
making Small pickup truck for hauling scenery about town Thanks to all
of our wonderful supporters and volunteers (Al the website guru, Caspian
the editor, Rob the graphic designer, and everyone else who helps here
and there with our productions) - we couldn't do it without you!

from cultures that have passed into antiquity via physical theater and
circus arts). Supporters include the King County Arts Commission. Visit
