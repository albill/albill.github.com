R and I went to the Fire Arts Festival put on by the Crucible last night. We met up with my recent friend, Autumn, and her husband. The event was quite a bit of fun. Lots of fire, lots of Burning Man derived or related art.

The highlight of the evening for us was watching <strong>Dance, Dance Immolation</strong>. DDI is a take on Dance, Dance Revolution with the addition of flame proof bunny suits and flamethrowers. When a player makes too many mistakes or the MC feels so inclined, they get a flamethrower blast in the face. Lots of fun for the whole family!
Here are a few pictures from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157594200045324/">my set</a> on Flickr. We weren't supposed to take photos so I left my real camera at home. The rule turned out to be completely unenforced with many people taking photos so I did a few with my camera on my phone. I apologize for quality issues.
