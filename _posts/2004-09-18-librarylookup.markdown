This is pretty cool Jon Udell wrote a little javascript program that will take the ISBN from a book that you're looking at on Amazon, pop open a new window and check with your local library system to see if it is available. I've been doing this by hand recently, which is how I found the library books that I mentioned recently. If you're running IE, you can put it in the Links bar and I've verified that it works. In Firefox, you can just make it a bookmark and go to it and it will work. You have to be on an Amazon page for a book for it to do anything though. If you're using the King County Library System and having problems getting it to work, I can help you...It works with the common library system software like IPAC. Cool stuff that makes life easier.
