It&#39;s been a busy few days and I haven&#39;t written much... 

My daughter came over last weekend and spent the night. We hung out a bit and watched <b>Spy Kids 2</b> together (which sucked). I prefer the first one, which I had quite enjoyed when it came out. Ah well, I heard the third one is even worse.

Saturday night, R and I celebrated Lamas with our Wiccan HPS and had a little  meeting. That was very nice as she is more on the &quot;earthy&quot; end of things as compared to my own cabalistic-renaissance take on Western spiritual practice. We sat in the backyard around the cauldron, did a short rite and libation and generally enjoyed the night.

Sunday was a gathering at Sarastro&#39;s place to thank those of us that helped him move. The food was good and it was nice to see him but there wasn&#39;t a lot to note here beyond that...

This week has been a difficult work week for reasons that I won&#39;t go into. Suffice it to say that sometimes being in management isn&#39;t just about having fun and being in charge of things.

This evening, R and I went shopping for a suit for me to wear at our wedding in October. We decided a while ago that she would get a nice wedding-type dress and I would get a suite to wear. We went down to Bell Squares and went to a few places. Eventually, we went to the Bon and found a black suite jacket and matching pants there. Given sales and other discounts, I managed to get them for about 60% of what they listed for so I was quite happy. I picked up an off-white dress shirt (which, I am told, matches her dress color pretty well) and a dark 
blue tie to go with it. I&#39;ll have to get some dress shoes later but it was good to get that out of the way. The trick was to find a suit that I&#39;d want to wear after the wedding as well. I&#39;m not exactly a suit guy (hell, I can&#39;t even tie a tie), which won&#39;t surprise anyone that knows me. I&#39;m Mr. Cargo Pants-with-witty-t-shirt most of the time, which is funny given that I&#39;m some 
professional class manager but, hey, fuck it, I don&#39;t like super expensive prissy clothes really. That being said, we did look at Armani suits at Nordstrom&#39;s and if I could afford to dress in a $1,700 Armani suit every day, I would. Those were nice...

<img border="1" src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/Samantabadra_mandala_big.jpg" width="300" height="392" alt="Thangka Image" hspace="7" vspace="2" align="left">I  surprised R with a new piece of art this evening. When I was in New York, I stopped in Woodstock at Dharmawar (<a href="http://www.dharmaware.com">http://www.dharmaware.com</a>) with my friends and looked at the nice thangkas that they had there. Thangkas are Tibetan Buddhist meditation art, usually used to show the imagery of deities for meditative practices. They are also quite beautiful if you&#39;re willing to pay the big bucks to get a really fine one or willing to sherpa one on your back from Nepal yourself (which makes it a lot cheaper but more troublesome...).

I saw a particularly nice Samantabhadra Yab-Yum Thangka while I was there, which was not cheap at all. In any case, when I got home, I showed the image of it on the website to R, along with a few others. She instantly called it out from all of them, which was interesting since it was my favorite from the bunch as well. We discussed getting it for placement in our living room as it is beautiful and we need more beautiful things in our house. It was expensive though so we didn&#39;t agree to get it. On my own, I then contacted the shop and 
paid for it out of some of my savings money (for the good cause of our home) and had it shipped. It arrived today and I brought it into the house when we got home this evening and surprised R with it...

As you can see to the right, it really is quite nice. The painting itself is 18&quot; by 24&quot; and it is surrounded by a silk brocade. I wish we could afford to have more things about this as it is always nice to be surrounded by beautiful, spiritual images.
