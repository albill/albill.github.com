<strong>Rant mode here...</strong>

This has been a hell week.

I get e-mail on Tuesday at work saying "We're moving your e-mail box to a new mail server in another NT domain because you work in the Windows group these days."

They called it being "Windeployed" as it is the Windeploy domain. The nickname for it in my group is "Windestroyed."

The record for fuck ups associated with it is three weeks of domain trust issues, access problems and downtime...

So, Wednesday night, they move my mailserver... I wander in Thursday morning with my printed out instructions on follow up duties to move my mail profile and follow them. Nothing works. I can't get my mail. The mail server won't talk to me and farts in my general direction.

I call helpdesk, as my instructions say... I speak to MULTIPLE incompetents in a couple of different groups over the course of five hours. Meanwhile, my e-mail is down. I'm a lead. I manage a test team. Better yet, we're reorganizing this week and I'm going to be in charge of the testing of new feature work in Internet Explorer going forward and all of that just came down on Monday and Tuesday.... I <strong>need</strong> my e-mail to do my job. Most of my work is mediated via e-mail and meetings (I know, it's a sad life...).

Eventually, at 3:00 pm, I get access to my e-mail and I use it for two hours before leaving for Latin class to get caught up on some work and send out some meeting stuff I'm organizing for 20+ test leads and test plan reviews.

Yesterday, Friday, I come into work in the morning and attempt to log into my computers as a user (not even e-mail specific here). Nope. Can't log in. It doesn't like me. Doesn't recognize my passwords or my username (non-specific error messages are great...)

Call helpdesk. Spend five minutes arguing with a tech that won't listen:

<strong>Him:</strong> "Oh, you have an open ticket from yesterday but its been escalated."
<strong>Me:</strong> "No, dude, this isn't the same problem."
<strong>Him:</strong> "Yes, it is! I'll transfer you."  <em>Repeat for five or ten minutes</em>
<strong>New Guy:</strong> "Hi, I'm your new tech, I understand you're having e-mail issues today."
<strong>Me:</strong> "No, I can't log into my fucking computer. This has nothing to do with e-mail."

Things proceeded downhill from there.

Eventually, the situation works out as follows:
<ol>
	<li>When they moved me to the e-mail server, they weren't supposed to move my domain account, just my e-mail.</li>
	<li>Because of the e-mail only move, they made me an account in the new domain to act as a placeholder but they disabled it for logon since I wasn't supposed to actually use it.</li>
	<li>Some talented new hire then converted my old account in my original domain into a stub to hold my contact information but not as a full account anymore.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Net result:</strong> I have an account in the new domain but it's disabled. My account in the old domain has effectively been deleted. With no functioning accounts, I can't log into the corporate network at all which means I can't get to network resources, my own files, or my e-mail. I can log in as administrator and surf the Internet though. Go figure.

No one had the authority to uncheck the "Disabled" check-box on my account so they had to go call around to find the right administrators. At about 3:00 pm (sound familiar?), they finally activated my disabled account in the new domain. I and the actually competant tech that finally worked with me figured that this was far safer for me than to try to get my original account turned back on (even though I technically shouldn't have lost it).

Total downtime in two work days: 11 hours or so. What was I working on this week? I have no fucking idea now...

On a plus note, when I finally got logged in again and checked my e-mail, I had all of my mail from before the move of mailservers on Wednesday night and I had all of the mail that had been queuing up on Friday but all of my Thursday mail had vanished. I had no mail <strong>from</strong> anyone since the move Wednesday night until Friday and none of the mail (including those big meetings that I scheduled) that I had sent were in my own mailbox. I had to ask my boss to forward me the requests for my own meetings back to me. Nice.

Lessee, total for week:
<ol>
	<li>Reorg of team at work concluding with loss (to a new boss for them) of my two star testers who have only ever worked for me</li>
	<li>Doodle the Ferret dies of cancer, thus traumatizing me and R.</li>
	<li>Two days of non-work involving ever larger increases in blood pressure.</li>
</ol>
Luckily, the curse afflicting me only seems to affect work related stuff and pets so I probably won't die in a car crash before the stars realign. Shit.
