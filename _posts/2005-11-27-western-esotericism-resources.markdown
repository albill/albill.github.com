I'm on the Nature Religion Scholars list (have been for years). This
list is composed of either academics working on the topic of Nature
Religions and Paganism or graduate students working in this area. There
are only a few exceptions (I used to be one) of people who were
grandfathered in when the list went from being very open to only being
open to academics.

Most of the members of the group, at least its leaders, are also
involved with [Pagan Studies.org](http://www.paganstudies.org/) and
making resources available there.

I wonder why these same sorts of resources aren't available to people
studying Western Esotericism.

In theory, the [Association for the Study of
Esotericism](http://www.aseweb.org/) web page should offer this. The
problem is that the page isn't kept up to date and questions about
membership go ignored by whoever is running it. They are doing a
conference next year but, looking through the page, it isn't really
clear how to join or what dues to pay for the official stuff. Beyond
that, there is no e-mail list so people working in that field or on
their degrees can communicate.

I'd set up a list but the obvious question is: why should an individual
set up such a list when there is at least two or three organizations for
academics out there working in these areas. It seems kind of silly.
