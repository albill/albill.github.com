He just started up a little personal writing project on Livejournal at <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/os_matrix/"> http://www.livejournal.com/users/os_matrix/</a>.

Typical of their strain of post-post-modern humor, referencing any phrase at hand until the senseless words writhe with their own peculiar nest of meanings. Especially since Deep Eye claims he is blind and relies on his precisely tuned psychic prescience to get around effortlessly. The sunglasses and cane just give him a harmless appearance. Even if it is true, he’s certainly someone I’d want at my back in a fight. The way I’ve seen him move I can only imagine he thought the Matrix movies a laughable understatement of what humans are capable of.<br /> <br /> Deep Eye finds it amusing that he acts as a go-between for someone who calls himself after the Roman god of thresholds; and that I honestly think a pair of sunglasses will make it any less obvious just how out there I still am. If there’s a border town between Reality and the Absurd I’m the big neon billboard announcing its city limits.<br /> <br /> "Janus," he says, grinning like a mad cat, and slides into the other chair. "Welcome back." Two drunk teenyboppers playing hookey bounce down the street, bubbling over their new shoes and fake Ids. Though he doesn’t follow them with his eyes I know Deep Eye is watching them, as well as the cop down the block about to make the last catch of his day. When he was sure no one was watching us, the Free Agent slipped a tattered envelope onto the table.<br /> <br /> "What’s that?"<br /> <br /> "An assignment."
