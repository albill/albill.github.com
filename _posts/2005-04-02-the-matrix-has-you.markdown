There is a magician with a blog that I normally follow (called "[True
Names](http://truenames.blogspot.com)"). He just started up a little
personal writing project on Livejournal at

> I find it amusing that in lineage with the Watergate Scandal’s tip-off
> Deep Throat, and Douglas Adams’ world-manufacturing super computer
> Deep Thought, my contact with the Free Agents calls himself Deep Eye.
> Typical of their strain of post-post-modern humor, referencing any
> phrase at hand until the senseless words writhe with their own
> peculiar nest of meanings. Especially since Deep Eye claims he is
> blind and relies on his precisely tuned psychic prescience to get
> around effortlessly. The sunglasses and cane just give him a harmless

>  Deep Eye finds it amusing that he acts as a go-between for someone
