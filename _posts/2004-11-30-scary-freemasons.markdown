I finally got around to getting my friend, Ken, to sign my Masonic
application. He's a member of the lodge I'm applying to and I needed him
or another member that I know to sign it as I forgot to do it when I
initially turned it in a long while back. I've mailed it in.

I expect that it will be read at the lodge this month. Sometime in early
to mid January, a group of Masons will interview me to see if I'm a
complete wingnut or not (bwa ha ha!!). Assuming that I don't start
speaking in tongues and keep it together, I'll probably undergo the
first initiation in February.

I've been interested in Masonry for a number of reasons for a long, long
time. I was once an Oddfellow, which is similar, but still not quite the
same. A lot of my esoteric interests have a certain shared history with
the Freemasons. A lot of my historical and political interests do as
well, at least for the order of yesteryear. As I know many magicians who
are also involved, I think it will be an interesting relationship.
