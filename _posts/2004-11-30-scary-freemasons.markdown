<p>I finally got around to getting my friend, Ken, to sign my Masonic 
application. He&#39;s a member of the lodge I&#39;m applying to and I needed him or 
another member that I know to sign it as I forgot to do it when I initially 
turned it in a long while back. I&#39;ve mailed it in.</p>
<p>I expect that it will be read at the lodge this month. Sometime in early to 
mid January, a group of Masons will interview me to see if I&#39;m a complete 
wingnut or not (bwa ha ha!!). Assuming that I don&#39;t start speaking in tongues 
and keep it together, I&#39;ll probably undergo the first initiation in February.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been interested in Masonry for a number of reasons for a long, long 
time. I was once an Oddfellow, which is similar, but still not quite the same. A 
lot of my esoteric interests have a certain shared history with the Freemasons. 
A lot of my historical and political interests do as well, at least for the 
order of yesteryear. As I know many magicians who are also involved, I think it 
will be an interesting relationship.</p>
