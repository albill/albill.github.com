Yesterday evening, R and I went over to see our friends Marc and Nef. They  live in a house on some acreage out in Monroe. People that recall my posts about  last May Day and burning a wicker man will know this place as they are the hosts  of that annual event.

We'd been meaning to get out there forever but the two of them are often busy  with their twins and schedules just never seemed to work out. They invited us  over for dinner recently so it seemed like a good time to go.

We arrived a little after five and were probably there for about six hours so  it was quite an evening. Good food, wine and talk. We discussed the Ordo Templi  Orientis a bit as Nef had gone down to the <a href="http://kaaba.oto-usa.org/"> Kaaba Colloquium</a> last weekend. R and I had considered going but with my  school schedule and still being behind from the trip to Thailand, I hadn't been  able to commit to it ahead of time. I got to see the handouts from it and it  sounds like it as a good leadership workshop for the order.

We spent a long time discussing the ideas around "Peak Oil" and Kunstler's<strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0871138883/">The Long Emergency</a></strong>,  which is related to that. I really do believe that many of Kunstler's arguments  are correct and have thought this way for much of the last ten years. We cannot  sustain McMansions fifty miles from cities with people commuting in SUVs back  and forth for very long. The resources don't exist and with the  industrialization of China and India, they are getting used up even more quickly  now. The real question is "What can I do about it?"

Other than reducing the impact or footprint that you have personally, it is  probably a good time to learn some essential skills that our great-grandparents  knew how to do. Can you repair normal mechanical devices? Do you know how to  tell clean water from bad? Do you have supplies so if things go haywire, even at  the level of Katrina, that you can eat and drink for a few months?

Part of Kunstler's arguments are that people will wind up contracting back  into the major urban areas where we don't have to spend resources just getting  around so much. Farming on a local level, along with machine work, industry,  etc. will probably start happening again. When shipping things around the world  becomes very very expensive, it will be good to be able to make basics locally.  Part of the quandry that I have had when thinking about a lot of this is whether  it is better or worse to be in a major urban area during the initial stages of a  time of crisis?

One argument is that if people are going to reinvest in urban areas, it is  better to be there now. Conversely, if people start freaking out and getting  desperate, being in a place with a million (or five) other people might not be  very good initially and you'd be better off being elsewhere. I know of at least  one person that moved to Ashland, Oregon probably for these sorts of reasons. It  is an urban area large enough to sustain itself but surrounded by enough space  and farmland that it won't get as crazy as, say, Los Angeles or San Francisco  might...

This was the source of much conversation. Marc is doing things locally to try  to make good connections with his neighbors and community, for a variety of  reasons. This kind of stuff makes those actions make even more sense.
