Ah, the joys of the three day weekend are not terribly sublime...

R and I went and saw X2 on Friday night since she hadn't gone with  and I a few weeks ago. I think she enjoyed it. Not a deep film by any stretch of the imagination but we went to a matin√©e (after bailing work early) and so it wasn't super-expensive.

Saturday, we bummed around the house all morning and then, in mid-afternoon, headed north to go horseback riding at a ranch that has horses for trail-rides. This is R's birthday present from me. Unfortunately, this huge storm rolled through and I nearly slid off of the freeway a few times. Hydroplaning in traffic is not cool. We called them and it had been raining up there but had mostly stopped. Envisioning another 30 miles of driving in this, we canceled to reschedule.

We came home and later went to see Covenent (an Electro-Industrial band from Sweden) at the Catwalk (aka the Catbox), a local Goth-Industrial club that most of us don't go to anymore since it is in a shitty part of town. The show was extremely loud (even for such things) but it was a good show. We were glad to get out for the evening.

Today, R is probably going to the local OTO's Gnostic Mass though I'm not sure if I'm going to go. Later, we're meeting our friend Willow at an organizational meeting for this years <a href="http://pages.tm.net/theblacksun">Black Sun Gathering</a>, happening in July. We'll probably be staff of some sort. Last year we helped Willow and her mate perform a ritual there.

Here's the blurb for it:

<strong>The Black Sun Festival * July 11-13th, 2003</strong>
find us in the virtual maze located at <a href="http://pages.tm.net/theblacksun">http://pages.tm.net/theblacksun</a>

*
<strong>What is it?:</strong>
The Black Sun gathering is a Dark Arts Festival focused on the  Counter Culture Current of the North West and beyond.
Our intent is to bring together the wyrd, dark, dramatic and bizarre elements of life, music, art, performance and culture to a location of natural habitat.

To bring forth a sense of communion with the elements and a general  state of Autonomy in which to express our art and share it with those who will appreciate it.

The gathering is a 2 to 3 day event in the woods of Washington/Oregon. Many performers, musicians, presentations
and the like will occur.

*
This year the event will be happening on the weekend of July 11, 12 and 13th, during the full moon. The event is purposefully placed on the full moon between Summer Solstice and Lughnasadh ... for those unfamiliar of Lughnasadh....

********
Lughnasadh means the funeral games of Lugh, the Irish sun god.

This funeral is not his own, but the funeral games he hosts in honor of his foster-mother Tailte. This day originally coincided with the first reapings of the harvest. It was known as the time when the plants of spring begin to die and drop their fruits or seeds for our use and to ensure future crops.

As autumn begins the Sun God begins to fade , but is not yet dead. The God symbolically loses some of his strength as the Sun rises farther in the South each day and the nights grow longer.
