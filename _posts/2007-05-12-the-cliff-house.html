R and I went out to Ocean Beach a week ago. It was her birthday and she wanted to have brunch at the Cliff House. The Cliff House is a historic landmark which has several restaurants in it. Originally, it was a resort hotel for the rich and later the home to a popular set of public baths. These were the "Sutro Baths", which later burned down from what I can tell. There was an amusement park there at well, sort of a San Francisco Coney Island.

I took a number of pictures and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157600208849372/">uploaded them</a> to my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/">Flickr</a> account. A few are below.
