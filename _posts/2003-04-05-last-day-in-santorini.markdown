Today we were going to go on a glass-bottom boat cruise out to the
volcano and the hot springs but the weather was very overcast this
morning. We went out to breakfast but it was still bad so we cancelled
that trip. As it turns out, the weather cleared up by the time the boat
would have left but since it is a cable-car trip down a cliff at the old
port, we couldn't make it in time. Instead of mopeds, we decided to rent
a car today and drive around Santorini. We got it around noon and drove
up to the tallest peak in the island (we got lost!) and realized that it
wasn't where we wanted to go. Eventually, we found the road to the ruins
of Ancient Thera, which is a Roman era site from the island. After
driving the car up about two or three miles of one car wide switchbacks,
you end at the top of a ridge. You then climb a goat trail up the side
of a mountain since these people decided to build on top of this peak
for some reason. The wind was so strong that you literally had to lean
hard into it to walk for much of the climb. It was quite a slog but
worth it. We got to see the ruins (which are fairly limited in what is
left) of the temenos of Artemis, a ptolemaic gymnasium of some sort and
a lot of other general low walls and columns. After this, we went back
down the the car and drove to the southern tip of the island on the
other side from Acrotiri. There is a nice beach town there and a tavern
there had been recommended to us for lunch. We had the best lunch of the
whole trip there (lots of garlic) while surrounded by all of the cats
that seem to live in the restaurant begging... We then drove out to Oia
and looked out over the view there. It had been recommended as the best
place to see the sunset but things have gotten hazy so we're not going
to get a clear sunset. We then came back and R has gone to take a nap
for a while before we go out to dinner and drinks tonight. Tomorrow at
2:15 pm, we'll be taking the ferry to Herakion in Crete and continuing
from there. Our three days in Santorini will be up.
