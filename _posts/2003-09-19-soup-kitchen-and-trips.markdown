I'm thinking of doing volunteer in a Soup Kitchen or similar work. I'm
specifically looking at working with the people that are abandoned by
our society in some way and this seems a good way to do it. If people
have advice, pro or con or anything, on this, I'd love to hear it. On
another note, Twightlight Gathering is cancelled now but R and I already
have our tickets for next week so we'll be going to California on
Thursday and coming back on Sunday. We're thinking of going to Santa
Cruz on Saturday to go on the Boardwalk and such.
