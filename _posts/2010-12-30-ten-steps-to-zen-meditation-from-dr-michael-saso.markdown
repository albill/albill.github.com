I'm going to "steal" from another blog here, which I generally avoid
doing, in order to draw attention to it and what it has to say. Dr.
Michael Saso has posted a synopsis version of the ten steps in shamatha
and vipassana practice according to Zhi Yi, the famous ancestor (what my
lineage of practice calls the "patriarchs") of Tendai Buddhism. I found
this an excellent enough summary that I wanted to repeat it here and
draw attention to Dr. Saso's quite enjoyable and informative, if
occasional, blog posts. [**Ten Steps to “Zen” (Samatha Vipassyana)
meditation**](http://www.michaelsaso.org/?p=1552) (Adapted from Zhi Yi’s
writings, on Mt. Tiantai, 560-580)

1.  never harm, or say bad things about anyone;
2.  Purify the five sense (ears, eyes, nose, taste, touch) of “me only”
    feelings;
3.  Purify the heart of “me only” desires, and the mind of all images;
4.  Harmonize breathing, eating, sleeping, and daily living by
    “centering;” (i.e., be focused on "Transcendent” presence within)
5.  The joy of “Stop-samatha” “Look-vipassyana” prayer is overwhelming:
6.  stop all judging; to look at others with compassion;
7.  A true spiritual path overflows with love & compassion;
8.  Discern “good,” and “bad” spirits, to heal them;
9.  True love/compassion really does heal others;
10. Follow any and all spiritual paths that teach compassion.

I wanted to add that [Kalavinka Press](http://www.kalavinka.org/) has
wonderful translations available of Zhi Yi's (Chih-i) writings in both
printed and PDF formats. They have his [The Essentials of Buddhist
Meditation](http://www.kalavinka.org/kp_book_pages/ebm_book_page.htm)
and [The Six Dharma Gates to the
Sublime](http://www.kalavinka.org/kp_book_pages/sgs_book_page.htm)
available. Both are excellent meditation manuals and well recommended to
me by my local Tendai priest (and occasional teacher), Rev. Keisho of
the [California Tendai Buddhist Monastery](http://caltendai.org/) when
he was teaching meditation locally. Zhi Yi's works have been used by
many in both China and Japan over the centuries as guides to practice.
