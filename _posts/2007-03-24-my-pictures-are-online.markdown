This is a reminder that I put a lot of pictures up on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/">Flickr</a> account.

I tend to be a crappy photographer but I make up for it in volume at times. I tend to take a lot of photos of local sights, especially if I come across anything Buddhist.

I still love this shot of the ceiling in the main stairwell at the San Francisco Asian Art Museum. The building was converted from being a rather beautiful city library.
