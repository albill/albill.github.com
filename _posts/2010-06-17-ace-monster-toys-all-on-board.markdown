Neha volunteered to be secretary on the spot (a thankless task!). We have candidates for the others though it is also possible that one of us may resign from the board to become president because, in a fit of civic theory, we made board member ineligible to be officers and then elected most of the membership willing to be in charge of things to the board. (Oops!) The reason why we need officers immediately to go with the board is that I will be filing California non-profit incorporation papers for us. These papers require us to name our board and officers, along with our by-laws. The incorporation process is quick, taking only a week or two, and will allow us to rent a space and receive donations from people. Once that is returned, we will be filing for 501(c)(3) status with the federal government. In the meantime, we are constantly looking at various potential spaces in the East Bay.
