The effort to get [Ace Monster
Toys](http://www.acemonstertoys.org/display/AMT/Home), the East Bay
Hackerspace, off the ground continues. We continue to meet on Monday
nights at 7:30 PM, often at Berkeley Coworking. This last Monday we took
another step towards becoming official by [electing our board of
directors](http://www.acemonstertoys.org/display/AMT/2010+Q3+Board+Election).
This consists of:

-   Al Billings (that is, me)
-   Christian Fernandez
-   Shannon Lee
-   Mike Gittelsohn
-   Dr. Jesus (a man of questionable virtue)

Our next task is to appoint our three officers, the president, the
secretary, and the treasurer. Neha volunteered to be secretary on the
spot (a thankless task!). We have candidates for the others though it is
also possible that one of us may resign from the board to become
president because, in a fit of civic theory, we made board member
ineligible to be officers and then elected most of the membership
willing to be in charge of things to the board. (Oops!) The reason why
we need officers immediately to go with the board is that I will be
filing California non-profit incorporation papers for us. These papers
require us to name our board and officers, along with our by-laws. The
incorporation process is quick, taking only a week or two, and will
allow us to rent a space and receive donations from people. Once that is
returned, we will be filing for 501(c)(3) status with the federal
government. In the meantime, we are constantly looking at various
potential spaces in the East Bay. You can [follow our
progress](http://www.acemonstertoys.org/display/AMT/space) on the wiki
if so inclined. We have several good candidates in Oakland and Berkeley.
Now that we have a board, I expect that our weekly Monday meetings will
transition to something a bit more fun and a bit less organizational.
We've spoken about having a visit and maybe class by the local chapter
of [Toool](http://toool.nl/), the Open Organisation Of Lockpickers, as
well as doing some electronic project instructions. I encourage anyone
interested and in the East Bay to come out to one of the [Monday
meetings](http://www.acemonstertoys.org/display/AMT/meetings).
