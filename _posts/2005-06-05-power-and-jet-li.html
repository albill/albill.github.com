R and I went and bought a new dishwasher yesterday. How's that for excitement? Then I proceeded to do some sanding and painting on part of the exterior of the house. Woo-hoo! Around 6:00 or so, the power went out. About two hours later, R came home and we decided to go out to dinner. After dinner, the power was still out so we did the unusual and went to a late movie showing. The available movie was <b>Unleashed</b> (aka "Danny the Dog") with Jet Li. I thought it was ok though not stellar. The fight scenes were well done but some of them were obviously added for no obvious plot reasons (like the underground fight club). Bob Hoskins does an excellent job as a complete bastard, probably the best performance of the movie. R commented that Jet Li should give up on pretending that he can act and stick to just kicking major ass. After <b>The One</b>, I am forced to agree. I call this the "Chuck Norris Syndrome." Take a perfectly good, even exceptional martial artist, feed him delusions of competence in acting and the idea of a "real" acting career and what do you get? You get things like <b>Walker, Texas Ranger</b>. Ouch. When we came home, the power was back on. Looks like it was out for about five hours total. Today, we are off to the annual <a href="http://www.speakeasy.org/~bwilliam/sps.html">Pagan Scholars Meeting</a> soon. That ought to be interesting. I think I've missed one of these since inception. Every now and then, I get something close to presenting but I doubt, at this point, that most pagans want to hear about comparisons between western esoteric practices and Tantric Buddhism.
