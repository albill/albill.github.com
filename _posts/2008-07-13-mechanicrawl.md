Today, R and I went out to San Francisco for the Long Now Foundation's <a href="http://www.longnow.org/mechanicrawl/">Mechanicrawl</a> event. I'm a charter member of the <a href="http://www.longnow.org">Long Now Foundation</a> so I was given free tickets to the event.

Basically, the event was an opportunity to explore a bunch of mechanical items (mostly ships) near Pier 45, visit the Long Now Museum, and head over to the <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/">Exploratorium</a>. Since we had been to the Exploratorium in the last year and the walk was already relatively lengthy, we skipped that portion of it.

We did visit the <a href="http://www.museemecaniquesf.com/">Musee Mecanique</a>, the ships at the Hyde Street Pier, the <a href="http://www.ssjeremiahobrien.org/">SS Jeremiah O'Brien</a>, a functioning Liberty ship used in World War II for D-Day, and the <a href="http://www.maritime.org/pamphome.htm">USS Pampanito</a>, a World War II submarine.

Out of these, I probably enjoyed the visit of the USS Pampanito the most, even though it was somewhat claustrophobic. We got to wander through the length of the ship and look around quite a bit.

R and I enjoyed the day out but were pretty wasted by the end of it, between the sun, the climbing on ships, and the wandering over a couple of miles of San Francisco. I have a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157606130969646/">photo set</a> of pictures up on Flickr for those that are curious to see them.
