R and I just got back from a short trip to Southern California. We went
down to Ojai, not far from Ventura, for a family wedding. R's aunt and
uncle live there and her cousins that I've seen a bit of the last few
years grew up in the area. We flew out Saturday morning relatively early
and arrived via Los Angeles. The wedding was nice to see but it was an
uneventful and quick trip overall. One amusing thing that I realized
just as we were leaving is that [Satdharma](http://www.satdharma.org),
which is a Shambhala derived Dharma center, is based in Ojai. In fact,
we had breakfast just a few blocks from their
[location](http://www.satdharma.org/OVDC.php) in town. This center was
formed by the heir to the Vajra Regent, Chogyam Trungpa's controversial
successor, and I've looked at them before because they still teach a lot
of the practices from the Shambhala Community in the manner in which
Trungpa originally taught them. I didn't realize that I had family right
there in the town. (My geography skills are pretty weak for anything
outside of the Bay Area in California still...) In the future, I expect
that we're more likely to drive there. Flying and transferring, etc. was
not really any quicker than just hopping in a car and heading down 101.
In fact, it was probably a lot more expensive and difficult since we had
to rent a car. I'm really glad that Wednesday is a holiday this week. I
haven't had a quiet week or weekend at home in a couple of weeks now and
I'm feeling pretty worn out.
