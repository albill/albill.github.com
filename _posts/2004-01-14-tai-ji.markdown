So now that Tylik has started her Tuesday night Tai Ji class, I'm taking Chen style from her. This is something that I've wanted to do for a while since it has been just about eight years now since I quit any and all martial arts after doing a Japanese style for a few years previous to that (and being fairly committed to it). Personally, I want something that I can do daily as part of my overall health routine and it would be nice if it fees into my spiritual interests. Tai Ji qualifies though I'm still drawn to aspects of the Japanese arts and the more combative arts. While I know that Tai Ji can be combative, it rarely seems to be an emphasis unless you've been doing it a while and that isn't my primary focus at this point anyway. Health is... We'll see how it goes. :-)
