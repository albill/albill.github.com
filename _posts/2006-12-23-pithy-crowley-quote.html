I found this pithy quote from ol' Uncle Aleister today:
<blockquote>I admit that my visions can never mean to other men as much as they do to me. I do not     regret this. All I ask is that my results should convince seekers after truth that there     is beyond doubt something worth while seeking, attainable by methods more or less like     mine. I do not want to father a flock, to be the fetish of fools and fanatics, or the     founder of a faith whose followers are content to echo my opinions. I want each man to cut     his own way through the jungle.</blockquote>

Makes one ponder the fruits of his labor and the work of his followers.
