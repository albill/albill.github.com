People are fucking weird sometimes and I don't always know what to make of it. I have a friend online that I've known for something like five or seven years. I'm not entirely sure. We've never met in person (he lives in Toronto) but we corresponded for years. Sometimes it was every day or two and sometimes there were gaps of many months but there has always been some kind of communication. The last time I heard from him was September 9 last year. He was mentioning some big news to me and explaining a lot of thoughts that were on his mind that he thought would be helpful to me given the problems that we had both seen in an organization that we were mutually in. It was a long, heartfelt, even loving, e-mail but I haven't heard from him since then. I wrote a response then and I've written several times since then (including a few days ago). I haven't heard anything back. Checking with one mutual friend, I heard about a family emergency but that, otherwise, my friend was fine and the mutual friend had been seeing him and communicating with him relatively often. So, he's not dead. My choices seem to be:<ol>

It was emotionally warm. To me, that doesn't make sense as a final letter if he's decided not to communicate with me. So, that leaves me justing wondering what's happened to him and whether he's really ok or whether there is some issue between us that I'm unaware of that happened somehow. I'm not losing sleep over this but it is sad. I'm pretty attached to the people that I consider friends (as opposed to many of the friendl acquaintances that I have) and I really feel their loss when things go wrong, sometimes for years. This is a person that helped spur my interest in Buddhism and he's been one of my main sources of advice in walking the difficult path between that path and being a magician. Hopefully he'll come back at some point but after sending four or five e-mails over nine months, I'm beginning to wonder. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <b>Update:</b> A mutual friend saw this who lives local to him. This friend tracked him down and told him to contact me. It turns out that he changed e-mail addresses, has been staying offline for personal reasons, and has some new passions (so to speak) so he's just not been around. He didn't realize how long it had been. Problem solved.
