Going into the state run liquor store to buy scotch, the counter lady decided it wasn&apos;t good enough to check my ID when I came to purchase. She followed me around the store for a couple of minutes and then asked to see my ID.

Since I&apos;m 31, I&apos;m not sure what to make of it. I know that I sure as shit don&apos;t look 20. ;-)
