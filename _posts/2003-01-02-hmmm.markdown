Going into the state run liquor store to buy scotch, the counter lady
decided it wasn't good enough to check my ID when I came to purchase.
She followed me around the store for a couple of minutes and then asked
to see my ID. Since I'm 31, I'm not sure what to make of it. I know that
I sure as shit don't look 20. ;-)
