One of the things that my wife got me for Yule (aka the Solstice, aka  Christmakwanzanukah) is Stephen Mitchell's new rendition (not translation) of <strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/074326164X">Gilgamesh</a></strong>. I've  had this recommended to me a number of times and I'm quite looking forward to  reading it.

This week, I've subscribed to a few more podcasts for my ipod. I'm picking up  Ken McLeod's podcasts from <strong> <a href="http://www.unfetteredmind.org/resources/audio.php">Unfettered Mind</a></strong>  now. I have his book, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062516809"> Wake Up to Your Life</a></strong>, which I quite like. Ken is recognized within the  Tibetan community as a lama and teacher of the dharma with permission to act as  such from his own teacher but has chosen to work in a consultant model when  teach people rather than a typical student teacher one. He seems to find it  works better as a American working with other Americans to approach teaching  people as you could, say, a counseling or similar professional service. It  avoids certain unfortunate dynamics. A bunch of his material just went online in  his podcasts so I've downloaded them for listening.

Speaking of people online and spirituality (loosely), what happened with the  guys over at <strong><a href="http://www.generationsit.org/">Generation Sit</a></strong>?  They used to post all of the time and it was interesting stuff. Then the quality  went downhill with the whole "Jesus & Nietzsche" series of posts and now they  hardly post at all. I've got to wonder if these guys are all burned out or  something. The blog seemed to have a lot of promise to it.
