<p>I&#8217;ve had my blog at arcanology.com for a few years now. I chose the domain name, which means &#8220;the study of mysteries&#8221;, when I was working on my Master&#8217;s degree. My work there, and my thesis, focused on Western Esotericism, specifically the view of the soul in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.</p>
<p>These days, as people no doubt notice, I tend to blog about Buddhism, my future academic work (&#8230;in Buddhism), or geek stuff such as tech or science fiction. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve owned openbuddha.* (com, net, org) for a while and haven&#8217;t been using it since my failed attempts to start a web community on the site. I also own onesangha.org, which is the failed attempt to start a group blog (I can&#8217;t even get my own teacher to write posts for it) with four or more other people. Out of these various other domains, only the recent <a href="http://community.zen-sangha.org">Zen Community</a> site is really doing well and it really does so simply by the fact that 25 bloggers are cycling posts through it.</p>
<p>Given my larger focus on Buddhism and the fact that it will continue while I do my doctoral work, I am going to move my blog over to OpenBuddha.com. I&#8217;ll have to figure out how to do the redirection of my feeds so those subscribed to the arcanology.com feeds don&#8217;t have their feeds broken. Assuming that I can do this, it should be pretty transparent as a move. I expect to get the new site up in the next week, assuming that I have time.</p>
