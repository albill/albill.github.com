I am looking through the <a href="http://www.sakya.org/vei/Spring2002/virupa.htm">Virupa Ecumenical Institute's</a> calendar and I've actually found things that I'm interested in attending. This is new for me as their events in the past seem to have mainly academic classes.

Now, I have thought of taking a class in Tibetan but I am interested in other things...

Anyway, they had the following listed:
<blockquote><strong>SHITRO EMPOWERMENT, TRANSMISSION, TEACHING, AND PRACTICE</strong>H.H. Jigdal Dagchen Sakya
Sunday, May 5
10:00 am to 5:00 pm
$50
"Shitro" refers to peaceful and wrathful deities met in the intermediate state (bardo) following death. It is also a Dzogchen practice (this version comes from Jigme Lingpa), and very helpful to people after they have died, even if it has been many years since their death.

and also:
<blockquote><strong>TIBETAN MEDICINE: EMPHASIS ON FIRE IMBALANCE AND AGGRAVATIONS CAUSED BY SUMMER</strong>
