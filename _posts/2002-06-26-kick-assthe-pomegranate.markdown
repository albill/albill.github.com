You can read the first 17 issues of the Pomegranate online now as a PDF
file [here](http://www.uscolo.edu/natrel/pom/backissues.html). For those
that don't know, this is one of the few journals of paganism that
actually has attempted to become a peer-reviewed journal and publish
academic articles on paganism by pagan scholars. I have many issues but
never wound up subscribing. I'm very happy to find it online though.
