I've spent the last few days reading much of <strong>Nichomachean Ethics</strong> by Aristotle. I'm reading the portions on ethics right now and will read the portion on politics later today. This is for a paper due on Friday (a short one).

I must say that, to my horror, Aristotle is still the most dry reading I've ever encountered. I thought age and experience would cause me to find him much more approachable but I am finding that my horrid undergraduate struggle with his text is still being repeated. This guy makes reading 400 pages of Edmund Burke seem light and fun. It's very dense stuff compared to Plato, whom I enjoyed.
