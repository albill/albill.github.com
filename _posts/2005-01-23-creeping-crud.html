I have been officially served notice by the Creeping Crud that it is moving into my residence for a while. I've been feeling a bit crappy since Friday night but I've turned the corner to <b>completely</b> crappy "gonna have a lie down now" mode.

Since I don't get sick normally at all, this does not bode well for other humans around me, in a variety of ways.
