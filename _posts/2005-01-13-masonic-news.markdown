As I mentioned the other day, I met with the Masons this last weekend to be interviewed for becoming a member. 

The lodge I am applying to, Queen Anne Lodge, is doing a lecture series. I was invited to come but wasn't able to do so (I had dinner scheduled with R). I am told it was on "Grammar (of the seven liberal arts) and a Greco-Roman Historian spoke of the subject and how it was developed in ancient Rome." Cool stuff.

Apparantly there was a business meeting held beforehand and my application was approved. So, I will be made a Mason in short order.
