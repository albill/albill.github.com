![image](http://www.arcanology.com/images/samanta.jpg)At the foot of the
Bodhi tree, beautifully seated, peaceful and smiling, the living source
of understanding and compassion, to the Buddha I go for refuge. The path
of mindful living, leading to healing, joy, and enlightenment, the way
of peace, to the Dhamma I go for refuge. The loving and supportive
community of practice, realizing harmony, awareness, and liberation, to
the Sangha I go for refuge. I am aware that the Three Gems are within my
heart. I vow to realize them. I vow to practice mindful breathing and
smiling, looking deeply into things. I vow to understand living beings
and their suffering, to cultivate compassion and loving kindness, and to
practice joy and equanimity. I vow to offer joy to one person in the
morning and to help relieve the grief of one person in the afternoon. I
vow to live simply and sanely, content with just a few possessions, and
to keep my body healthy. I vow to let go of all worry and anxiety in
order to be light and free. I am aware that I owe so much to my parents,
teachers, friends and all beings. I vow to be worthy of their trust, to
practice wholeheartedly, so that understanding and compassion will
flower, and I can help living beings be free from their suffering. May
the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha support my efforts.
