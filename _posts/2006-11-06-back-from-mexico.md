R and I are back from Mexico now. We left Cancun this morning and flew back to Oakland via Charlotte. That's a bit of a trip.

On Saturday, we stopped by Ek Balam, a recently opened ruins site, on our way from Merida to Cancun. I'll be posting photos later.

I did add photos of our visit to Uxmal on Friday to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/">Flickr</a> tonight. I've create a few <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157594362964051/">photo</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157594362993703/">sets</a> as well. Here is a sample:

Tomorrow morning, we both go back to work. The vacation is now over...
