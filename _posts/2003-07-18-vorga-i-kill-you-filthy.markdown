I picked up a copy of <b>The Stars My Destination</b> the other day. It&apos;s my favorite science fiction novel of all time. I&apos;m encouraging R to read it after she finished <b>Little, Big</b>. If you haven&apos;t read it, you should. Almost 50 years after it was written, it still stands the test of time.

I dropped out of Latin tonight. I don&apos;t feel like I can dedicate the time to it that I need to in order to be successful. That isn&apos;t literally true in that I do have the time in my schedule but, with a month off for the holidays, I&apos;ve been taking either Latin or Ancient Greek since the end of last September. I&apos;m just tired of going to language classes two nights a week after a long day at work, of having to study and do homework for a fairly difficult topic along with buying a house, getting engaged, etc. I need some time off from it.

It was also getting in the way of doing other things. R and I are either going to take yoga or start doing some martial arts together. We need to have more time together and doing things together. 

If anyone has a place for either <b>on the East side of the Lake</b> that they recommend, please e-mail me or reply here. R has no background in martial arts. I do in Japanese based arts but not more than a couple of years worth in one. My preferences are something that is actually combat effective at the end of the day but our main reason to do this is to have a physically demanding exercise as well. Aikido is likely out, as is most Tai Chi, but I&apos;m open to options.
