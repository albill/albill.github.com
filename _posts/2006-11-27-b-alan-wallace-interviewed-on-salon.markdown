B. Alan Wallace is one of my favorite Buddhist teachers who is now
working in neuroscience looking at consciousness. Salon has an interview
with him [up
today](http://www.salon.com/books/int/2006/11/27/wallace/index.html). An
excerpt is below:

> **Is that what Buddhism offers -- a rigorous methodology?** Yes. I'm
> not saying we should fuse religion with science. Rather, we should
> select very specific methodologies from Buddhism and other
> contemplative traditions where the ability to monitor the mind has
> been honed over thousands of years -- beginning with the training of
> attention and then using sophisticated methods for investigating the
> nature of the mind, feelings and the very nature of consciousness
> itself during the waking state, the [dream
> state](http://www.tricycle.com/issues/editors_pick/3693-1.html), even
> during deep sleep. Now, because of the great advances in
> transportation and communications, we have easy access to the Taoist
> tradition of China, the Sufi tradition of the Near East, the Buddhist
> tradition of Tibet and Southeast Asia. I'm convinced this would add
> much greater depth and breadth to the types of questions that are
> raised in modern cognitive science.
