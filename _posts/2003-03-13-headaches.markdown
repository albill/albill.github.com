So, I run the Web Browser test team for Windows now. Who would have thought that the headaches would be this immediate? I've probably spent about six hours a day in meetings for the last three days and the rest of the week looks the same. There are a lot of people to coral into working with us and while none of this is necessarily an immediate crisis, no one has been driving any issues for months now. It's all basically been sitting under benign neglect.

We spent a few hours today interviewing a contractor to replace one on my team that is leading soon and I got into a near-yelling match with my boss yesterday over resource allocation and the Internet Explorer Sustained Engineering test team... (These are the guys that test all of the security patches that come out for IE and they are always at least a bit understaffed in comparison to the ideal.)

I've gone from three direct reports to four plus two contractors and a whole world of partner teams. Argh...

I suppose it will get better. Of course, I received a promotion a few weeks ago (can't recall if I mentioned it), not in job but in level in my job. This has the net effect of raising my bosses expectations irregardless of me being the same person that's worked for him for the last year and a half without being promoted before now.

Luckily, I'm going on vacation to Greece in 19 days for two weeks. Counting down to anywhere but here!

Latin class is over for this term next Tuesday. Unlike the last term, there is only a two week break until the next class, not a month. I'd thought that I was very lucky and the class began the week after I got back but no...it will start when I leave town which means I'll miss the first two weeks of class. There is nothing that I can do about that though.
