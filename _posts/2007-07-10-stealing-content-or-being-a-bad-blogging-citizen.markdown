Every so often, I get trackbacks and the like from other blogs (or
"splogs" for "spam blogs") who steal content from my blog without saying
anything to me. They offer no commentary of their own, just copy my
posts. This is annoying but I get more annoyed when people hotlink to
images on my server, costing me bandwidth. As has been pointed out to me
and others before, this is a bad habit that people have... The following
is an example of what happens when you do this (this link may go
inactive soon, I suspect):

**Update:** It appears that this was done through ignorance of
netiquette on their part so I'm no longer serving up a picture of
Timothy Leary giving a...piece...of his mind instead of the diagram from
the Golden Dawn. I did remove the issue that they linked to and renamed
the local copy as I really don't want to pay for another blog, possibly
with many visitors, to host my content without asking or real credit.
