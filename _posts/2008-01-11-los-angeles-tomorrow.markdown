I'm off to Los Angeles in the morning to visit a small Buddhist temple that is down there. It is run by an acquaintance of mine whom I have never met in the flesh. LA is a bit over an hour away by plane (or a six to eight hour drive) and it is a cheap flight. It seemed to be about time that I made my way down there to see things and meet people.

I don't expect that I'll have time to meet with others while I am there but it is possible. I will be back on Sunday evening, perhaps with photos or an amusing story.
