Hal Duncan wrote a fabulous entry in response to hate mail he received
in response to an earlier entry of his deriding the whole "[Homosexual
Agenda](http://notesfromthegeekshow.blogspot.com/2005/04/homosexual-agenda.html)"
meme. The original post rocked the house as it was but [his current
response](http://notesfromthegeekshow.blogspot.com/2007/01/protocols-of-elders-of-sodom.html)
just sends me. Check out the excerpt (the hate mail is quoted in italics
at the beginning of it):

> *One of the "many inventions" confronting society today is that

Fuck, yeah! Go Hal. This is right on in a world where people still get
the shit kicked out of them for being queer. Oh, by the way, Hal is a
wonderful writer and I'm currently reading his novel,
[**Vellum**](http://www.amazon.com/Vellum-Book-Hours-Hal-Duncan/dp/0345487311/),
about angels, the universe, and shit. It's good.
