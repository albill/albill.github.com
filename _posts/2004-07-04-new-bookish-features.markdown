I've added some of the MT book-related plug-ins to the main page now. Unfortunately, none of them seem to truncate Amazon titles when you query on them. I was going to have a portion of my large wish list for Amazon listed but the title field for some entries was huge and mashed up my page formatting.

In any case, I'll probably be adding books as I read them. I expect that I'll make a large "books" page that is its own page at some point using the same plug-ins that can show everything.
