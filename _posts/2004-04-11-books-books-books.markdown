This was a bit of a book reading weekend for me.

I attended the Gnostic Mass and reading of the Third Chapter of the Book of the Law yesterday at Horizon Oasis. I wasn't having a great day nor feeling terribly social overall so I opted out of the dinner and entertainment portions of the evening. Since I was R's ride and she was attending the full festivities, I removed myself to a coffee house on the other end of Queen Anne Hill after getting some food. I then got to spend the next few hours reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0801438470/">The Secret Lore of Egypt: Its Impact on the West</a> by Erik Hornung, a well-known German scholar of Egyptian religion. I'm about two-thirds of the way through it and it is a fairly interesting text about the impact of the <strong>idea</strong> of Egypt on western culture, especially in the Renaissance and subsequent esoteric movements.

Last night I also managed to finish <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0575070641/">Stone</a> by Adam Roberts, which I had started Friday evening. I've read <strong>Salt</strong> and <strong>Polystom</strong> by him previously and I find him to be an interesting writer. I wasn't really happy with the ending of Polystom, it kind of felt like a cop-out, but I thought Stone was quite well done. He wrote the book entirely in the first person with only minor deviations away. Writing about a murderer in the first person is kind of interesting. The character was strangely sympathetic but obviously not quite right in the head. :-)

This afternoon, I finally got around to reading Charles Stross' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441010725/">Singularity Sky</a>, which has been sitting on a shelf waiting for me for eight months now. He is part of a lose group of a few authors (including Cory Doctorow) that are computer professionals of the sort you'd find on Slashdot or Kuro5hin who also write science fiction. I like his short story work quite a bit but this is the first novel of his that I've read (and the first to get widely published). I'm only on page 20 or so but it seems find. Post-posthuman, self-referential, tongue-in-cheek space opera.

Other than this, Madeline came over and spent the night Friday night, which was fairly enjoyable. She and R got to spend time painting the little teaset that R gave her for her birthday the other week. Unfortunately, she had to be back home earlier than normal so the visit felt cut a bit short.

This weeks seems relatively quiet. As far as I know, I have no required evening meetings or events the entire week until Monk's going away party next weekend. I could be forgetting something though...
