I'm pulling together all of my Burning Man gear since I'm packing out at
4:00 AM on Wednesday morning with a coworker's wife. We're taking their
van out to the playa and I hope to be there before noon. For any that
haven't left yet, I'm in the Temple of All Gods (TAG), which is camping
within the Mad Scientists Collective (MSC) at 3:00 and the Esplanade
this year. I think my load is relatively sane. I have three plastic
bins. One has food, another has cooking stuff, cleaning stuff, my
shower, odds and ends like that, and the third has my clothes and
personal belongings. In addition to these, I'll have mid-size duffle bag
with the tent and tarp inside of it, my sleeping bag and thermarest, and
three seven gallon water containers. I still need to find my old glasses
(just in case) and a few other little pieces. I hope to take it all over
for packing tomorrow night so I can just arrive Wednesday morning and we
can go directly. I'll leave you with my happiest Burning Man 2001
