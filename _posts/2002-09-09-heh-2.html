An amusing blog courtesy of : <a href="http://www.improvisation.ws/mb/showthread.php?s=b627ddf7bff53053ae23b57b2858366f&amp;threadid=4475">True Porn Clerk Stories</a>

A sample entry:<blockquote>A guy came up to the counter a few days ago and asked me if "Tae Bo" was in. 

I explained that we don&apos;t carry exercise videos and he said no, no we had it - he&apos;d seen the box downstairs. Downstairs is, of course, the porn section. 

A lot of porn movies do ape titles - "David Cop-a-Feel" was my all-time favorite - but not as many as you&apos;d think. Most follow a pattern: (A) B N, where A is the race of the participants (optional), B is the sex act or kink - sometimes this gets astonishingly specific - and N is the number of the series. Thus you get "Blow Bang 25" or "Asian All-Anal Action 15". The "Little White Chicks, Big Black Monster Dicks" (note intriguing combination of race and fetish) series has some of the most offensive cover art I&apos;ve ever seen, not because of the sexual content but because it&apos;s incredibly racist. The little white chicks look at you demurely over their shoulders while surrounded by scowling African-American men. The men are repeatedly referred to as "monsters" ("monster dicks" itself doesn&apos;t bother me because it merely implies that said dicks are monstrously large, but referring to men themselves as monsters is another story) and their faces are actually mounted on cartoon animal bodies. There&apos;s no way in hell you could put that cover on, say, a book and not get your store burnt down, and perhaps rightly so. But my well-meaning liberalism can pretty much go screw itself, as the series is cheerfully (and heavily) rented by all races.

Anyway, Tae Bo. I can&apos;t find it in the computer, but that&apos;s not unusual - deliberate misspellings are common in porn. That, plus the inevitable similarity of titles makes it a real pain in the ass to look things up. Does the customer want Black Ball, Blackball, Black Balled, Blackballed, Black Balls, Blackballs, Black Ballers, BlackBallers, Black Ballz, Blackballz, Black Ballerz, or BlackBallerz? And does he want the one in the gay section or the one in the straight section?

But I keep looking. The Zen lesson of my job is this: just because I do not want to be a video clerk doesn&apos;t mean I shouldn&apos;t be the best possible video clerk I can be. There&apos;s no way to just pop up a partial alphabetical list of titles, so you have to pick a likely starting point and then flip through entry after entry. 


"It was a weird spelling, right?" I say, still typing in variations on "Tae Bo" as fast as I can think of them.

"Yes," he says "It was spelled weird."

"Do you remember it?"

Yes, he does: T-A-B-O-O</blockquote>
