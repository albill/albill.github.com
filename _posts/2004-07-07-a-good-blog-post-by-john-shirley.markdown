We think sometimes that people in “Shangri-La” will have it, the lamas of <em>The Razor's Edge</em>, the American Indian, the Japanese. So we fantasize that we go in and <em>get</em> that meaning--we get it from them just the way we get land by moving in on it and gold by digging for it and oil by drilling for it!"</blockquote>
