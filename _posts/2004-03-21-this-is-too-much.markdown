**Yasser Arafat Says Gibson Film Not Anti-Semitic** RAMALLAH, West Bank
(Reuters) - Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
([news](http://us.rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22Yasser%0AArafat%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw)

watched Mel Gibsons's controversial "Passion of the Christ" at a private
screening on Saturday and said it was not anti-Semitic, officials said.
He watched the film -- which Jewish groups say may foment anti-Semitic
attacks -- with Palestinian Muslim and Christian leaders at his
headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah. "The president did not
feel the film was anti-Semitic," said Hanan Ashrawi, a prominent
Palestinian Christian who watched it with him on a DVD copy. Arafat's
advisor Nabil Abu Rdainah told the official Palestinian news agency WAFA
the 74-year-old former guerrilla leader had hailed the film as "moving
and historical." Jewish groups say Gibson's epic of the last 12 hours of
Jesus's life could foment anti-Semitism with its graphic depiction of
the torture and crucifixion of Jesus. German church leaders have also
said its "overly negative portrayal" of Jews risked stoking anti-Semitic
prejudice.
