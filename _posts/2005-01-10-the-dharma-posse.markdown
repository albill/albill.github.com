I believe that I've posted this before but I'm not sure. I came across
it this evening. This is me, the dharma posse and John Reynolds aka
Vajranatha. He's the guy in front. I'm third from the left. Inominandum
is the dude in the shades next to me.

Behind us is the lake that we were camped next to. We normally did our
offerings there and generally stayed close to it during the day for
teachings.

And even with the rain and my tent in a puddle, it was still the best
retreat that I've had...
