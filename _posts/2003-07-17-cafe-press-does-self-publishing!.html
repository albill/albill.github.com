I just saw this on <a href="http://boingboing.net">BoingBoing</a> today. <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/sell/books.aspx">http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/sell/books.aspx</a>. If this gets much easier, I&apos;ll have to print up my weblog and publish it or, better yet, my magical journal so I can have a copy of it in backup.
