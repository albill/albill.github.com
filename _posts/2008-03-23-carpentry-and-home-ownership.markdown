It being Easter, Jesus comes to mind today. This, of course, leads to
the topic of carpentry and woodworking for, in the model of our lord and
savior, I, too, would work with the wood... (Yes, I am still a
Buddhist...work with me here.) For a home owner, I'm not terribly handy
with tools or in the proper arts of home repair. I mean, I managed to
power saw the legs off of a table and then sand it smooth this weekend
to make a mikkyodan of the appropriate height (a kind of Buddhist altar)
but that and the proper use of screws may be the extent of my skills.
Since I'm now in the second home that I've owned, this is kind of a sad
state of affairs. I'm sure that I have as much aptitude as anyone else
but, like car mechanics, I've simply never had any wood shop training or
the like. I'd like to remedy this at some point during this next year.
It strikes me that the ability to be a bit more effective in the home
repair and general "let's nail some shit together and have it work"
areas would be somewhat useful. The thing is, I have no idea where an
adult would go to learn skills like these. If anyone has any suggestions
on doing so, I'd love to hear about it. It seems like access to
vocational skills, outside of a fairly limited set, is difficult unless
you are going for some certification in a trade. Since I don't plan on
apprenticing myself as a carpenter, there should probably be another
way. I'm hardly the first person to need to develop these skills. If
anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.
