My momma loves me. She sent me some books for my birthday (which is on
this Sunday). She sent me:

-   [Contemplative Science: Where Buddhism and Neuroscience
    Converge](http://www.amazon.com/Contemplative-Science-Buddhism-Neuroscience-Converge/dp/0231138342/)
    by [B. Alan Wallace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._Alan_Wallace).
    I'm a big fan of Wallace's books and his current work on **[The
    Shamatha
    Project](http://www.sbinstitute.com/research_Shamatha.html)** for
    the [Santa Barbara Institute for Consciousness
    Studies](http://www.sbinstitute.com/).
-   [Interworld](http://www.amazon.com/InterWorld-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0061238961/)
    by Neil Gaiman and Michael Reaves. I doubt if Gaiman needs an
    introduction to most of my readers and this the new novel that he
    co-authored.

Thanks, Mom!
