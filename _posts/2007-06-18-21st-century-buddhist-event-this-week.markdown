For those of you local in the Bay Area this week, there is an
interesting event for Buddhists in Redwood City. This teaching day
brings together a master of the Mahayana Zen tradition of Japan and an
abbot of the Theravadan tradition. How often do you get two masters of
two very different traditions together to teach? I'm in Ohio from
Wednesday through Sunday for a short retreat. If I wasn't going to be
out there, I would definitely be attending this event.

> ## [Not Two, Not Even “One” -- Non-Duality in Theravada and Zen
> Buddhism](http://www.sati.org/)
>
> ***Ajahn Amaro and Joseph Bobrow Roshi Saturday, June 23, 2007 9:00
> am-5:00 pm*** [Insight Meditation
> Center](http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/imc-directions.html)
> 1205 Hopkins Avenue, Redwood City **No Cost:** The class is offered
> freely with an opportunity to make donations to the teachers and Sati
> Center. No registration is needed. Bring lunch. This program brings
> together teachers from the Thai Forest and Zen traditions to explore
> the experience of non-duality in Buddhist practice and everyday life.
> A central foundation of all Buddhist meditation practice is the
> capacity to observe our experience clearly. As long as we remain
> observers, however, examining from the outside in, a core dimension of
> the Buddhist path eludes us. Buddhist schools have diverse
> perspectives on non-duality: overlapping, complementing, and
> sometimes, through a playful exploration of differences,
> cross-fertilizing one another. The day will consist of Dharma talks,
> meditation practice and the opportunity for dialogue and questions.
> Theravada monks eat only what is offered to them, eating their last
> daily meal before noon. You are welcome to bring food to offer on this
> day. **Ajahn Amaro** trained in Thailand with Ajahn Chah and with
> Ajahn Sumedho, at [Amaravati Buddhist
> Monastery](http://www.amaravati.org/abmnew/index.php) in England. He
> is co-abbot of [Abhayagiri Buddhist
> Monastery](http://www.abhayagiri.org/), a branch monastery of the
> forest meditation tradition, in Mendocino County. He resides there
> with a small monastic community. **Joseph Bobrow Roshi** is a Zen
> master in the Diamond Sangha (Aitken-Roshi) tradition, and the founder
> of [Deep Streams Zen Institute](http://deepstreams.org/)in San
> Francisco. He is also a psychologist whose writings explore Buddhism,
> psychotherapy, and their interplay in relieving suffering and helping
> us realize and embody our true nature. Deep Streams offers Zen
> practice; provides interdisciplinary study programs on the interplay
> of Buddhism and western psychology; and serves the community through
> programs for Iraq-era veterans and their families, and for high-risk
> youth.
