For those of you local in the Bay Area this week, there is an interesting event for Buddhists in Redwood City. This teaching day brings together a master of the Mahayana Zen tradition of Japan and an abbot of the Theravadan tradition. How often do you get two masters of two very different traditions together to teach?

I'm in Ohio from Wednesday through Sunday for a short retreat. If I wasn't going to be out there, I would definitely be attending this event.

<h2><a href="http://www.sati.org/">Not Two, Not Even “One” -- Non-Duality in Theravada and Zen Buddhism</a></h2>
<strong><em>Ajahn Amaro and Joseph Bobrow Roshi
Saturday, June 23, 2007
9:00 am-5:00 pm</em></strong>

<a href="http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/imc-directions.html">Insight Meditation Center</a>
1205 Hopkins Avenue, Redwood City

<strong>No Cost:</strong> The class is offered freely with an opportunity to make donations to the teachers and Sati Center.
No registration is needed. Bring lunch.

This program brings together teachers from the Thai Forest and Zen            traditions to explore the experience of non-duality in Buddhist practice            and everyday life. A central foundation of all Buddhist meditation practice            is the capacity to observe our experience clearly. As long as we remain            observers, however, examining from the outside in, a core dimension            of the Buddhist path eludes us. Buddhist schools have diverse perspectives            on non-duality: overlapping, complementing, and sometimes, through a            playful exploration of differences, cross-fertilizing one another.

The day will consist of Dharma talks, meditation practice and the opportunity            for dialogue and questions.

Theravada monks eat only what is offered to them, eating their last            daily meal before noon. You are welcome to bring food to offer on this            day.

<strong>Ajahn Amaro</strong> trained in Thailand with Ajahn Chah and            with Ajahn Sumedho, at <a href="http://www.amaravati.org/abmnew/index.php">Amaravati            Buddhist Monastery</a> in England. He is co-abbot of <a href="http://www.abhayagiri.org/">Abhayagiri            Buddhist Monastery</a>, a branch monastery of the forest meditation            tradition, in Mendocino County. He resides there with a small monastic            community.

<strong>Joseph Bobrow Roshi</strong> is a Zen master in the Diamond            Sangha (Aitken-Roshi) tradition, and the founder of <a href="http://deepstreams.org/">Deep            Streams Zen Institute </a>in San Francisco. He is also a psychologist            whose writings explore Buddhism, psychotherapy, and their interplay            in relieving suffering and helping us realize and embody our true nature.            Deep Streams offers Zen practice; provides interdisciplinary study programs            on the interplay of Buddhism and western psychology; and serves the            community through programs for Iraq-era veterans and their families,            and for high-risk youth.</blockquote>
