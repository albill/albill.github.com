These thoughts occurred to me as I walked by all of the offices in the hallway on my way out of work this evening...

There are two kinds of people that you can identify by the way they arrange their offices:
<ol>
	<li>The kind who arrange their office furniture and computer so they are in a ring along the outside of their office. This has the effect of having their computer face the door (and consequently, their backs as well).</li>
	<li>The kind who arrange their desks in an 'L' across the room which has the effect of facing their monitors away from the door (and leaves them watching it).</li>
</ol>
I prefer to call the first group "Welcoming Victims" and the second group "Wary Paranoids."

I'm in the second group, obviously. The idea of having my back to the door and the hallway all day just really squicks me. When I've had to work like that, it's bugged the hell out of me. People always walking up behind you, trying to sneak or just be subtle... People looking at your monitor: "What'cha doin' thar?!"

I prefer to face the door and have the knowledge that I could have a screen full of porn up and they'd never know (well, other than the reflection off of the glass behind me after sunset) along with the feeling of power of being <em>behind</em> the desk and my guest chair being on the other side of it from me... ;-)
