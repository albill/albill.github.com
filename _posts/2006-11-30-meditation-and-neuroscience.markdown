This was sent out on an e-mail list that I am on with other meditators.
This is an article published in July, 2006 on recent research.

> ## Studies of Advanced Stages of Meditation in the Tibetan Buddhist
> and Vedic Traditions. I: A Comparison of General Changes
>
> **Alex Hankey**Hethe House, Cowden Edenbridge, Kent TN8 7DZ, UK This
> article is the first of two comparing findings of studies^^of advanced
> practitioners of Tibetan Buddhist meditation in^^remote regions of the
> Himalayas, with established results on^^long-term practitioners of the
> Transcendental Meditation programs.^^Many parallel levels of
> improvement were found, in sensory acuity,^^perceptual style and
> cognitive function, indicating stabilization^^of aspects of
> attentional awareness. Together with observed^^increases in EEG
> coherence and aspects of brain function, such^^changes are consistent
> with growth towards a state of total^^brain functioning, i.e.
> development of full mental potential.^^They are usually accompanied by
> improved health parameters.^^How they may be seen to be consistent
> with growth of enlightenment^^will be the subject of a second article.

Some of the results from this have been reported earlier this year but I
