I've not blogged much here for quite a while. Years really. I lost a lot of my blogging mojo when I was sick for many months in 2008-2009 and actually came close to dying. After that, I had a long period of recovery, failed doctoral programs, and work founding hackerspaces. 

I've been less enamored with blogigng about spirituality for quite some time. Today, I changed my twitter username from [openbuddha](http://www.twitter.com/openbuddha) to [makehacklearn](http://www.twitter.com/makehacklearn). I've had a secondary blog for geek stuff at [makehacklearn.org](http://makehacklearn.org) for a while now. 

I'm going to be shifting what blogging I do to the new site and probably only posting about spirituality on [pagandharma.org](http://pagandharma.org) when so inclined. It has been a good run but I'm going to do other things and blogging about spirituality is not one of them for now. For my hackerish blogging and geeky stuff like gaming, I'll continue to post at whim to [makehacklearn.org](http://makehacklearn.org). That is my home now.
