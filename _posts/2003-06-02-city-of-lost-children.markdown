R and I watched <b>The City of Lost Children</b> tonight on the Tivo. We&apos;d both only seen it once before and it has been quite a while. It seems a fairly unique movie and I&apos;m surprised in ways. It&apos;s like a French Tim Burton movie or something. It was fun to watch though.

I spent the afternoon re-reading <b>Wicca, Paganism, and Tantra</b> by Vajranath aka John Reynolds, a noted scholar of Dzogchen, Tibetan Buddhism and Bonpo. It&apos;s a transcript of a lecture that he did in 1994 relating themes and ideas to do with witch cults and paganism in the West to similar ideas in Tantra, both Buddhist and Hindu. Quite fun as it is interesting to look at the original form of the tantric feast as being analagous to the concepts of the witches sabbat. I thought he did a good job.

I should get my mother to read it. She&apos;s a Dianic Witch and an OTO member in Salt Lake City. She was asking me the other day to explain why I&apos;d taken Refuge and my interest in Tibetan Buddhism. I&apos;m not sure that I explained it to her satisfaction. Reading things like this or like Miranda Shaw&apos;s <b>Passionate Enlightenment</b> may be of some help to her.

Back to the grind tomorrow. I told my boss on Friday during our one on one that if my work stress continues like it has over the last couple of months for the next two months, I&apos;m definitely looking for a new job (at Microsoft). There are problems to do with management and my not having enough bodies to do the job. I&apos;ve complained about this since I took over the team three months ago and I&apos;ve been told to "think creatively" about solutions and to justify why I need more people over and over again. Nothing seems to be happening though there is always a meeting or a plan to look at our staffing situation. I&apos;m not going to be set up for failure forever though.
