R and I watched **The City of Lost Children** tonight on the Tivo. We'd
both only seen it once before and it has been quite a while. It seems a
fairly unique movie and I'm surprised in ways. It's like a French Tim
Burton movie or something. It was fun to watch though. I spent the
afternoon re-reading **Wicca, Paganism, and Tantra** by Vajranath aka
John Reynolds, a noted scholar of Dzogchen, Tibetan Buddhism and Bonpo.
It's a transcript of a lecture that he did in 1994 relating themes and
ideas to do with witch cults and paganism in the West to similar ideas
in Tantra, both Buddhist and Hindu. Quite fun as it is interesting to
look at the original form of the tantric feast as being analagous to the
concepts of the witches sabbat. I thought he did a good job. I should
get my mother to read it. She's a Dianic Witch and an OTO member in Salt
Lake City. She was asking me the other day to explain why I'd taken
Refuge and my interest in Tibetan Buddhism. I'm not sure that I
explained it to her satisfaction. Reading things like this or like
Miranda Shaw's **Passionate Enlightenment** may be of some help to her.
Back to the grind tomorrow. I told my boss on Friday during our one on
one that if my work stress continues like it has over the last couple of
months for the next two months, I'm definitely looking for a new job (at
Microsoft). There are problems to do with management and my not having
enough bodies to do the job. I've complained about this since I took
over the team three months ago and I've been told to "think creatively"
about solutions and to justify why I need more people over and over
again. Nothing seems to be happening though there is always a meeting or
a plan to look at our staffing situation. I'm not going to be set up for
failure forever though.
