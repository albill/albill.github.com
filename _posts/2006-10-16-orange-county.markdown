It was actually nice to go to the wedding and I think I'm beginning to warm to some of my wife's family over time. As most know, my family is fairly small on my mother's side and I spent most of my life either living with my mother and little brother (eventually) or with my maternal grandparents with an occasional visit by an uncle or two. I'm not used to the large family thing and it makes me edgy at times. Of course, compared to the Memorial Weekend trip to Wyoming, this was a walk in the park... The wedding was tastefully done and not overbearing and held at a private country club in San Clemente. We had a nice dinner and a chance to speak with people, such as my brother-in-law, who had come up from San Diego. On Saturday, we took the opportunity to spend the entire day at Disneyland. We attended the new California Adventure park there as well as the main park. I'd never been to the new park so that was a bit different. We enjoyed the rides if not the crowds. During the course of about eleven hours, I think we hit every ride that we wanted to see except

My favorites are the older style ones where you ride in vehicles, even if they can be a bit cheesy. R had never been on the Indiana Jones ride and they had revamped the <strong>Pirates of the Carribean</strong> ride since I'd been there last (and not necessarily improved it). Because it is near Halloween, the <strong>Haunted Mansion</strong> had a <strong>Nightmare Before Christmas</strong> theme. The last time I was at Disneyland a couple of years ago for a test conference, I managed to see that but it was new to R. We got up near four in the morning on Monday morning and flew back to the Bay Area. I then went to work and arrived nearly on my normal schedule. Needless to say, it was a bit of a long day. It was good to get away for a weekend jaunt.
