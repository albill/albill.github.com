R and I attended a class on "Tantra" (really Western Neo-Tantra) last night by one of the members of her Golden Dawn group. Everyone else who had been planning on going bailed so it wound up being the two of us, the roommate of the instructor and the instructor. He did introductory material on the chakras, pranayama and basic visualization and breathing techniques for practice, karezza, and a couple of other things. He also gave a bit about where he is coming from and the tradition of practice. There will be two more classes in the coming weeks. This will give me the impetus to finally read a couple of the books on this that I've been putting off and doing some practical work. I did like the class and think it is a valuable area of practice. It's good to get a push to start doing things in a different space than normal. His own teacher runs a diaryland site up at <a href="http://tantratemple.diaryland.com">http://tantratemple.diaryland.com</a> that contains a bit more about their tradition of practice.
