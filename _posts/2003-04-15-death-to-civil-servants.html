Well, I&apos;ve been up for about 24 hours now including 14 of them on planes and about seven or so of them in airpors in addition to that. I barely know where I am.

I will say that once I exited my aircraft in Seattle, it took me an hour and a half to get out of the building. Fucking customs and security. How many times do they REALLY need to x-ray our shit?

Anyway, I&apos;m back and cranky.
