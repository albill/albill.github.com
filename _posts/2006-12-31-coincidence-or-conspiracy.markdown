I noticed something odd today while looking at the web.

I'm a former Microsoft employee but I've never gotten around to joining the <strong>Microsoft Alumni Network</strong>. That is kind of silly in a way since there are a number of benefits of being a member, not the least of which is cheap Microsoft software.

I'm also currently running Ubuntu Linux on my main PC at home so I've spent a bit of time on the <strong>Ubuntu</strong> website recently.

I noticed something odd today. Check out the logos for each site:
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/msa_logo.gif" alt="MSA Logo" title="MSA Logo" border="1" /></p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/ubuntu.jpg" alt="Ubuntu Logo" title="Ubuntu Logo" border="1" /></p>
A little scary, isn't it? Perhaps there is a plot!
