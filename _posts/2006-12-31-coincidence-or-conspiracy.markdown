I noticed something odd today while looking at the web. I'm a former
Microsoft employee but I've never gotten around to joining the
**Microsoft Alumni Network**. That is kind of silly in a way since there
are a number of benefits of being a member, not the least of which is
cheap Microsoft software. I'm also currently running Ubuntu Linux on my
main PC at home so I've spent a bit of time on the **Ubuntu** website
recently. I noticed something odd today. Check out the logos for each
site:

![Ubuntu
Logo](http://www.arcanology.com/images/ubuntu.jpg "Ubuntu Logo")

A little scary, isn't it? Perhaps there is a plot!
