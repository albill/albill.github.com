I had no idea that there was a <a href="http://www.sfswedenborgian.org/">Swedenborgian Church in San Francisco</a> (and in a famous building, at that). How interesting!

I've always been fascinated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedenborg">Swedenborg</a>, who went from being a scientist to becoming a visionary. Swedenborg's impact on the Western Esoteric tradition was quite high and elements of his thought can still be found today in various groups and traditions. I had heard, when I lived in Seattle, that there was some kind of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedenborgianism">Swedenborgian</a> church in another city nearby but few details.

It isn't my cup of tea but I'm glad they are out there.
