I'm interested in exploring the costs of cheaply printing a book. This
is part of my thoughts around a Burning Man project. The text in
question is [Dharma Dan's](http://www.interactivebuddha.com/about.html)
[**Mastering the Core Teachings of the
Buddha**](http://www.interactivebuddha.com/mctb.html). If I wanted to
give away copies of it, I'd like to print up a cheap edition to
effectively give away as part of a Buddhist camp. There are other
potential texts but this is a front runner because it focuses on core
practice in a no-nonsense way. If there was a free text that just
covered Shamatha and Vipassana to the same degree, I might do that
instead. The question is how to print up a lot of copies cheaply. I'd
prefer something bound in some way with a cover so they could be given
away for people to (hopefully) read.
