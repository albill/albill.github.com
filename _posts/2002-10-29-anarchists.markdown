heh. For a bunch of anarchists, those guys at <a href="http://www.crimethinc.com">CrimethInc.</a> have their shit together. I ordered their book <a href="http://www.crimethinc.com/days">Days of War, Nights of Love: Crimethink For Beginners</a> when I posted my last entry about them. That was 11:25 pm on Friday. I got my copy of their book and extra papers in my mail today... Now, they are only about sixty miles from here but that's pretty damn efficient for anarchists. ;-) I spent part of my evening, after buying Day of the Dead items at La Tienda leafing through the book and being pretty impressed with it. It's very well put together.
