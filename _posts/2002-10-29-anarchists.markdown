heh. For a bunch of anarchists, those guys at
[CrimethInc.](http://www.crimethinc.com) have their shit together. I
ordered their book [Days of War, Nights of Love: Crimethink For
Beginners](http://www.crimethinc.com/days) when I posted my last entry
about them. That was 11:25 pm on Friday. I got my copy of their book and
extra papers in my mail today... Now, they are only about sixty miles
from here but that's pretty damn efficient for anarchists. ;-) I spent
part of my evening, after buying Day of the Dead items at La Tienda
leafing through the book and being pretty impressed with it. It's very
well put together.
