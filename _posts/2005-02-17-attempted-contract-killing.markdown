<p><b>Current Game Score:</b></p>
<p>White Four Door Japanese Car - 1<br>
Blue-Gray Piece of Shit American Car - 0</p>
<p>For those just tuning in at home, a crew of four assassins (yes, four!) 
attempted to take out this announcer this evening. Their intended method was a 
quick lane merge directly behind my car on Lake City Way in traffic as the cars 
in front of me ground to a halt, forcing me to stop. With amazing agility and 
precision, they were able to impact the rear of my car while looking like 
complete dumbasses and making a loud &quot;boom!&quot; sound.</p>
<p>I pulled immediately over into a convenient dry cleaning store&#39;s parking lot 
and got out. The assassins, sensing an opportunity, immediately sped 50 feet 
down the road, went around the Starbucks, and veered out of sight and <i>were 
never seen again</i>.</p>
<p>The only proof of their existence is the nice piece of blue-gray plastic that 
one must assume came from the American car&#39;s front grill. Looking at my own 
car&#39;s rear, I can find no visible sign of their passage except for a dirty 
rubbery smudge. It takes amazing finesse to hit a car dead on at ten miles per 
hour or so and <b>only damage your <i>own</i> car</b>. </p>
<p>Figuring my would be killers would not be suddenly returning after waiting a 
few minutes and lacking any real description of the vehicle or contents other 
than &quot;stupid dumbfuck 20-somethings,&quot; I continued on to my coffee appointment 
with my friend, Nathan.</p>
