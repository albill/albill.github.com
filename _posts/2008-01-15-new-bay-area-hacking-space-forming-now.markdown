[![Noisebridge
Logo](http://www.arcanology.com/images/NB-logo-red-black-med.gif)](https://www.noisebridge.net/index.php/Main_Page)This
evening I attended one of the preliminary meetings for [Noise
Bridge](https://www.noisebridge.net/) in San Francisco. I had heard that
efforts were underway to create some sort of hacking space/den/lab in
the Bay Area but I thought that they were only going on in a very
preliminary way. While talking to [Jacob
Appelbaum](http://ioerror.livejournal.com/) on [Tor](http://tor.eff.org)
matters recently, he mentioned that the efforts were a bit further along
and that meetings had been happening a couple of times a month recently
to create a space. This space is Noise Bridge and it is intended to fill
the same sort of role that the hacker spaces of Europe do. As the
[wiki](https://www.noisebridge.net/index.php/Main_Page) for the group
[states](https://www.noisebridge.net/index.php/StatementOfPurpose):

This is all very much in formation and you can consider the above to be
a bit of a manifesto of the vision that people wish to see realized. The
first priority is to nail down the interests of people and to get the
word out to those that would be interested in taking part in such a
space. A number of the attendees at the meeting this evening had just
return from [24th Chaos Communication
Congress](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Main_Page) (24C3), which I
blogged about
[recently](http://www.arcanology.com/2008/01/03/24c3-and-media/). This
and similar events have inspired people, such as Jake, to think about
why we don't have similar events here in the Bay Area and also why we
don't have a space to support people interested in hacking in the older
sense of the word. Given that Silicon Valley is next door and we have
one of the highest concentrations of tech people (of all sorts) in the
world, it is surprising that it hasn't happened. This evening, there
were probably about a dozen people in attendance. [Meeting
notes](https://www.noisebridge.net/index.php/15January08MeetingNotes)
should be up soon but most of the discussion was around the idea of
finding a space to rent and then of what kind of projects people would
be interested in do. Everyone wanted to get a sense of the kinds of
things people are interested in and where we could support and inspire
each other. Jake and others discussed some of what they'd seen at 24C3
as well. Quite a few of the people there tonight are actively involved
in local non-profit organizations focused on technology or involved in
open source software in some way. In some ways, it feels like very much
the same sort of crowd that you see in the Mozilla community and other
open source projects (though with a bit of pierced and dyed hair slant).
Right now, it isn't clear that the group is far enough along to get a
space yet since that has a fairly heavy financial commitment for people.
There is an active disinterest in incorporating the group legally or
forming some sort of non-profit. No one is interested in being the
singular leader of a formal organization. Most people seemed to just
want to see how things progressed over time and have an adhocracy more
than anything else. This is a bit of a refreshing change though I do
think that the requirements around getting a space may require more
formality than this. I encourage anyone in the Bay Area interested in
Noise Bridge and the possibilities around it to [join the e-mail
list](https://www.noisebridge.net/mailman/listinfo) (or the announcement
list), [hang out on IRC](https://www.noisebridge.net/index.php/IRC), and
start attending meetings. As of this week, there are going to be weekly,
low-key, meetings on Tuesdays in an effort to keep things moving and to
get people together. These are occuring in downtown San Francisco in the
evening.
