A couple of weeks back, just before I went on the Dzogchen Retreat in
Wisconsin, I saw Lama Wangdor. Wangdor Rinpoche is a yogi, not a
scholar. Decades ago, he escaped Tibet into India. He went to one of the
famous locations associated with the historical Buddha, a lake with
caves around it, and began to sit and practice. Over time, a community
of fellow yogis developed around him and he gained quite a reputation as
a practitioner and teacher. These days, he comes over to the U.S. during
part of the year to teach a bit on Dzogchen and to raise funds for the
refugee community and his fellow practitioners. My friend Nathan and I
went out to Whidbey Island early on a Saturday and Sunday morning.
Somewhere in the middle of the island is a small retreat center built
into an octagonal cabin-type building. The upper floor is one large
octagonal room with a large cupola at the top that lets a lot of light
in. The room is bound by glass windows with murals above them at the
cardinal points. The teachings went very well. Wangdor Rinpoche gave a
commentary on the three statements of Garab Dorje, the progenitor of
Dzogchen in this world for the Nyingma sect. Nathan snapped a few photos
as well.

Lama Wangdor. I'll let you guess which is which.

In the middle of the teaching, a cell phone went off. As everyone looked
embarrassed and went through their bags, Lama Wangdor reached into his
briefcase and took a call. Everyone thought it was one of us with the
phone! Apparantly, it was a breaking situation in India.
