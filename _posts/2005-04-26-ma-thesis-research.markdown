So, I finally got access to the online library at my program. This
allows me to connect to California State University, Dominguez Hills'
online access. This, in turn, gave me access to UMI. I'm going through a
list, in reverse chronological order, of all of the MA theses approved
in the program in the last few years. There are a few interesting ones
but I'm looking for ones relevant to my interests in order to help me
find an advisor. This one popped out. I'm not sure whether to be
impressed or just perplexed.

> Title: 'The Sandman': Comics, myth and intertextuality (Neil Gaiman)
> Author: Lewis, Dylan School: CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY, DOMINGUEZ
> HILLS Date: 2004 Subject: LITERATURE, COMPARATIVE (0295); LITERATURE,
> ENGLISH (0593) Abstract: In my thesis, I examine the comic book series
> The Sandman by Neil Gaiman, in the context of modern myth building. I
> give a brief history of super hero comics and show the social dynamics
> that shape the genre. I illustrate the ways The Sandman uses past
> super heroes, historical and mythological figures in an intertextual
> interchange to create a mythological framework that accommodates and
> brings into accord earlier divergent mythic traditions. Through his
> narrative, Gaiman addresses traditionally marginalized people to
> demonstrate how people should treat each other. I also show how
> Gaiman's work reinterprets and reinscribes traditional mythology into
> a new post modern context, thereby bridging differing tradition into a
> new mythic paradigm that serves modern spiritual needs.

Compare that one with the one entitled "Drawing God into man: The
influence of Eric Voegelin's theory of modern gnosticism on Walker
Percy's novelistic vision". Hmm... **Update:** I'm looking at a
selection from this one now. A little more up my alley:

> Title: A refutation of dualism in the Christian gnostic tradition
> Author: Williamson, Neil School: CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY,
> DOMINGUEZ HILLS Date: 2004 Subject: RELIGION, PHILOSOPHY OF (0322);
> THEOLOGY (0469); RELIGION, HISTORY OF (0320) Abstract: This paper
> refutes the notion of Gnostic dualism and supports the notion of
> Gnostic monism, i.e., the Gnostic ethos concerned with the deliverance
> from error, not sin, through psycho-spiritual integration via
> epinoic/metanoic awareness. The Gnostics of the Nag Hammadi Library
> did not consider themselves heretics. However, the Church Fathers of
> the 1 st through 3rd centuries C.E. fought to eradicate the Gnostic
> notion of experienced religion, promulgating an authorized system of
> belief in its stead: extra ecclesiam nulla salvus. The potential of
> at-one-ness fragmented by Papal authority, the epinoic/metanoic
> function, inherent but latent in all human beings as an integrating,
> ground-of-being intelligence, was banished in favor of a rigidly
> hierarchal belief system. Had Valentinus, the most renowned of Gnostic
> thinkers, proved as politically adept as Clement I, Bishop of Rome,
> then Christianity perhaps would not have devolved into what Nietzsche
> contemptuously dismissed as a religion of slaves.
