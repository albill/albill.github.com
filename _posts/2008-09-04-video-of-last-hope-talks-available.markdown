The Last HOPE was a hacker convention that took place in New York City
in July, 2008. It is one of a series, over the years, sponsored by
[2600](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2600:_The_Hacker_Quarterly)
magazine. I did not attend because we had just had the Mozilla Summit
and I was already scheduled to go to the Black Hat and DEFCON
conventions in August. Several of my friends and acquaintances did go
though and at least one of them presented there. The audio of the talks
is available on the [talks](http://www.thelasthope.org/talks.php) page
on the Last HOPE [site](http://www.thelasthope.org). You can see
descriptions of the talks and listen to lower or higher fidelity
versions of the talks. Since many of them have slides or other
demonstrations, this is not always the greatest of options. I found out
yesterday that torrents have been made available of videos of most of
the talks. You can find these [here](http://hopetracker.donthax.me/) for
download. There are no descriptions so you will need to go to the talks
page on the main site above if you want information on these talks. I
appreciate that HOPE has made all of these available. The talks from the
last few [Chaos Communication
Congresses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress)
are also [available for free
online](http://chaosradio.ccc.de/24c3_m4v.html) as well. This means that
those people who don't have the resources to fly all over to attend
these hacker conferences can get some of the value that they offer,
which is a nice way of giving back to the community.
