<h2 align="center">The Spontaneous Song of the Innate</h2>
		<h3 align="center">The Supplication of Calling the Master from Afar</h3>
		<p align="center"><b>by His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Your essence, the natural state of simplicity, unchanging from the beginning,<br>
Abides as the youthful vase body, the basic luminosity of primordial 		purity.<br>
		Dharmakaya master Yeshe Dorje, think of me.<br>
		Grant your blessing that I may attain the great confidence of the view.</p>
		<p>Your nature, the luminous sphere of unobstructed unity,<br>
		Abides as the display of spontaneous presence endowed with the five 		certainties.<br>
		Sambhogakaya master Dechen Dorje, think of me.<br>
		Grant your blessing that I may perfect the great skill of meditation.</p>
		<p>Your compassion, the wakefulness free from extremes and devoid of 		partiality,<br>
		Abides as the naked essence of all-pervasive awareness and emptiness.<br>
		Nirmanakaya master Drodül Lingpa, think of 		me.<br>
		Grant your bless that I may master the great enhancement of action.</p>
		<p>There is no change in the primordial ground of self-awareness.<br>
		There is no good or bad in whatever occurs, the expression of dharmakaya.<br>
		Since my present wakefulness is the buddha in person,<br>
		I have discovered the carefree master of mental ease within my own 		heart. </p>
		<p>When realizing that the master's nature is this innate mind,<br>
		There is no need for fixated prayer or contrived exertion.<br>
		By relaxing freely in the uncontrived and natural glow of awareness,<br>
		I have obtained the blessing of nonfixation, spontaneously freeing 		whatever occurs.</p>
		<p>There is no chance for buddhahood through the way of fabrication.<br>
		The mind-made meditation of speculation is a deceptive enemy.<br>
		As a silly madman whose fixation has collapsed,<br>
		I will now spend my life unadorned, in the spontaneous state of rest.</p>
		<p>As a yogin of the Great Perfection, I am happy in whatever I do.<br>
		As a scion of Padmakara, I am joyful no matter who I am with.<br>
		As the great treasure master, my protector is unequaled.<br>
		As the heart essence of dakinis, these teachings are unmatched.</p>
		<p>The darkness of the great ignorance in my heart is spontaneously 
		cleared.<br>
		The sun of luminous wakefulness shines unobscured and continuously.<br>
		This great fortune is the kindness of my master, the only father.<br>
		I remember his kindness which is impossible to repay.</p>
		<p>At the request of my foremost vajra disciple, Tulku Jigmey Chö-ying 
		Norbu Dön Tamchey Drubpey Dey, this was 		uttered as wanton gossip by Jigdrel Yeshe Dorje.</p>
