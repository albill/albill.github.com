<p>I've added another section to my long languishing <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/gdlibrary/">Golden Dawn Library Project site</a>.  These are scans of a Whare Ra Pentagram Booklet done by the Alchemical Guild in  New Zealand something like five or six years ago. Their site is long gone and  they don't own the booklet rights in any case.</p><p>These booklets were issued to members as part of their training in the ritual work of the Golden Dawn, specifically for the 5=6 degree.&nbsp;</p> <p>I know it is a Whare Ra booklet because I have a copy of one of their  original booklets with a 0=0 (Neophyte) script. It looks exactly the same down  to the labels, handwriting, and mimeograph. They were obviously producing  regular sets internally. Mine may get used for some of my academic research but  I do plan to scan it as well since it is a primary source document to a Golden  Dawn group.</p> <p align="center"> <img width="567" vspace="3" hspace="3" height="501" border="1" src="http://www.hermetic.com/gdlibrary/pentagram/pentpage9.jpg" /></p> <p>The new pages are up at <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/gdlibrary/pentagram/"> http://www.hermetic.com/gdlibrary/pentagram/</a>. </p>
