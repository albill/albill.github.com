<strong>Background:</strong>
We are all going to die. Everyone we know is going to die. And the time of death is uncertain.
In Buddhism, helping someone to die well is one of the most important gifts we can give another person, or give ourselves. Part of a five-part (<a href="http://www.sakya.org/VEI/Spring2002/VImpermanenceSpring02.htm">Embracing Impermanence: Understanding End-of-Life Issues</a>) series which covers all of the major areas that need to be addressed in order to create more positive dying experiences for our loved ones and for ourselves.

"Shitro" refers to peaceful and wrathful deities met in the intermediate state (bardo) following death. It is also a Dzogchen practice (this version comes from Jigme Lingpa), and very helpful to people after they have died, even if it has been many years since their death.
