As some people know, in my day to day job, I work on QA on various
Firefox related projects. Mostly, I work as the QA lead for our security
releases but I have also been working on the [Mobile
Firefox](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile) (aka "Fennec") project in
between these releases. Mobile browsing has become more and more
important over the last few years as cell phones and other mobile
devices have become more powerful. It is as important for people to have
options there that support an open Internet as it is for their main
personal computers. This is especially true since so much of the world
is moving in the direction of primarily using the Internet by means of
mobile devices without the use of a desktop or laptop. Fennec has hit a
nice milestone today. As Brad [mentions on his
blog](http://blog.mozilla.com/blassey/2009/05/15/fennec-alpha-1-for-windows-mobile/),
Alpha 1 is available for Windows Mobile now. This is a big step as we've
only previously shipped versions for Nokia's Maemo platform based on
Linux. Given the installed based of Windows Mobile for cell phones, the
amount of people able to try out Fennec has gone up by a couple of
orders of magnitude. Brad gives instructions on his blog for
installation but I wanted to include Madhava's video below demonstrating
Fennec on Windows Mobile. I've been quite pleased with our switch to a
CSS-based user interface in the last two weeks. There is a lot of work
ahead but this is a big step. I also want to call out to Joel Maher and
Clint Talbert for their excellent QA work on this Alpha. They've been
working like crazy on this for a while.
