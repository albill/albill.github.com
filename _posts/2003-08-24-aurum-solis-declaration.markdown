As people may recall, the Aurum Solis became an exclusively Christian order <b>and</b> removed the charter of its North American bodies just over a year ago. As of the last month, there is now a new Grand Master for the Aurum Solis who is based in France. Osborne Philips (aka Leon) has stepped down. The new Grand Master posted a declaration in French the other week. The official English translation from him (or someone in the Aurum Solis) is available now. Of special note is the seeming lack of any mention of Christianity in the post. Is a reconcilliation with those of us in North America possible? <b>Declaration of the Grand Master</b> The golden chain of which Homer spoke is alive and active! This ancient lineage still flourishes, rich in its heritage and conscious of its role. Born from Egypto-Alexandrian Hellenism to become the heart of the Neoplatonic tradition (especially in its Syrian form), our venerable initiatory tradition is more relevant than ever. From Alexandria to Byzantium, the Ogdoadic tradition continued to enrich the experience of its members. Restructured in Florence by the Medici family, it continued until manifesting in its current form in 1897. The Order of the Aurum Solis is a remarkable initiatory tradition, having always advanced the philosophical and theurgic work of its members rather than seeking fleeting temporal power. I give homage to all the Grand Masters that have preceded me in this ancient lineage, particularly Vivian and then Leon. I thank them both once more for the quality of their immense work and for further enriching this tradition. The present transmission of the Grand Mastership was performed with total confidence according to the solemn rites of our Order. The Aurum Solis continues to build on the stones laid by its predecessors, and this living memory is the mark of the profound depth of its work.<lj-cut text="Read the rest."> The Aurum Solis carries out its work today in the same spirit that saw its birth along the shores of the Mediterranean. All those familiar with the published works of the Aurum Solis will have been struck by the rigor, the clarity and the richness of its tradition. Our tradition sits unambiguously at the heart of the Hermetic current. Traces of it appear in the <i>Corpus Hermeticum</i>, most specifically in the writings of Asklepias and Iamblichus. It was also influenced by certain aspects of Plotinian spirituality. Our path fosters this philosophical ideal, carefully harmonizing both spirit and body. As we read in the <i>Corpus Hermeticum</i> (10:9), “Virtue of the soul is knowledge, for that which is known is good and pious and already divine.” The path of the Aurum Solis entails cultivating oneself through the classical writings that constitute the roots of our tradition. This foundation establishes an inner stability that facilitates the efficacy of theurgic work. This knowledge, however, is not put forward as dogma that Companions must accept without question. The initiate of the Aurum Solis should be above all a scientist and a skeptic. It is important to learn, to watch, to experiment and to doubt. It is important to verify everything for yourself and to not accept anything directly. It may seem strange to think of an initiate as a scientist, the spiritual and theurgic techniques that we transmit and continue to develop are pieces of an entire system. They are the means to an end, and not ends in themselves. We consider theurgic work to be an inner philosophical, even a spiritual, path. This dimension of spirituality is present, but in a different form than found in monotheistic religion. The two are not incompatible, but true craftsmen (including initiates) learn to distinguish the tool from that hand that guides it. The initiate opens to an Otherness in order to elevate himself, but never subjects himself to it. The initiate always maintains a critical orientation towards mystical experiences without rejecting them. Thus he avoids any limitations imposed by dogma. Our philosophical path is similar to that described in “Book VII” of Plato’s <i>The Republic</i> and in the text of the Platonic Feast. It involves using the Socratic method; lifting oneself towards the Beautiful, the Good, the One; and the practice of virtue and knowledge. Like the prisoner in the cave, the initiate must learn to distinguish appearance from reality, shadows from the light. But unlike many other philosophical-religious groups (like the Stoics, Gnostics and Cathars), our Epicurean-based tradition does not attempt to flee the world. Rather its initiates enjoy material pleasures while finding harmony with their own natures and with the environment in which they live. Becoming fully responsible and happy in this world allows us greater freedom in our questioning and research. The Aurum Solis does not limit itself to a particular philosophical-religious path when it invokes the highest. In fact, the heart of the Ogdoadic tradition (especially the Aurum Solis) is theurgy and high magic. The published works of the Aurum Solis describe some of the foundational techniques used in the Order. However, as with all science, the practice of theurgy progresses. Since the beginning of our tradition, our masters have hypothesized that reality (both inner and outer) has hidden dimensions. Various techniques, discovered over the course of history, have led to experimentation in verifying or invalidating this hypothesis. The theory of correspondance is a good example. By the end of the 19th century, A.S. initiates had established a significant body of practical knowledge through a process of study, verification and contribution to theurgic work. The strength of an Order like ours is its ancient foundations, which have been passed on and refined from generation to generation. “We are always there” would be a good motto for us. Thus the presence of our tradition has endured throughout the ages. The continual integration of new philosophical data and discoveries have prevented our initiates from crystallizing any particular system of associations. We begin with the study and practice of Hebraic cabala, but then incorporate other systems. In this way, each initiate builds his own magical being, passing beyond the various veils of illusion before approaching, as far as is possible, “Reality.” But there are even more profound levels to the work of the Aurum Solis. Orders like the Golden Dawn have only hinted at these mysteries in their descriptions of workings such as the “Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.” According to the Hermetic tradition, the initiate is “creator of the gods.” There is a close relationship between the gods and humanity, though not in the way taught by Monotheism. This relationship is one of the most important elements of the Ogdoadic tradition. I will not speak more of this, for certain Arcanum cannot be unveiled without impunity. Thus the Order of the Aurum Solis has pursued its philosophical, spiritual and theurgic ideals, unfolding its essence from its distant birth on the banks of the Mediterranean, through its renaissance in Florence, to its public manifestation in 1897. It currently maintains these same strict requirements of its aspirants companions. Its concerns are not mercenary; it is rather our aspiration to manifest our ancient roots in a form that is relevant to the current time. The Aurum Solis, on both inner and outer levels, continues to function as a true and living manifestation of the Ogdoadic tradition. The continuity of our work and the progress of our initiates is assured. The Aurum Solis continues to transmit the ancient wisdom and mysteries of the Ogdoadic tradition. Conscious of its current responsibilities and rich in its heritage, we pursues our work, weaving a little more of the golden thread that brings it power and life.
