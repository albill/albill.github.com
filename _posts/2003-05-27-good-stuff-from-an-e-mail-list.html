This was sent to mock the original poster by another member of this e-mail list I'm on but I think it stands well on its ow n... > the bible and all religius texts of the ancient world evolved from > the pyramid texts and egyptian religion Well, actually, no, they didn't, but I can see why you would think that they did. This is a false secret, put out by the Ophidian master race to deceive people into thinking that they have discovered the truth and seeking no further. Actually, all of the religious texts of the world are derived from an Ophidian supercomputer running Enochian-based programs in the hollow center of the earth, overseen by the secret Aryan masters of Mu. No, really, it's true! But wait there's more... The Illuminati used their secret vrilloscope to read the writings, releasing one for each macrocosmic Age of Mankind as determined by the Clock of Llulu the Impeccable. This process continued until the Clock was stopped by the threat of sexual molestation (someone wanted to gangbang Llulu). Lovecraft's dreams of the Cthulhoid beings opened a portal in time for them to contact Joseph Smith, enabling him to find the Golden Tablets with the access codes for the Ophidian computer and hack out his own religious program. He has been in constant conflict with the Ophidians ever since, but the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, if translated into Bantu and spelled backwards, actually provides the stellar coordinates of Sirius according to the tables of the Taoist master Huang Lo Dong! This is the secret that thousands have died to protect, but at last I tell it to you. Do not abuse it.
