The minimal google ads on the <a href="http://www.hermetic.com">Hermetic Library</a> seem to be working. I only have a small ad on the main page for the site and one on the index page for the Crowley site. From what I can tell, the <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/">Crowley site</a> is where the revenue is coming since it gets hundreds of visits every day. I may remove the one from the main home page since the ads that come up are pretty generic. I haven't received payment yet because I hadn't set up my account but, so far, for the months of November and December (I started in November), I've received a couple of dollars more than it costs to pay the hosting service for the site. This means, for the first time ever, I'd technically not be paying any money to host the site.

Aleister Crowley, still generating revenue after all of this time...
