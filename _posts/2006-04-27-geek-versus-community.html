I'm signed up and ready to go to Mind Camp 2.0 this week. I've been pretty psyched about going to it. It is from noon on Saturday through noon on Sunday.

This last weekend, it was pointed out that this is the same day as the annual Beltane event that I normally attend. I hadn't realized this and it really sucks that it worked out this way. I still want to go to Mind Camp but I'm going to miss hanging out and burning our own wicker man this year:
