<p>The contractor spent about an hour working on the dishwasher (for a total of 
three hours here today). I shut off the water for the house and the power to 
that part of the kitchen and he got the rusted open valve under the sink shut. 
After a bit of work and some cutting of floor vinyl, we got the dishwasher 
pulled out. The motor had been the culprit, leaking onto the floor and probably 
for a couple of years (since before we bought the house). It also turns out that 
the back wall behind the dishwasher is uninsulated. Possibly the entire wall 
behind the countertops, which is an exterior wall...</p>
<p>He ripped out a bunch of the rotten plywood flooring and it doesn&#39;t like like 
the damage is structural, it&#39;s just the plywood on the surface. It fill the 
whole bay for the dishwasher and a bit on all sides.</p>
<p>So, I have two potential repair scenarios:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Have a contractor with an electric saw cut out the rotten section, make 
	sure there isn&#39;t any more damage, and then put new plywood down and then 
	seal it up. The downside of this is that the water probably leaked under the 
	cabinet next to it, which is all one piece, so I probably have some rotten 
	plywood under my sink&#39;s cabinet. This won&#39;t get any worse but can&#39;t be fixed 
	without pulling out the entire countertop and cabinet on that side of the 
	kitchen. The uninsulated wall stays that way.<br>
	<b>Total Cost</b>: Probably a day&#39;s work plus some materials.</li>
	<li>Have a contractor remove my cabinets and countertop, fix the floor 
	plywood in a much broader fashion, install new cabinets, insulate the wall, 
	and redo my vinyl floor. This sounds an awful lot like a kitchen remodel 
	(&#39;cause it is, basically).<br>
	<b>Total Cost</b>: A lot. Kitchen remodeling isn&#39;t cheap.</li>
</ol>
<p>Either way, I&#39;m not paying these guys $85 an hour to do it. I&#39;ve got a lead 
from my friend Denny on the guy who remodeled the inside of his house. If I do 
the quick fix, I might use another reference that I&#39;ve gotten. I doubt if I&#39;m 
going to pay something like $12K to remodel my kitchen this winter though. I'd have to take a loan out in order to do it.<b>
