I see that my mother's article on Nuit for <b>The Scarlet Letter</b> is available online now.

As some of you know, my mother spoke on Nuit at Notocon, the OTO national convention, last year, as well as doing a version of that presentation here in Seattle last fall. She's also written a ritual, <b>The Vespers of Nuit</b>, that a number of people and groups have begun performing from time to time over the last year or two.

Nuit is her bag and I encourage interested parties to read her article.
