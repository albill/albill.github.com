Leonardo Online, a publication of MIT, has an article on the "[Fire Art
of Burning
Man](http://leonardo.info/gallery/burningman_fire/burningman.html)" up
now. I recognize a number of the items there and almost all of them are
amazing. My particular favorite is "[The Voice of
Fire](http://leonardo.info/gallery/burningman_fire/black.html)" by Tim
Black. Tim managed to get a set of flames to act as speakes and emit
sound through a combination of chemistry and electricity.
