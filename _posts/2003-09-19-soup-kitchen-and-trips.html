I&apos;m thinking of doing volunteer in a Soup Kitchen or similar work. I&apos;m specifically looking at working with the people that are abandoned by our society in some way and this seems a good way to do it.

If people have advice, pro or con or anything, on this, I&apos;d love to hear it.

On another note, Twightlight Gathering is cancelled now but R and I already have our tickets for next week so we&apos;ll be going to California on Thursday and coming back on Sunday. We&apos;re thinking of going to Santa Cruz on Saturday to go on the Boardwalk and such.
