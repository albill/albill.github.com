So I'm visiting my shrink this morning for the first time in a month (yes, I have a shrink because I have panic attacks sometimes and I'm a stressed monkey).

I was filling him in on the last month and talking about various plans and decisions that I've been making. I'm going to go to the <a href="http://www.sealang.com/">Seattle Language Academy</a> starting in two weeks and begin taking their <a href="http://www.sealang.com/foreign_language_program/ancient_greek.html">Ancient Greek class</a> in the evenings. I've been debating going back to school and getting a Masters, possibly in Classic or Near East Studies (my interested are Neoplatonism, the Chaldean Oracles, Hellenic Egypt, the Corpus Hermeticum, etc. which doesn't fit easily in these...).

I've also been wondering about moving down to the Bay Area in a couple of years to join an Masters program at a school there. My shrink (who is also a senior University of Washington Psych professor) actually decided to give me advice spontaneously. He said, "Al, you're a brilliant guy. Don't just pick a school and go. If you want to do this, find out where the best school is, even Oxford or the like, and go to it. Do this in a big way."

Huh. Something you don't hear everyday from your shrink. So, I'm going to look at the academic authors in my fields of interest that do work that is excellent and see where they teach. Either way, I'll need to have a year or two of Ancient Greek to get into a Graduate program in my areas of interest.
