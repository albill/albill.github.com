R and I went white water rafting on Saturday on the Wenatchee River. Actually "white water" might be a misnomer as the water level was fairly low overall so there weren&apos;t as many rapids and drops as normal. 

We got up and out of the house by 10:30 am and drove 2 1/2 hours to the other side of the mountains. We then met up with people from her work (and a couple of OTO people by accident) at 1:00. From there, we drove out to the launch point and hopped into the river with four of us and a guide to a boat. The trip down the river took until around 6:00 pm. We stopped at one point to swim for a while (and this river is mountain runoff) as the water was actually fairly warm because of the lateness of the season. It was over 90 and without any cloud cover as well. Many water fights and other highjinks with other rafters on the way down the river as well.

After we got back to town, we had a BBQ with the rafting company and then did the 2 1/2 hour drive back to Seattle. We got home at nearly 10:00 pm. That&apos;s quite a long day.

Right now, my lower back is very sore (it kept me awake a bit last night) and apparantly my neck is a fair shade of pink. It was fun and we plan on going back next year earlier in the season when the water is quite a bit wilder.

Yesterday, Madeline came over and we played around the pool at home for a while, watched some cartoons and went out for food together. Other than that, it was mostly a day for unpacking and cleaning. My library room is still a disaster area. It will probably be one of the last places to be put right. Since we&apos;re having a housewarming BBQ within the next month, I&apos;ll have some impetus to take care of that though.

Today, my day began with my alarm not going off (I only overslept 13 minutes) and a 9:30 am meeting. Whee!!
