Apparently, my old team has finally released IE7 according to the [blog
that I used to
run](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/10/18/internet-explorer-7-for-windows-xp-available-now.aspx)...
Shit, this means that the next release of my product at my new job is
going to have to officially suport it! On another note, my friend and
former boss has [announced he's leaving the IE
team](http://www.scottstearns.com/archives/000820.html) as well. Quite a
few of us had worked together for roughly five years so it kind of feels
like the world has moved on for a number of us.
