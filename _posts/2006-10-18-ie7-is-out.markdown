Shit, this means that the next release of my product at my new job is going to have to officially suport it! On another note, my friend and former boss has <a href="http://www.scottstearns.com/archives/000820.html">announced he's leaving the IE team</a> as well. Quite a few of us had worked together for roughly five years so it kind of feels like the world has moved on for a number of us.
