Leonardo Online, a publication of MIT, has an article on the "<a href="http://leonardo.info/gallery/burningman_fire/burningman.html">Fire Art of Burning Man</a>" up now. I recognize a number of the items there and almost all of them are amazing.

My particular favorite is "<a href="http://leonardo.info/gallery/burningman_fire/black.html">The Voice of Fire</a>" by Tim Black. Tim managed to get a set of flames to act as speakes and emit sound through a combination of chemistry and electricity.
