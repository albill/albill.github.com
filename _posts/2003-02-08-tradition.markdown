Sometimes I wonder, as I oscillate between the draw towards Tantric Buddhism and my longer term path of Hermeticism, about how much of our own history and of our paths are a blind and a straightjacket.

When we use the symbolism, the gematria, the rituals and the cosmology that comes down through tradition, be it Hermetic, Gnostic, or Buddhist, are we locking ourselves in from possibilities or are we empowering ourselves through the richness of our traditions?

It is fairly obvious that with any esoteric tradition, one can focus on the minute details and trappings forever as a game of mental masturbation without achieving any measure of true knowledge or attainment. The memorization of obscure charts and tables, be it the bodhisattvas of all of the directions and their retinues or the entirety of 777 or the Book of Thoth gives no measure of true Knowledge. So many people, including myself, spend years working on these things when, really, they are trivia and a framework at best.

True Knowledge or Enlightenment comes from praxis and from direct realization. It doesn't come from yet another variation of the LBRP or the empty recitation of a mantra and a prayer.

I know this but I feel that I, all too often, forget it in the ways that matter. If my next twenty years on whatever path that I am on are simply going to be a repeat of the last ten over and over, I would stop now. I have a lot of head knowledge but not a lot of direct knowledge, at least in my opinion.

At times, this kind of thinking brings me into alignment with the Chaos Magicians. They throw away trapping and tradition for technique and just doing. It is unfortunate that most of them also throw our discipline or a desire for the spiritual. Whim and likes replace what may actually be the tried and true methods that others have discovered. Not everything that we don't like or that is uncomfortable won't eventually cause an awakening. So many chaotes only seem to care about sorcery and real world results, not theurgy in any real sense.

Where does this leave us? Traditions that may be straightjackets that snuff the fires of the spirit or that may be the worn paths that many people have successfully tread? The abandonment of tradition and its paths for the seeming freedoms that may not really be there...

All things on my mind, all the more so since I'm meeting a lama who is about my own age for the first time tomorrow and one that I may have the opportunity to work with in a direct manner for at least the next six months. It may be a time for decisions if he makes demands in return for teaching and if he seems, in fact, to have something to really teach.
