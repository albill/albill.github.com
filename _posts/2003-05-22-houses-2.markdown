So, two days ago, there was no one else offering on the house that we
want. Yesterday, we decided to make an offer. When we got together with
our agent in the evening, he found out that another offer was in the
works. We sweetened our offer a small amount and we're pre-approved for
the loan amount so we'll see. Our agent was supposed to submit our offer
a couple of hours ago but the seller's agent says that the seller wants
to review the offers herself. She and her agent are meeting this
evening. So, **perhaps**, later tonight we'll know if they accepted our
offer or not. We decided that we aren't going to go up much in price
though. There are plenty of houses available right now so we'll look for
another if it comes to that.
