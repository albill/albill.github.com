<strong>The Apocalypse Drinking Game</strong>
by Lore Fitzgerald Sjoberg

If the righteous ascend into heaven while the sinful remain on the Earth to face the tribulations of Satan, take a drink.

If four horsemen ride out, and the fourth rides a pale horse, and the name of that who sits on on the horse is Death, take a drink.

If the sun is blackened as a sackcloth of hair, take a drink.

If the moon becomes the color of blood, take a drink.

If the stars of heaven fall unto the earth, take a drink.

If the kings of the earth, and the great man, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man hide themselves in the dens and rocks of the mountains, take a drink.

If hail and fire mingled with blood are cast upon the earth, and a third of the trees and all the green grass is burnt up, take a drink.

If a third of the sea turns to blood, take a drink.

If a third of the sea becomes wormwood, take a drink.

If insects in the shape of horses with tails like scorpions, faces like men, hair like women, and teeth like lions arise to attack and poison humanity, take a drink.

If two hundred million horsemen on horses that breathe fire and smoke and brimstone arise and kill a third of humanity, take a drink.

If, in spite of this, people do not repent their murders, sorceries, fornication or thefts, take a drink.

If the Antichrist arrives to rule over all nations with a rod of iron, take a drink.

If you are required to take the mark of the Antichrist on your right hand or forehead in order to buy and sell, take a drink (two drinks if the mark is the number six hundred threescore and six).

If angels cause those who have the mark to become covered with sores, and turn the seas and fresh water to blood, and burn humanity with fire, take a drink.

If a great earthquake destroys all the mountains and islands on the Earth, take a drink.

If Christ returns and does battle with the Antichrist at Armageddon, binds him up and casts him into the bottomless pit, raises the faithful from the dead, rules the planet in peace and harmony for a thousand years, then welcomes the righteous into heaven and casts the souls of the wicked into a pit of fire to burn for all eternity, finish the bottle.
