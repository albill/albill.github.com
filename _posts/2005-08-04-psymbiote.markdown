Following up my post on the Zen Stone from yesterday. This is an extreme
in the opposite direction.

**a cyborg performance persona****by [isa
gordon](http://isa.sensoryengineering.net/)\
****in collaboration with [Jesse Jarrell](http://jessejarrell.com/) &
[DEvan Brown](http://devan.sensoryengineering.net)**

**funded in part by an [Institute for Studies in the
Arts](http://isa.asu.edu/) artist fellowship**

Adorned in titanium, latex, silicone, and electronic apparatus,
isa/Psymbiote places herself in the eye of the storm: the conceptual
terrain at the collision of bodies and machines, the mutation of her own
identity through transformation of the body. Ultimately the project
seeks to fully transform the artist into a seductively organic yet
entirely unfamiliar hybrid organism, a human/machine chimera with fully
integrated control systems. The costume is being animated with movement,
sound, and light; activated by manual triggers, automatic body
processes, and remote control. As her evolution progresses, Psymbiote
appears in public spaces to stimulate dialogue regarding the future of
technological enhancements to the human body. She has already been
sighted at a number of universities, art shows, international
conferences, and as host of the SIGGRAPH CyberFashion Show. The
Psymbiote Project brings issues raised by the ongoing redefinition of
our bodies into a public forum, highlighting some of the contemporary
critical discourse surrounding cyborgs and all forms of human/technology
integration.
