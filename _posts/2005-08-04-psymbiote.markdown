<p>Following up my post on the Zen Stone from yesterday. This is an extreme in 
the opposite direction.</p>

by <a href="http://isa.sensoryengineering.net/">isa gordon</a><br>
</strong><strong>in collaboration with <a href="http://jessejarrell.com/">Jesse 
Jarrell</a> &amp; <a href="http://devan.sensoryengineering.net">DEvan Brown</a></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>funded in part by an <a href="http://isa.asu.edu/">
Institute for Studies in the Arts</a> artist fellowship</strong></p>
<p>Adorned in titanium, latex, silicone, and electronic apparatus, isa/Psymbiote 
places herself in the eye of the storm: the conceptual terrain at the collision 
of bodies and machines, the mutation of her own identity through transformation 
of the body. Ultimately the project seeks to fully transform the artist into a 
seductively organic yet entirely unfamiliar hybrid organism, a human/machine 
chimera with fully integrated control systems. The costume is being animated 
with movement, sound, and light; activated by manual triggers, automatic body 
processes, and remote control. As her evolution progresses, Psymbiote appears in 
public spaces to stimulate dialogue regarding the future of technological 
enhancements to the human body. She has already been sighted at a number of 
universities, art shows, international conferences, and as host of the SIGGRAPH 
CyberFashion Show. The Psymbiote Project brings issues raised by the ongoing 
redefinition of our bodies into a public forum, highlighting some of the 
contemporary critical discourse surrounding cyborgs and all forms of 
human/technology integration. </p>
