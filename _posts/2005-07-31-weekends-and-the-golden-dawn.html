On Thursday, after all day management training at work, I went shooting with my friend, Tim, at the local gun range. He has a Glock 19 and I've been considering picking one up. It's a pretty solid 9mm. He suggested that we go shoot his so I could get a feel for it. The net result is that I realized that I really need to get a left-handed model (I'm left-handed) or an ambidextrous pistol so R can shoot it easily as well. Shooting right handed pistols always gets old quickly.

This was the final form of the Work of Earth, some discussion about how it works (or doesn't) and then some discussion of the Work of Air. I jokingly referred to it as the Taoist Golden Dawn but I know that Richard's ideas flow from two key sources (followed by his own powers of insight):
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </p>

This followed by heavy working of the material. (He did quite a bit of this when a lot of other material wasn't available.)

Rather, from the perspective that he's gained through both close study and heavy work in a non-Western tradition, he's noticed things that many people either seem to miss, gloss over or find unimportant. I really wished I'd taped the discussion that he had with us because, as always, it is a lot to take in.

This is one of the oldest of the local Thai restaurants and is quite good. After this, we went and saw <b>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</b>. We both <b><i>loved</i></b> it. It was fun, endearing, and occasionally a bit disturbing (looking at it as a children's movie). We laughed uncontrollably during the various songs (not to mention the squirrels!).

R hadn't heard about this one and I didn't know what to expect. It was very amusing in a Chinese sort of way. I especially liked the spontaneous singing and dancing amongst the citizens.

Beyond that, I am reading <b>The Craft of Research</b> to try to figure out my thesis work. I'd be outside mowing and such but I think I'll wait until twilight to do it. It's too damn hot.
