I&apos;m turning into a movie curmudgeon. R and I went to see <b>28 Days Later</b> on Friday in Redmond. During the movie, a literal fistfight nearly broke out (with shoving and such) after the girl behind us wouldn&apos;t shut up and kept texting people on her cellphone. (I wasn&apos;t involved in this beyond telling her to shut up.) She and her boyfriend eventually left and the movie was much better after that...

I highly recommend the movie, by the way. I enjoyed it quite a bit. As one of my co-workers said, it isn&apos;t really a zombie movie as much as a movie about putting people in the worst possible situations and seeing how they deal (or not) with it. What would you do if you woke up one day and civilization had fallen completely apart?

Yesterday was Home Depot day. I went and spent hundreds of dollars (from savings) on a new electric lawn mower. We had no lawn mower and the old owners of this casa hadn&apos;t bothered to mow for a few weeks beforehand so it had gotten to the point where once the cats hit the yard, we couldn&apos;t find them anymore. We also bought a medicine cabinet to put in the master bedroom&apos;s bathroom (which has no mirror since the old owners took it) and various nick-nacks.

Since I was in a money spending mood and my computer is getting a bit creaky, I decided to bite the bullet and build a new machine as well. I bought an "ICE-Cube" shuttle case (which is mostly made out of pexiglass) with an 845 chipset motherboard in it, a P4 2.8 Ghz processer, and 512 MB of RAM (the last was amazingly cheap). I pulled my big ass hard drive out of the old box, the CD Burner and popped in a new Radeon 9600 128 MB video card and then reinstalled Windows XP. The system just smokes and I can actually keep it on top of my desk now. I&apos;m giving most of my old system to someone (after adding one or two things), probably my daughter, and my old Geforce 4 TI video card to a friend.

I&apos;m now pretty damn broke but oh well!

Last night, R and I met and had dinner with "gypsydragon" who is visiting from Texas. She may be taking a position with the Borg up here in the next few weeks. She knows a bunch of the Austin OTO crowd and is a longterm member of the order. She&apos;d never been to Seattle before so we wound up going to a fairly decent restaurant and then hung out at her expensed hotel in the jacuzzi. I&apos;m hoping that she moves up here but this area may be a bit of a shock for a Texan.

Today, Madeline visited for a while and we&apos;re going to watch <b>Gangs of New York</b> this evening. It also turns out that Third Place Books is having a "40% off used books" sale so I picked up a few things like some sci-fi, Cicero&apos;s political speeches and a book on the early English colonies of North America.

I feel like I haven&apos;t had a lot of time to just quietly sit and read this weekend though. Next weekend isn&apos;t going to be much better. Lama Wangdor is coming to town and I&apos;m going to go to Whidby Island for the early afternoon next Saturday and Sunday for his Direct Mind Introduction teachings. I&apos;m told he&apos;s pretty incredible and he&apos;s the only lama I hear mentioned in the same breath as Namkhai Norbu so I&apos;m looking forward to it.
