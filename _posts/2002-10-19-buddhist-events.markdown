***Acharya Lama Gursam* A brief biography** At the age of six, Lama
Gursam entered Drikung Kagyu Monastery in Tso Pema, India, where he
completed his basic education and studied Buddhist philosophy, practice,
ritual and conduct. In 1981 he began his college education at the
Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies (University) in Sarnath,
Varnasi, India. He earned his Bachelor's degree in 1988 in the Sanskrit,
Hindi, Tibetan and English languages and in Buddhist philosophy.
Pursuing graduate study at the University, he was President of the
student union, and served two years as a Kagyu Committee member. In 1990
he received his Master's degree in advanced Buddhist philosophy. Upon
graduation he also received a special award from His Holiness the Dalai
Lama. After graduation, Lama Gursam was requested by His Holiness
Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche to come to the Drikung Kagyu Institute in
Dehra Dun, India. There he served as a volunteer for five years,
teaching Tibetan language and Buddhist philosophy and history. He also
held the posts of Instructor, Head of Examinations and Assistant
Director while serving as secretary to His Holiness Kyabgon Chetsang
Rinpoche, the head of the Drikung Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism.
During this time, he also did a one-year meditation retreat and received
Dzogchen teachings and empowerments from Khenchen Thupten Rinpoche and
other lamas of the Nyingma lineage. He also studied with Dr. Pema
Gyaltsen, a specialist in the Tibetan language. In 1995, His Holiness
Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche sent Lama Gursam to the United States, where
he taught Buddhist philosophy for five years. Then Lama Gursam met His
Eminence Garchen Rinpoche, whom he considers to be the second Milarepa.
Under H.E. Garchen Rinpoche's guidance, together with the Venerable
Traga Rinpoche, in 2002 he completed a traditional three-year retreat in
the United States, practicing Mahamudra and the Six Yogas of Naropa.
