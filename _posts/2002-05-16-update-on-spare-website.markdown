![image](http://www.arcanology.com/images/ars-stele.jpg)So, I stayed at
work late for the free pizza... I have a fast Internet connection and I
was going to do website work tonight anyway. I just added a bunch of new
stuff to my [Austin Osman Spare](http://www.hermetic.com/spare) website,
including the [The Zoetic Grimoire of
Zos](http://www.hermetic.com/spare/grimoire_of_zos.html) from the recent
**Zos Speaks** book that I own. Someone else had typed it all in. [The
Logomachy of Zos](http://www.hermetic.com/spare/logomachy.html) is
excellent as well though there are a couple of images missing from the
page I found with it. Since I own the book, I'll try to scan them later.
I have many of his images as well but I haven't created a page to link
them all yet so they aren't on the site. I should go home and read a
book or something else away from the computer though. I'm a big Spare
fan though I don't talk about it much. ;-)
