I just added a bunch of new stuff to my <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/spare">Austin Osman Spare</a> website, including the <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/spare/grimoire_of_zos.html">The Zoetic Grimoire of Zos</a> from the recent <strong>Zos Speaks</strong> book that I own. Someone else had typed it all in. <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/spare/logomachy.html">The Logomachy of Zos</a> is excellent as well though there are a couple of images missing from the page I found with it. Since I own the book, I'll try to scan them later.

I have many of his images as well but I haven't created a page to link them all yet so they aren't on the site. I should go home and read a book or something else away from the computer though.

I'm a big Spare fan though I don't talk about it much. ;-)
