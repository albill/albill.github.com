While looking at mini-itx motherboards, I came upon the [Janus
Project](http://www.tgdaily.com/2006/08/30/defcon2006_janus_project/). I
thought about something similar at one point (setting up and leaving a
wireless honeypot in a place like Third Place Books near Seattle) but
these guys did it and then some. Makes my little geek propeller spin.
