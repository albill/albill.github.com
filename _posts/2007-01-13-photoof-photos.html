As noted at the <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/laughing-squid-decade-2-photoboof-photos/">Laughing Squid blog</a> today, the pictures from the <a href="http://photoboof.com/">Photoboof</a> at the Laughing Squid: Decade 2 party are <a href="http://photoboof.com/thephotoboof/squid06/">finally up</a>.

The Photoboof is a rather ingenious vehicle (in many senses) for getting people to misbehave and have fun. I wish that I'd thought of it first!

I've uploaded a few to my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/">Flickr account</a> since R and I, as well as a couple of friends and acquaintances, are in them. I include the one with the two of us below.
