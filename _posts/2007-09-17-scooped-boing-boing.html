The German Tor operator who was harassed by the cops because of Tor activities is finally being noticed by others.

I'm glad to see that I actually managed to scoop Boing Boing for once. I guess I should have submitted <a href="http://www.arcanology.com/2007/09/15/it-can-be-dangerous-to-run-tor/">my post of the other day</a> to them when I wrote it. :-)

See the Boing Boing post <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/157425075/tor-anonymity-server.html">here</a>.
