I still own the domain but memoria.com is no more. I just set up the mail server to discard all mail going to any address at memoria.com. E-mail to my old address of memoria@memoria.com will get a reminder that I&apos;m at eightwinds.org but it doesn&apos;t give my new address of boreas@eightwinds.org.

The hundreds of spam messages that I won&apos;t have to deal with will make it all worthwhile.

On another note, I set up a <a href="http://www.pmichaud.com/wiki/PmWiki/PmWiki">PmWiki</a> on Ogdoadic.com as an experiment. I won&apos;t link to it yet but if I can get the group management to it, I may move much of my sites over to it.
