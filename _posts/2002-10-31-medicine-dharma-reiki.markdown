Does anyone know anything about "Medicine Dharma Reiki" aka "Men Chhos
Rei Kei"? See
[http://www.medicinedharmareiki.com](http://www.medicinedharmareiki.com)
or [Introduction to Men Chhos
Reiki](http://www.healing-touch.co.uk/pa-mcrk.htm). The "tm" on
everything kind of turns me off but these are the people sponsoring the
White Manjushri Empowerment and the Amitayus Empowerment in the next two
weeks. They are associated with Acharya Lama Gursam.
