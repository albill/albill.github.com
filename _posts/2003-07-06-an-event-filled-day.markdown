Today was rather event filled, to say the least.

I got up late (sleeping in being the vice of vacations) and wandered down Solano Avenue in Berkeley to get breakfast, coffee and many used books. I&apos;ve read two novels while here and am almost done with the Ken Wilbur book, <b>A Theory of Everthing</b>, so I picked up one of the new hardcover volumes of his recent work (Sex, Ecology and the Spirit and Spectrum of Consciousness), a copy of the recent translation of Marcus Aurelius&apos; <b>Meditations</b>, and <b>Dharma Punx</b>, a memoir by Noah Levine on how he rescued his hellish life and became committed to teaching the dharma to other fucked up people. ;-)

In the afternoon, we had the engagement party with R&apos;s family. That was everything one ever hopes for (or dreads) in compulsory family events. It wasn&apos;t unpleasent but family events and obligations of this sort always make me uncomfortable. I just want to be left alone and revert to sullet 16 year old self.

After this, I received e-mail with directions from my friend, Joseph Max, and R and I went to Tim Maroney&apos;s wake in Berkeley. We gave our best to Kat, as much as one can in these difficult circumstances, and sat with others eating and drinking and reminiscing about Tim and his life. I miss Tim and I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll wonder about all of the things we never had a chance to talk about since we finally became friends. I&apos;m glad, at least, that he and I made our peace a few years ago and were able to grow into some kind of friendship. Tim was a good guy and while I didn&apos;t agree with much of what he said, I very much valued him saying it and shaking the tree a bit.

Damn. That&apos;s probably enough for now.
