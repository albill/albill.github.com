We shipped [Firefox 4](http://www.mozilla.com/) today at Mozilla, where
I work. This is a big deal for us and for the open web as well. (Go
download it!) Following the friendly tradition, the Internet Explorer
team just sent us a fine cake, as they have on previous releases:

When [we received one for Firefox
3](http://www.openbuddha.com/2008/06/17/ie-sends-mozilla-a-new-cake-for-firefox-3/),
it was about a year after I started working here. By coincidence, I
happened to answer the door so I was the one to receive it that time and
a former Internet Explorer coworker of mine, Sean, dropped it off, which
was amusing. You can see the Firefox 3 cake (with me):

Then there is the [old Firefox 2
cake](http://fredericiana.com/2006/10/24/from-redmond-with-love/) to
compare it against:

I haven't tried the one we got today yet but I'm looking forward to it.
