[Mitch Altman](http://twitter.com/maltman23), one of the founders of the
Noisebridge hackerspace in San Francisco, has been working with people
on the "Take on the Machine" challenge. This is a contest between five
different hackerspaces to come up with the best repurposing (and
rebuilding) of some common object for a new use. Each of the spaces
involved as given three weeks and a $3,000 budget to do this and the
whole thing was filmed and is being run as a weekly webisode series. The
first episode just went up. You can watch it
[here](http://www.vimby.com/video/sponsor/us/all/detail/10908) or I've
embedded it below for those reading this locally on my blog.

This ought to be a fun bit to watch as it progresses.
