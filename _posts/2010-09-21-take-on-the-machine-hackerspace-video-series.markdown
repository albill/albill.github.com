<a href="http://twitter.com/maltman23">Mitch Altman</a>, one of the founders of the Noisebridge hackerspace in San Francisco, has been working with people on the "Take on the Machine" challenge. This is a contest between five different hackerspaces to come up with the best repurposing (and rebuilding) of some common object for a new use. Each of the spaces involved as given three weeks and a $3,000 budget to do this and the whole thing was filmed and is being run as a weekly webisode series. 

The first episode just went up. You can watch it <a href="http://www.vimby.com/video/sponsor/us/all/detail/10908">here</a> or I've embedded it below for those reading this locally on my blog.

This ought to be a fun bit to watch as it progresses.
