I haven&apos;t written much the last couple of weeks. It&apos;s been so busy at work that I just ignore LJ for the most part and after work, I just want to do something besides the computer. 

My mother&apos;s Vespers ritual went well with the local OTO on Sunday. It was performed following mass and was a fairly meditative rite. It involved a lot of call and response between the lector and the congregation with a large part of it done in a simple plainchant. I think that this worked well and it is different than the ritual work that most people normally see around here.

R, mom, and I went out to dinner at the Bengal Tiger, a nice Indian place, following the rite and then I took her to my grandparents. Yesterday morning, she flew back to Salt Lake. It was good to have her visiting and she and I were able to have a three hour or so chat late Saturday night about the nature of ritual work, practice and the roles of people in their own development. A lot of things that are similar in our outlooks are things that, in herself, she had attributed to her specific religious upbringing within Protestant Christianity and her reactions to that upbringing. Since my upbringing was in a fairly liberal form of Catholicism (by her) and then my own teenage involvement in paganism, it&apos;s hard to say now how much of such things are more based on the nature of our personalities. She and I feel very much the same or close on a number of issues with no reason why (though she is my mother after all).

I&apos;m almost finished with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060008946/">Dharma Punx</a> finally. I picked this up a few months ago when R and I visited her parents in Berkeley, read about a third of it in a sitting and hadn&apos;t gotten around to finishing it. It&apos;s a fairly interesting book about someone&apos;s turn around of their life. Not for everyone but I&apos;ve enjoyed it.

This Friday is <lj user="gasbari">&apos;s Halloween party and the next day I head to McNeil Island Prison with <lj user="m7o7n7k"> for the prisoners&apos; Samhain feast. This will be my first time and I&apos;m not sure what to make of all of it. We&apos;ll see...
