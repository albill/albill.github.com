I have, apparently in insanity, agreed to go sky diving with my wife.

We decided that in lieu of perfectly good Christmas/Solstice gifts, we would give each other the gift of sky diving. Luckily the life insurance is current.

This is what happens when you reach your mid-30s, I guess. You start jumping out of airplanes for "fun."
