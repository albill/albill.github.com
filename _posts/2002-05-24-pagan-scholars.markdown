So, I went to Ted and lecture on <strong>Getting Closer to the Gods</strong> or <em>Using the "Temple/Research Feedback Loop" to establish contact and enhance relationships with Deific forces</em> this evening. This was a good hour and half or so lecture. It was quite good and I wish that what Ted and Brandy said there (and, yes, Brandy, you did speak a bit!) was more circulated. I think the two of them need to write up a lot of this thought and either get it published or publish it on the web. I know a number of people that use this method of research either explicitly or implicitly. It was mentioned again this evening so I figured that I'd give a pointer to Brandy's old paper for the Pagan Scholar group here in Seattle: <a href="http://www.speakeasy.org/~bwilliam/scholars.html">On Pagan Speakers: The State of Pagan Scholarship</a>. This was given back in 1997 at what I think was the first pagan scholars meeting. It's hard to believe that it's been almost five years. (I've had a divorce and some long and interesting changes since that year...) The Seattle Pagan Scholars e-mail list is available <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/seattlepaganscholars/">here</a> and the home page for the group is <a href="http://www.speakeasy.org/~bwilliam/sps.html">here</a>. My Horoscope from Free Will Astrology: <blockquote>
    <strong><em>LEO (July 23-Aug 22)</em></strong><em>Week of May 23, 2002</em> Have you heard of Johannes Jensen, Salvatore Quasimodo, Roger Martin Du Gard, or Frans Eemil Sillanpaa? It's doubtful. I'll tell you what they have in common: They all won the Nobel Prize for Literature, but their books are out of print and hard to find. Let this be your starting point in the coming week as you evaluate what you're truly worth. Here are some other questions to ponder. Do you really need to be acknowledged for your greatness in order to feel successful? Do others' opinions count for more than your own when you measure your value? Are you more eager to gain the approval of so-called "important people" than of the folks whose lives are entwined with yours? Is fame worth squat?
  </blockquote> Woo hoo!
