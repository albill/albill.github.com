So, I went to Ted and lecture on **Getting Closer to the Gods** or
*Using the "Temple/Research Feedback Loop" to establish contact and
enhance relationships with Deific forces* this evening. This was a good
hour and half or so lecture. It was quite good and I wish that what Ted
and Brandy said there (and, yes, Brandy, you did speak a bit!) was more
circulated. I think the two of them need to write up a lot of this
thought and either get it published or publish it on the web. I know a
number of people that use this method of research either explicitly or
implicitly. It was mentioned again this evening so I figured that I'd
give a pointer to Brandy's old paper for the Pagan Scholar group here in
Seattle: [On Pagan Speakers: The State of Pagan
Scholarship](http://www.speakeasy.org/~bwilliam/scholars.html). This was
given back in 1997 at what I think was the first pagan scholars meeting.
It's hard to believe that it's been almost five years. (I've had a
divorce and some long and interesting changes since that year...) The
Seattle Pagan Scholars e-mail list is available
[here](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/seattlepaganscholars/) and the home
page for the group is
[here](http://www.speakeasy.org/~bwilliam/sps.html). My Horoscope from
Free Will Astrology:

> ***LEO (July 23-Aug 22)****Week of May 23, 2002* Have you heard of
> Johannes Jensen, Salvatore Quasimodo, Roger Martin Du Gard, or Frans
> Eemil Sillanpaa? It's doubtful. I'll tell you what they have in
> common: They all won the Nobel Prize for Literature, but their books
> are out of print and hard to find. Let this be your starting point in
> the coming week as you evaluate what you're truly worth. Here are some
> other questions to ponder. Do you really need to be acknowledged for
> your greatness in order to feel successful? Do others' opinions count
> for more than your own when you measure your value? Are you more eager
> to gain the approval of so-called "important people" than of the folks
> whose lives are entwined with yours? Is fame worth squat?

Woo hoo!
