<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/2512689903/" title="Cory Doctorow Reading at Cody's Books - 3 by albill, on Flickr"><img align="right" hspace="10" border="1" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3180/2512689903_f489112690_m.jpg" width="238" height="240" alt="Cory Doctorow Reading at Cody's Books - 3" /></a> This evening, I went to <a href="http://codysbooks.com/">Cody's Books</a> in Berkeley and attended a reading of "<a href="http://craphound.com/littlebrother/">Little Brother</a>" by Cory Doctorow, which was preceded and followed by a question and answer session.

This was part of Cory's book tour to promote "Little Brother" so it combined the spoken portion with a book signing session (which I actually skipped). He opened with a brief question and answer bit while people were getting settled, read most of a chapter from the book, and then took some more questions at the end. The chapter was actually the same one that I had heard him read before and I expect that it is one of his favorites to read (though I didn't ask).

Since I've read the book and heard that chapter before, I was more interested in the question and answer portion, which had some interesting bits.

Rather than summarizing it, I'll present you with a recording of the evening. With the permission of both Cory and Cody's Books, I recorded the entire thing. I've uploaded it to the <a href="http://www.archive.org">Internet Archive</a> under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike</a> license. The Internet Archive page for it is available <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/Doctorow_Little_Brother_Reading_at_Codys_Books">here</a> with multiple file sizes and formats. I've also embedded it below for readers here on my blog or reading my feed.

(<em><strong>Note:</strong> Strangely, the IA player has a stutter with the 256Kbps file so if you listen there, listen directly to the .mp3 files without using their player or use a smaller file.</em>)
