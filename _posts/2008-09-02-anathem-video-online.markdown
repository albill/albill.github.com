I found a video this morning that is a trailer for Neal Stepheson's

I believe it was officially produced and the scenes in it reflect those in the novel. I mention it here because it is interesting but also because you can hear pieces of three or so of the songs that I have <a href="http://www.arcanology.com/2008/06/24/anathem-and-music/">mentioned before</a> in the background. <div align="center">

Neal Stephenson will be there and they will be performing some of the music as well. It should be a lot of fun.
