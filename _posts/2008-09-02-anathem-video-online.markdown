I found a video this morning that is a trailer for Neal Stepheson's
**[Anathem](http://www.amazon.com/Anathem-Neal-Stephenson/dp/0061474096/)**
(which I reviewed
[here](http://www.arcanology.com/2008/08/21/neal-stephensons-anathem-reviewed/)).
I believe it was officially produced and the scenes in it reflect those
in the novel. I mention it here because it is interesting but also
because you can hear pieces of three or so of the songs that I have
[mentioned
before](http://www.arcanology.com/2008/06/24/anathem-and-music/) in the
background.
[The World of
Anathem](http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&videoid=41718483)\
I am going to the [San Francisco release
party](http://www.longnow.org/anathem/) that the Long Now Foundation is
hosting next Tuesday, which is the same day that the book comes out.
Neal Stephenson will be there and they will be performing some of the
music as well. It should be a lot of fun.
