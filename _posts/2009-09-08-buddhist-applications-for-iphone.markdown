Some of us in my sangha have discussed having Buddhist applications for
the iPhone (or iPod Touch). It would be convenient to have our daily
service, and the various sutras that we use in it, available easily.
Since none of us program in Objective C, it isn't a project that has
gotten very far. (I'm actually partial to the "Monastic Office" book
with the rubberized cover that Shasta Abbey put out back in the day as a
useful format for carrying around as well.) I see that within a Tibetan
context, someone has recently done this. You can go to
[http://www.buddhistapps.com](http://www.buddhistapps.com/) and see the
homepage for a Tibetan Buddhist application. It is a pretty basic
application, focusing on taking refuge, generating Bodhicitta, mantra
recitation, and then dedication of merit.

The nice thing about it is that it gives the Tibetan prayers in
transliterated Tibetan **and** they recorded a monk chanting the prayers
in Tibetan.

For anyone who has practiced within a Tibetan context in the past, as I
have, the way that non-native speakers chant Tibetan is all over the map
and is often not very melodious. This makes it a helpful touch. I wish
that this was available as a general framework. I could see using the
same structure (with some additional steps) with an app for the [Five
Mountain Sangha](http://www.fivemountain.org/) for daily practice as
well. I'd also like to see an application put together to allow for
sutra reading for all of the sutras that are available as unencumbered
English text. That might be a taller order given the variability in
quality of translation. For those interested in the application, you can
get it
[here](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=328219107&mt=8)
though they would like $1.99 for it (which is pretty minimal).
