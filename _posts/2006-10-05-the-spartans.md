Frank Miller's vision of the Spartan stand at the Battle of Thermopylae against the Persian empire is finally being made into a movie.

Remember their epitaph:
<blockquote>Traveler,    take this word to the men of Lakedaimon:
We who lie buried here did what they told us to do.</blockquote>
The movie looks incredible, though pretty obviously heavily stylized.
