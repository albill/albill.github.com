[Nortd Labs](http://www.nortd.com) is in the Bay Area for the [Maker
Faire](http://makerfaire.com/) this weekend. They are the creators of
the [Lasersaur](http://labs.nortd.com/lasersaur/), which is an open
source laser cutter. They've been working on this design for the last
year and have kits out to their initial builders now. They'll be
incorporating feedback as they publish all of their designs. They came
by [Ace Monster Toys](http://www.acemonstertoys.org) to talk about the
project last night. One of the dirty secrets of the hackerspace/maker
movement is our laser cutters. They are all pretty much from China
because the nice, American made, laser cutters like Epilog's, all cost
at least five times as much as the cheapest, so-so, Chinese cutters.
Since most hackerspaces are pretty poor, everyone winds up buying the
Chinese ones. The problem with these is that, well, they're pretty much
crap. I mean, if you get *really* lucky, it will all be working with no
boards hanging loose, wires dangling, etc. when you get it off of the
container ship. Even then, people wind up using crap programs to control
the laser cutter that require you to run under Windows with really
cheesy software or drivers without a full range of control. Nice things
cost money and this is what you get for cheap. Enter the Lasersaur. It
is built with an extruded aluminum t-slot frame, arduino based
electronics, and the specs are completely open. You can see the [current
build of materials](http://labs.nortd.com/lasersaur/bom) of what you'll
need for it. Nortd is still working on a lot of the control software but
people will be able to easily write customer software and add custom
hardware to the design. For hackerspaces that are happy to hack on
things, this has a lot of potential. If the design had been further
along, we would have probably gone this way at Ace Monster Toys. (As it
is, our 80 watt 800 lb. Chinese laser cutter will be here in a week.) I
took video with a higher end webcam of the talk last night. It is an
hour and eight minutes long and is a pretty casual conversation with a
lot of off-camera questions from members of Ace Monster Toys. If you're
interested in the Lasersaur, you may find it worth watching. I took it
mainly so members of AMT that couldn't make it could see the
presentation!
