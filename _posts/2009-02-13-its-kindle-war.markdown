I want a Kindle 2. Of course I do (as I hear my wife's voice whispering
in my head). I have one problem with it though: I abhor all Digital
Rights Management. Evil, evil shit. It's all well and good at first (at
least some people think so) until three, five or ten years later when
the rights server goes offline and all that media that you thought you
owned turns out to be "owned." You lose access to it and that's it,
you're screwed, bub. This is why I don't buy music, tv shows, or movies
on iTunes even though I have an iPhone and a Macbook Pro. I'm Cory
Doctorow's little bum boy when it comes to DRM. So, with the Kindle (and
it's little brother, Prince Michael Jackson II), all content that you
can purchase so easily from Amazon is, of course, DRM'd. That makes me
not want to give one cent to buy it for fear that my library will just
go up in a puff of magic smoke in five or ten years. What really needs
to happen, as happened with DVDs in general and Blu-Ray to some extent,
is that the Amazon DRM format needs to be cracked so the books can be
freed from it. Even if it was a pain in the ass, if I knew I could do
that, I would feel much more free to buy books from Amazon for the
Kindle. Until then, I suspect that I'll be stuck with my groaning
shelves of books filling my house. Personally, I'd rather free up all
that space and go all Zen... :-)
