Work has been a bit scattered over the last week. It's easy to feel like you aren't accomplishing much when there are so many random things to do. It's kind of funny because some people are convinced that I'm the organized, process task-focused guy but I get mired in shit often enough that I wonder. We suffer from too many meetings but when you don't go, you find out about the important bit that you just missed in the one your skipped. Ah well.

The first draft of the ritual was given to Sam to go over. R went out to the Shumway Mansion and gave them our menu. We'll be paying them tomorrow. We've taken care of the photography and R arranged for the flowers. I should check on Sam's reservation but we seem to be progressing. We ok'd the rings earlier in the week so they are being cast as we speak. In a way, it will be a relief to be finished and on our way to Italy for a couple of weeks away from it all. I'm taking a total of three weeks off from work, which will be nice. I'll have time to catch up on the jetlag once we return.

Just one more task to be done.

I picked up <b> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0262511096">Zen and the Brain</a></b> and <b> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0226580245">The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe</a></b>. The latter interfaces with my current interest in fifteenth and sixteenth century British history (though no pirates! Arr!). The former is one of the first looks, and the first comprehensive, on the neurological basis of meditative states. It's published by MIT Press and is huge. The author is a neurologist and a zen practitioner and used his skills and interest in one an investigation in what is going on in the brain during meditative practice. I flipped through it a bit and it is pretty impressive. I might actually have to buy it to keep for the library.

I quickly used it to pick up Paul Di Filippo's recent novel, <b> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1587155079">A Mouthful of Tongues: Her Totipotent Tropicanalia</a></b>, which is probably not the most work appropriate choice but, hey, I wanted to read it! Soon, I will begin to climb Mt. Stephenson again because the third volume of the Baroque cycle should be appearing soon.
