Since today is payday and I never seem to have enough books (hah!), I
ordered a few more today:

-   **[The Nature of Magic : An Anthropology of
    Consciousness](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1845200950/102-5812800-5064112?_encoding=UTF8&v=glance)**by
    Susan Greenwood
-   **[Accelerando](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441012841/102-5812800-5064112?_encoding=UTF8&v=glance)**by
    Charles Stross
-   **[Lady of
    Mazes](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0765312190/102-5812800-5064112?_encoding=UTF8&v=glance)**by
    Karl Schroeder
-   **[Scardown](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/055358751X/102-5812800-5064112?_encoding=UTF8&v=glance)**by
    Elizabeth Bear

The first is Susan Greenwood's new work on the nature of magical
consciousness for practitioners of pagan and magical faiths. It's an
academic texts but Susan is a scholar-practitioner and it comes highly
recommended to me by other members of the Nature Religion Scholars
e-mail list. **Accelerando** is Charles Stross' new novel. You can also
find it online at
[http://www.accelerando.org](http://www.accelerando.org) for free if you
don't want a physical copy. **Lady of Mazes** is the brand new Karl
Schroeder book. He wrote **Ventus** a few years back and **Permanence**.
I liked both of them though the fairly hard science fiction vision of a
potentially depressing future in **Permanence** was actually quite good.
One of its primary questions is "What happens to sentient life if it is
inevitable that it will decline or evolve out of intelligence, which is
only a temporary feature of creatures?" **Scardown** is the sequel to
**Hammered**, Bear's debut novel. She is an up and coming author, I
think, and her work is pretty fun. Schroeder and Stross are both
computer people who happen to have become science fiction writers.
Schroeder's work is pretty intellectually rigorous. The other recent
novels that I recommend for thinking science fiction readers are the
three books by John Wright comprising **[The Golden
Age](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0812579844)**. I'm
currently about 60 pages into the Peter Watts novel I mentioned
yesterday along with some of Thrangu Rinpoche's Buddhist work.
