<p>Since today is payday and I never seem to have enough books (hah!), I ordered 
a few more today:</p>
<ul><li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1845200950/102-5812800-5064112?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance">The Nature of Magic : An Anthropology of Consciousness</a> </b>by Susan Greenwood</li>
	<li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441012841/102-5812800-5064112?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance">Accelerando</a> </b>by Charles Stross</li>
	<li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0765312190/102-5812800-5064112?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance">Lady of Mazes</a> </b>by Karl Schroeder</li>
	<li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/055358751X/102-5812800-5064112?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance">Scardown</a> </b>by Elizabeth Bear</li></ul>

The first is Susan Greenwood's new work on the nature of magical consciousness for practitioners of pagan and magical faiths. It's an academic texts but Susan is a scholar-practitioner and it comes highly recommended to me by other members of the Nature Religion Scholars e-mail list.

<b>Accelerando</b> is Charles Stross' new novel. You can also find it online at <a href="http://www.accelerando.org">http://www.accelerando.org</a> for free if you don't want a physical copy.

<b>Lady of Mazes</b> is the brand new Karl Schroeder book. He wrote <b>Ventus</b> a few years back and <b>Permanence</b>. I liked both of them though the fairly hard science fiction vision of a potentially depressing future in <b>Permanence</b> was actually quite good. One of its primary questions is &quot;What happens to sentient life if it is inevitable that it will decline or evolve out of 
intelligence, which is only a temporary feature of creatures?&quot;

<b>Scardown</b> is the sequel to <b>Hammered</b>, Bear's debut novel. She is an up and coming author, I think, and her work is pretty fun. 

Schroeder and Stross are both computer people who happen to have become science fiction writers. Schroeder's work is pretty intellectually rigorous. The other recent novels that I recommend for thinking science fiction readers are the three books by John Wright comprising <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0812579844">The Golden Age</a></b>.

I'm currently about 60 pages into the Peter Watts novel I mentioned yesterday along with some of Thrangu Rinpoche's Buddhist work.
