R and I visited two houses this morning after I got up at godawfulearly to meet to do costuming stuff. The first one was in Wallingford and was a little rundown but huge and in a great neighborhood. R didn't like it because the basement rooms had short ceilings and while it was low but fine for me, she could feel her hair brushing it. (For those that don't know, R is about six feet tall and/or an inch or so taller than me...)

The second house we looked at was this Tudor up by the Snappy Dragon in the Northgate area. It&apos;s a wonderful little house with two floors and a basement. It was advertised as a three bedroom but one of the bedrooms is about half the size of the rest. It faces east, with a window, on the second floor so it would be a good ritual chapel for Work.

We liked the place so much that we forked over the $35 each (<strong>!!!!!</strong>) for the credit check/application and filled out the forms. Of course, I warned them that my credit history sucked because of my bankruptcy when I got divorced but R&apos;s is good and I have a good five years (tomorrow!) at Microsoft. We're really hoping to get this place.

If we do get it, we'll have it on 7/15 because they didn't want to hold it until the end of the month. Since we're on our California trip 7/11 to 7/18, this means that we could start moving in as soon as we get back. I'd probably do it in a couple of stages. R wants to do her place all at once.

Let's hope we get the place. We should hear by Monday afternoon.
