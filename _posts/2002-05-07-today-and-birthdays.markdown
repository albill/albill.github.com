Yesterday was R'sbirthday. (She's had people ask "What day is Cinco De Mayo?" when she's told them that's when her birthday is...) I had my lodge and then I met her and some friends over at the Barca, a local bar/club for drinks for a couple of hours. We got to hear amusing tales of friends travelling in other countries. My favorite is a certain friend talking about this trip through Mexico when he was younger that sounded pretty similar to "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" with the equal mixing of super weird and surreal shit and drugs.

This evening I had my fire spinning class with the Cabiri. It was ass-numbing cold so we all called it quits after an hour of trying to spin. and I ran off to the U District and got Thai food at my favorite place before meeting J and another friend down the street at a place where they decided to eat.

I&apos;m currently trying to decide whether I feel like working on my home page or not tonight. I think I might just read on the Medicine Buddha for a while instead.

I need to call tomorrow, I suppose, since we're supposed to get together and hang out for the first time in a month or more. I'm looking forward to it.
