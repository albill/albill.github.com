Jim Kunstler on the coming times:

> The impediments to clear collective thinking about the problems we
> face were not washed away by Hurricane Katrina -- and may still be
> there after Hurricane Ophelia romps up the Atlantic coast later this
> week\
>  One Big Thought making the rounds of the editorial pages is that
> "fuel efficiency" will be the cure-all for our energy predicament --
> that if everybody could trade in his Ford Explorer for a Toyota Prius,
> life in the USA would just purr happily forward. This has been the
> position of the more metaphysical branches of the enviro sector, as
> personified by the Rocky Mountain Institute and its preposterous
> "hyper-car" project. \
>  The truth is that it does not really matter whether the freeways are
> crammed full of SUVs or nimble hybrid cars. The problem is
> car-dependency and the infrastructure for daily living predicated on
> it, not the kind of vehicles we run. I have yet to hear one US senator
> of either party propose that part of the recent $300 billion highway
> bill ought to be redirected to rebuilding America's passenger rail
> system -- even after the bitter lesson of Katrina, which demonstrated
> that people who don't own cars can't get out of harm's way in this
> country.
