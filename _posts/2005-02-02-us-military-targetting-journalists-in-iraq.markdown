<blockquote><h3>Blogstorm descending on CNN</h3>
	<p>Right-wing blogs, including
	<a target="_blank" href="http://littlegreenfootballs.com">Little Green 
	Footballs</a>, have moved their sights from CBS
	<a target="_blank" href="http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=14552_CNN-_Targeted_for_Seeking_the_Truth">
	to CNN</a>.&nbsp; At the center of the blogstorm are comments made by my former 
	boss Eason Jordan at Davos, in which he alleged that the U.S. military had 
	been targeting journalists in Iraq. See
	<a href="http://www.forumblog.org/blog/2005/01/do_us_troops_ta.html">the 
	original post</a> about it by Rony Abovitz (founder of the
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.z-kat.com/">digital surgery company 
	Z-Kat</a>, attending the forum as a &quot;tech pioneer&quot;), which he posted on the
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.forumblog.org">Forumblog</a> - an &quot;unnoficial&quot; 
	blog where World Econ Forum participants posted their impressions and views 
	about sessions they attended. The
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.weforum.org/site/knowledgenavigator.nsf/Content/_S13066?open&event_id=1204&year_id=2005">
	official WEF summary</a> does not mention Eason&#39;s remarks, and there is no 
	transcript or webcast. But I was in the room and Rony&#39;s account is 
	consistent with what I heard. I was also contributing to the Forumblog, but 
	to be honest, Jordan happens to be my former boss who promoted me and 
	defended me in some rather sticky situations after my reporting angered the 
	Chinese government. As CNN&#39;s &quot;senior statesman&quot; over the years, Eason has 
	done some things I agreed with and other things I wondered about. But at 
	least when it came to China, he was no apologist and defended my reports on 
	human rights abuses and political dissent. So I don&#39;t feel that I&#39;m in a 
	position to speak objectively on this issue, especially since I haven&#39;t been 
	in Iraq and don&#39;t know the real situation on the ground. I would very much 
	like to hear from other journalists working in Iraq. I&#39;d like to hear, 
	particularly, from other CNN reporters working in Iraq. Whether they&#39;ll be 
	willing to speak out publicly on this issue is doubtful, but maybe others 
	will. Maybe we&#39;ll hear from some of them anonymously. Maybe
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.kevinsites.net/2005_01_23_archive.html#110676213140973816">
	Kevin Sites</a> and other journalists blogging from Iraq will let us know 
	what they think.</p>
