> ### Blogstorm descending on CNN
>
> Right-wing blogs, including [Little Green
> Footballs](http://littlegreenfootballs.com), have moved their sights
> from CBS [to
> CNN](http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=14552_CNN-_Targeted_for_Seeking_the_Truth).
> At the center of the blogstorm are comments made by my former boss
> Eason Jordan at Davos, in which he alleged that the U.S. military had
> been targeting journalists in Iraq. See [the original
> post](http://www.forumblog.org/blog/2005/01/do_us_troops_ta.html)
> about it by Rony Abovitz (founder of the [digital surgery company
> Z-Kat](http://www.z-kat.com/), attending the forum as a "tech
> pioneer"), which he posted on the
> [Forumblog](http://www.forumblog.org) - an "unnoficial" blog where
> World Econ Forum participants posted their impressions and views about
> sessions they attended. The [official WEF
> summary](http://www.weforum.org/site/knowledgenavigator.nsf/Content/_S13066?open&event_id=1204&year_id=2005)
> does not mention Eason's remarks, and there is no transcript or
> webcast. But I was in the room and Rony's account is consistent with
> what I heard. I was also contributing to the Forumblog, but to be
> honest, Jordan happens to be my former boss who promoted me and
> defended me in some rather sticky situations after my reporting
> angered the Chinese government. As CNN's "senior statesman" over the
> years, Eason has done some things I agreed with and other things I
> wondered about. But at least when it came to China, he was no
> apologist and defended my reports on human rights abuses and political
> dissent. So I don't feel that I'm in a position to speak objectively
> on this issue, especially since I haven't been in Iraq and don't know
> the real situation on the ground. I would very much like to hear from
> other journalists working in Iraq. I'd like to hear, particularly,
> from other CNN reporters working in Iraq. Whether they'll be willing
> to speak out publicly on this issue is doubtful, but maybe others
> will. Maybe we'll hear from some of them anonymously. Maybe [Kevin
> Sites](http://www.kevinsites.net/2005_01_23_archive.html#110676213140973816)
> and other journalists blogging from Iraq will let us know what they
> think.
