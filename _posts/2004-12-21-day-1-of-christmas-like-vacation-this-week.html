<p>Get up a bit after seven instead of sleeping in so I can let furnace service 
guy into house. He, for once, shows up early even. He leaves around 9:10 AM, 
having made me sign a bill and finishing his work.</p>
<p>Around 10:20 AM, I realize that the house is fucking cold. Look at 
thermostat...hmmm...it&#39;s set to 68 but it about 62 in house. I hear furnace 
running but have no heat coming out. Call furnace guys. Furnace guy says &quot;I&#39;ll 
be there in 20 minutes&quot; and shows up an hour later. :-)</p>
<p>He finally leaves just before noon and my furnace is working properly. 
Goodbye, my first morning of slack.</p>
<p>I cook breakfast after calling R to confirm lack of recently purchased 
hamburger in fridge is as observed. </p>
<p>I spent the rest of the afternoon:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Playing on Internet (including actually glancing at work e-mail)</li>
	<li>Reading <b><a href="http://www.celticbuddhism.org/publications.htm">The 
	Mahasiddha and his Idiot Servant</a></b></li>
	<li>Drinking coffee at Third Place Books while purchasing more Christmas 
	presents for my family and friends.</li>
</ol>
<p>I took a present over to Rubylou (and one for that bastard, Sean) and chatted 
with her a bit about her efforts to sponge paint a wall in the living room. 
She&#39;s just started it and guests are coming over Christmas Day. She admits this 
was a questionable plan. Lulu the love kitty (who hates all non-Rubylou 
lifeforms) decides I&#39;m the cutest thing in the world and not only lets me pet 
her but won&#39;t go away and actually lets me pick her up three times, hold her for 
a while, and put her down (for her only to return). For any that know this cat, 
this is beyond freakish. As Rubylou mentioned, I&#39;m one of the few people she 
actually likes but &quot;like&quot; here normally equates to &quot;pet me from three feet away 
and then I&#39;ll run&quot; for her.</p>
<p>Eventually, I go home and R and I go to see <b>Team America</b>, which was 
funny but marred by the moron with the super-geek laugh who decided everything 
from 30 seconds or so in was the funniest thing that he&#39;d ever seen (especially 
if it was Muslims being shot) and wouldn&#39;t shut up the whole time. I liked the 
movie and found it funny but I know that I&#39;ll never watch it again. Once was 
definitely enough. We saw a preview for <b>Napoleon Dynamite</b>, which was 
playing down the hall at this cheap theatre, and I still want to see it.</p>
<p>Note: R brought love in the form of tacos from the taco truck on her way home 
so I actually did eat dinner.</p>
<p>The rest of this evening has been decaf Americanos and reading weblogs. I 
want to finish <b>The Mahasiddha and his Idiot Servant</b> before I go to bed 
tonight so I can start a dzogchen book tomorrow.</p>
<p>On January 10, my classes for my MA program start. Since it is a distance 
based program, this will be mostly reading and report writing but it will suck 
up a lot of time. R and I are also attending training with the Shambhala Center 
in sitting meditation practice on January 14.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#39;ll write a solstice ceremony tomorrow morning for R and I to do in 
the evening of the Longest Night of the year.</p>
