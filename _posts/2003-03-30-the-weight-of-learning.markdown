So, I have about 26 hours before my flight to London and then to Athens leaves...I&apos;m actually in the office today for an hour or two because a brother sent me a file of practices and translations of some magical materials (Buddhist) that I want to read while I&apos;m away. I also realized that I have library books on Neoplatonism that I should return before leaving the country. I just photocopied the book on Harran and the one on Reading Neoplatonism. 

Unfortunately, paper weighs and the primary luggage for R and myself are backpacks. I&apos;ve been planning on bringing much of the <b>Dune</b> series with me for flight reading and relaxing. I figure that I can discard each of my abused copies as I finish them. The same go for the printouts of the magical materials. I think it would be kind of funny for me to go to vacation to Europe with 50 lbs. of paper on my back that weighs more than anything else I&apos;m bringing...

 So far, I&apos;m bringing a few novels, a popular Hermetic work (from Denning and Philips), a book on Deity Yoga and the printouts... I&apos;ll either run out of things to read or I won&apos;t touch most of them. It depends on how much time we spend sitting on ferries and how tired we are. 

Last night, R and I rented <b>Ringu</b>, the original Japanese movie that <b>The Ring</b> is a remake of. We haven&apos;t seen the remake but I heard the original was better. It&apos;s definitely a creepy movie and, while odd in a typical Japanese way (I&apos;m never sure I get a lot of their cultural references), it was good. There are a couple of sequels available as well.

Now I&apos;m going to go return my library books, return the videos (think of the late fees!) and maybe look at a used book store.

I suppose getting a phurba through customs might be difficult, eh?

(Realistically, none of my practices require one and I&apos;m probably clueless on proper use.)
