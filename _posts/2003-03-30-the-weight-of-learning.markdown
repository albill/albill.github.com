So, I have about 26 hours before my flight to London and then to Athens
leaves...I'm actually in the office today for an hour or two because a
brother sent me a file of practices and translations of some magical
materials (Buddhist) that I want to read while I'm away. I also realized
that I have library books on Neoplatonism that I should return before
leaving the country. I just photocopied the book on Harran and the one
on Reading Neoplatonism. Unfortunately, paper weighs and the primary
luggage for R and myself are backpacks. I've been planning on bringing
much of the **Dune** series with me for flight reading and relaxing. I
figure that I can discard each of my abused copies as I finish them. The
same go for the printouts of the magical materials. I think it would be
kind of funny for me to go to vacation to Europe with 50 lbs. of paper
on my back that weighs more than anything else I'm bringing... So far,
I'm bringing a few novels, a popular Hermetic work (from Denning and
Philips), a book on Deity Yoga and the printouts... I'll either run out
of things to read or I won't touch most of them. It depends on how much
time we spend sitting on ferries and how tired we are. Last night, R and
I rented **Ringu**, the original Japanese movie that **The Ring** is a
remake of. We haven't seen the remake but I heard the original was
better. It's definitely a creepy movie and, while odd in a typical
Japanese way (I'm never sure I get a lot of their cultural references),
it was good. There are a couple of sequels available as well. Now I'm
going to go return my library books, return the videos (think of the
late fees!) and maybe look at a used book store. I suppose getting a
phurba through customs might be difficult, eh? (Realistically, none of
my practices require one and I'm probably clueless on proper use.)
