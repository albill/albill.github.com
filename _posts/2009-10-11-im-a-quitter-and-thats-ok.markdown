I wrote the following on my blog on Tuesday and then took it down as I
was unsure if I wanted it to be up. (Of course, it went out on all of my
RSS feeds so it didn't really matter...)

After writing this, I spent the rest of the week really thinking about
it and whether I was just being overly nervous, disliking the changes in
my life, etc. On reflection this weekend (after reading quite a few
academic pieces for a project), I realized that I simply didn't want to
spend the next five plus years of my life doing this after all. I want
to keep learning, taking classes and doing things, but I really didn't
want to narrow the focus of my life to doing the PhD and working to
support that (financially and otherwise) for half a decade or more. I
also realized that I was not enamored with the career that I was
potentially building for myself to follow the PhD. As I mention in my
original post, there are things that I want to do but most of them
really don't require a doctorate. They simply require the diligence and
commitment of doing things instead of wandering through life. I
**already** have a successful career and I really do enjoy much of what
goes on in the tech world and I don't want to lose that either. So I've
made the decision, and told the GTU officials, my advisor, and my
professors, that I'm leaving the program effective immediately. We'll
see what I do from here on out but I thought I would mention it here. I
do plan to continue to take various classes in a variety of programs
(such as hands-on classes at the [Crucible](http://thecrucible.org/),
[Mindfulness Based Stress
Reduction](http://www.mindfullivingprograms.com/whatMBSR.php) training,
maybe some more programming classes, and my seminary work) but nothing
towards a specific degree at this point. I also want to spend more
focused time studying the Dharma as a practitioner, not simply focusing
on the scholastic side. I'll be satisfied with my existing Master's
degree.
