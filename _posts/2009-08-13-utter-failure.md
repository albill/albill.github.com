I managed to gather all of one response to my last post and it was a nonsensical one at that! (Those who read this mirrored on Livejournal responded a bit more but I pretty much knew the answer there since they are all friends of mine.)

I suppose that means that I write about what I want here since there is no particular thing that motivates people to read this blog. A vote for the status quo!
