I am deflowered &<br /> yet a virgin. I sanctify & am not sanctified<br /> happy is he that embraceth me. for in the night season<br /> I am sweet, in the day full of pleasure

Purge your streets o<br /> you sons of men, & wash your houses clean<br /> Make your selves holy, & put on righteousness<br /> Cast out your old strumpets, & burn their clothes<br /> Abstain from the company of other women that are<br /> defiled, that are sluttish, & not so handsome, &<br /> beautiful as I. And then will I come & dwell<br /> amongst you. And behold I will bring forth<br /> Children unto you: & they shall be the sons of comfort<br /> I will open my garments, & stand naked before you<br /> that your love may be more enflamed toward me.
