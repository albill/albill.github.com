I present to you the new queen of the household, Miss Moppet!

This is the new kitten that R and I chose from the Alameda Animal Shelter this last weekend. She was a rescued stray and is now about five months old. She's very loving and affectionate but seems to drool an awful lot when rubbing against people...

I picked her up from the vet today where they had just spayed her. She has three little stiches on her belly to watch. She's staying in the spare room right now, just in time for Madeline's arrive from Seattle tomorrow.
