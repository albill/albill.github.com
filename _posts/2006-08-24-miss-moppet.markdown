This is the new kitten that R and I chose from the Alameda Animal
Shelter this last weekend. She was a rescued stray and is now about five
months old. She's very loving and affectionate but seems to drool an
awful lot when rubbing against people... I picked her up from the vet
today where they had just spayed her. She has three little stiches on
her belly to watch. She's staying in the spare room right now, just in
time for Madeline's arrive from Seattle tomorrow.
