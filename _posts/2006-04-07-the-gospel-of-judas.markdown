An acquaintance of mine, Father Jordan Stratford, has written a short,
excellent post on the **Gospel of Judas** that we publicly released
yesterday. For thoes interested in the topic, his post is [worth
reading](http://egina.blogspot.com/2006/04/i-know-who-you-are-and-where-you-have.html).
Father Stratford links to excerpts available online
[here](http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/judastxt.pdf).
