An acquaintance of mine, Father Jordan Stratford, has written a short, excellent post on the <strong>Gospel of Judas</strong> that we publicly released yesterday. For thoes interested in the topic, his post is <a href="http://egina.blogspot.com/2006/04/i-know-who-you-are-and-where-you-have.html">worth reading</a>.

Father Stratford links to excerpts available online <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/judastxt.pdf">here</a>.
