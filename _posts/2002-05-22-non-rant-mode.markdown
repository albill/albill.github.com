Now that I'm done looking like an asshole for the day, I wanted to post in support of Brandy and her partner Ted. They will be doing the following in Seattle this Thursday: <em><strong>Getting Closer to the Gods</strong></em> <strong>Subtitled:</strong> <em>Using the "Temple/Research Feedback Loop" to establish contact and enhance relationships with Deific forces</em> <strong>The Synopsis:</strong> The class will present the skills, techniques, and thought-tools to help you establish a relationship with the deity of your choice on your own terms, as safely as possible, with reliable, predictable results. Both the theoretical and practical aspects of the methodology will be explored with real-life examples from the presenters' experiences with deities of multiple pantheons and cultures. Question and answer session if time allows. This presentation is, in many ways, a lead-in to Brandy's soon-to-be-presented Deity Workshops. <strong>Temporal/Spatial Particulars:</strong> Thursday, May 23rd from 7:00 PM to 8:45 PM Edge of the Circle Books 701 E. Pike, Seattle, Wa I certainly plan on being there. ;-)
