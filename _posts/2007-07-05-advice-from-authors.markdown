I ran into this quote today and it seemed quite relevant to some of the
issues with our society.

> “If you want to really hurt your parents, and you don’t have the nerve
> to be gay, the least you can do is go into the arts. I’m not kidding.
> The arts are no way to make a living. They are a very human way of
> making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or
> badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven’s sake. Sing in the
> shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend,
> even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can. You will get an
> enormous reward. You will have created something.” -- Kurt Vonnegut

This brings to mind my favorite quote from Bruce Sterling as well:

> Don’t become a well-rounded person. Well rounded people are smooth and
> dull. Become a thoroughly spiky person. Grow spikes from every angle.
> Stick in their throats like a pufferfish. If you want to woo the muse
> of the odd, don’t read
> [Shakespeare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare). Read
> [Webster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Webster)’s revenge plays.
> Don’t read [Homer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer) and
> [Aristotle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle). Read
> [Herodotus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus) where he’s off
> talking about [Egyptian women having public sex with
> goats](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/text?lookup=hdt.+2.46&vers=Loeb).
> If you want to read about myth don’t read [Joseph
> Campbell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell), read about
> convulsive religion, read about voodoo and the
> [Millerites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millerites) and the [Munster
> Anabaptists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Münster_Rebellion). There
> are hundreds of years of extremities, there are vast legacies of
> mutants. There have always been geeks. There will always be geeks.
> Become the apotheosis of geek. Learn who your spiritual ancestors
> were. You didn’t come here from nowhere. There are reasons why you’re
> here. Learn those reasons. Learn about the stuff that was buried
> because it was too experimental or embarrassing or inexplicable. --
> *From [The Wonderful Power of
> Storytelling](http://www.eff.org/Misc/Publications/Bruce_Sterling/comp_game_designers.article)
