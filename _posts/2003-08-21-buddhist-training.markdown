So, I attended the first of the montly Lojong classes at <a href="http://www.pemakilaya.org">Pema Kilya</a> on Monday night. A bunch of the students are getting together on a monthly basis to listen to recordings of some of the teachings earlier this year by Kilung Rinpoche and discuss readings on Lojong from a variety of texts. We're mainly going to use Trungpa's book on the topic.

I'm not sure if Lojong is really "my" thing but it is one this group is having new practitioners work with initially.

I was also given some instruction on the "Seven Points of Vairocana," which is really just the basics of sitting meditation, posture, etc. I took some notes and it was useful.

Longterm, its hard to say what role Buddhism will play in comparison to Hermeticism in my spirituality but since I don't see too many (or really any) Hermetic meditation and contemplation instructors or texts sitting around, I work with what I can. It's the same mind and body for all people so technique should be applicable.
