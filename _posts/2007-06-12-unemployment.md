I'm now ungainfully umemployed... This will last a day and then I start at Mozilla on Thursday morning. Today I did another goodbye lunch at MobiTV and had my exit interview. I am going to miss a bunch of the people that I worked with, especially my development team and a number of my QA peers.

I'll do a few days of work there and then R and I are going to Ohio for a <a href="http://www.daiun-ji.org/inc/docs/june_retreat_schedule.pdf">short Buddhist retreat</a> with <a href="http://www.daiun-ji.org/">Daiun-Ji Great Cloud Temple</a>.

The only downside so far is that I had accrued almost two weeks of vacation time and now I'm starting over from scratch. Since we're planning a vacation of a couple of weeks to Japan this Fall, I'm hoping that I have enough time available (or the ability to go in the hole) to still do my trip. We'll see how it goes.

As I mentioned the other day, my Mozilla blog for QA work is at <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/al/">http://blog.mozilla.com/al/</a>. I have no specific plans for it yet but I'm sure that I'll be making use of it.
