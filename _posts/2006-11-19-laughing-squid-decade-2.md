R and I went over to San Francisco for the <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/laughing-squid-decade-2/"><strong>Laughing Squid: Decade 2</strong></a> party last night. This was the 11th anniversary party for <a href="http://www.laughingsquid.com">Laughing Squid</a>, a Bay Area institution at this point.

We ran into a couple of people that we knew, stayed for a couple of bands and laughs and then ducked out a little before midnight. I've put up a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157594382935857/">photo set</a> on Flickr from the event. Taking pictures at night events in clubs is always kind of iffy so these photos are what they are.

Here are a couple of my lovely wife though. :-)
