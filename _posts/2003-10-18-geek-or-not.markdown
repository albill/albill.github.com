Jezus fookin' krist! You'd think they'd make it a little easier...

I work on fucking software for a living but I can't seem to get Redhat Linux installed on my fucking laptop for the life of me. I spent two hours trying to figure it out.

So, I made a boot CD, then I made CD1 and CD2 of the distribution... I boot off the CD, it does the "Welcome to Happy Happy Linux Install" shit. Select a keyboard...ok...select a language...ok....choose where to install from...ok...I pick the CD drive..."I don't detect a core Redhat cd, put the fucker in!"...wait a sec...I have a CD in you dumb piece of shit, you booted off of it!!!

Try putting CD1 in and see if it thinks <strong>that</strong> is the core CD...uhm...no...

Go read installation documentation (for the first time...)...ok...I think I'm doing the right thing but... Ok, I'll make a fucking boot floppy disk and a second driver disk... boot off the floppy..."Welcome to Happy Happy Linux Install"...type 'linux dd'...oh, you want to load a driver disk from the floppy?...ok....loads drivers....continues on to "I don't detect a core Redhat cd..."

You know, I used to install Linux back in 1995. I have it on several machines in my webmaster job and at home. I had to hand type parameters in and I always got it to work. Hell, I own a copy of Redhat 6. I've never even bought a copy of Windows in my life but I bought Redhat.

Why can't I get Redhat 9 to install on my Compaq Armada m300 laptop? Did I lose my brain somewhere?
