I've <a href="http://www.arcanology.com/2007/10/27/sip-based-voip-problems-in-leopard/">written previously</a> that when Mac OS X 10.5 (aka "Leopard") came out, it broke all of the SIP-based voice over ip applications. This was something that hadn't been broken in the developer builds but only in the final release, thus giving people making VOIP software a pleasant surprise for "Leopard Day."

People seem to have largely worked around the issue and released updated clients for Leopard. <a href="http://www.gizmoproject.com/">The Gizmo Project</a>, which I normally use for VOIP with Mozilla, released a beta almost immediately and got a full release not long after.

Yesterday, the first update to Leopard came out, making it 10.5.1. I installed this and immediately noticed that VOIP no longer worked for software using SIP. Since I was playing around with <a href="http://xmeeting.sourceforge.net/pages/xmeeting.php">Xmeeting</a> as an alternative to the Gizmo Project, I figured it was just Xmeeting. That turned out not to be the case. When I fired up my work laptop, which still runs OS X 10.4, everything worked fine. As always, Skype seems to work fine but I actually don't generally use it.

So it seems that Apple has once again managed to break the applications that use SIP with an OS update. I haven't seen any other reports of this but I really don't think my machine is particularly unique. We'll see what happens.
