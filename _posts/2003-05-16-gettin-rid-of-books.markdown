This is directed at the Seattle tribe. I have a load of books that I
want to get rid of. I've read them and they are either annoying, not
special or unneeded. Most of them are novels but there are various other
things. Things of rare or true occult value are not in this list. I need
to figure out where I can dump them in such a way as to be relatively
convenient and maybe to give me something in return. Since most people
and places rip you off in a horrid way when you sell books, I'm
interested in suggestions.
