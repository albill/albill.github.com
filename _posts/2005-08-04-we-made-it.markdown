After a three hour plane flight, we have made it to San Diego.

We're at the [Park Manor
Suites](http://www.parkmanorsuites.com/home.html) near the zoo. We have
a very nice suite here in the 1920s hotel. It even has free wifi!

We had a nice dinner at **Jimmy Carter's**across the street and did a
bit of a walk near the park.

Tomorrow is the pre-wedding lunch with my inlaws and extended family.
Saturday evening is the wedding.

I have my ipod, a laptop and free wifi. I also have a wonderful book on
approaching a theology for polytheism and some novels. I will survive.
