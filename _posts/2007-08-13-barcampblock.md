A number of us at Mozilla will be attending <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampBlock">BarCampBlock</a> this weekend.

BarCampBlock is an example of the BarCamp series of unconferences. You can find information on a number of these occurring all over the world on the <a href="http://www.barcamp.org">BarCamp website</a>.

The <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampBlockSessions">session list</a> is looking pretty interesting so far. So far I'm planning on attending the following ones for sure:
<ul>
	<li>Online communities, open source and the gift economy</li>
	<li>A web app for the whole family -- How to legally engage kids and youths (under the age of 13).</li>
	<li>Dialogue TV -- How to bring "Conversation Cafe" style dialogues to the web (podcast or video)</li>
</ul>
Mozilla is also proud to be one of the sponsors of BarCampBlock as well. Personally, I think these kinds of events are where a lot of the interesting ideas people have in their heads around the web, open source, and communication percolate out.

I hope to see at least a few members of the Mozilla community there. I've heard that the event is expecting at least 400 people and that it may go as high as 800. Not bad for a very loosely configured event on relatively short notice (at least for most of us).
