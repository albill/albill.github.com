The other thing that we did this week was go see Einstuerzende Neubauten
this week for R's birthday. I'd never seen them in concert before but R
has been a big fan for quite a while and it was a chance to get out. The
show was at The Showbox in downtown Seattle. That place is a fairly
good-sized club. I realized that I had been in it once back in 2000 for
a Legendary Pink Dots show (which I did not like) with Redegg and other
housemembers of the time. The show was fairly long and seemed to
alternate pretty heavily between songs that I found more interesting and
more...odd...pieces. I'm told that it was typical in that regard. I do
wonder how a band with a cult only following (there were probably 300
people there) survives year after year sometimes but I suppose it is an
interesting life. R and I went to Dick's Drive-In afterwards and bought
some much needed greasy burgers.
