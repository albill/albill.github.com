I read these after hearing about them on <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> and I found them to be interesting (and short!). As a “self-taught” engineer, this hits close to home for me and I’ve wondered the same things before.

Almost all of the female engineers I work with have either a BS or an MA degree in the Computer Science or Electrical Engineering. In contrast, probably half the guys seem to (and less in some disciplines, like QA where I work directly).

As a "self-made" engineer, I've always counted myself fortunate to have been in the right place at the right time and called it a day but my grandfather was an electrical engineer at Boeing. I was around him as a child, he gave me a Timex Sinclair to play with when I was probably 10 or 11 and I lived with him in my teens. Engineering and "geek" stuff was definitely seen as an interesting an important thing in that household even if not discussed a lot. Eventually I became an early Internet user (1988 or '89) through backdoor access at the local university and I ran a BBS for probably five years so I came in through the hobby angle.

The essays are:
