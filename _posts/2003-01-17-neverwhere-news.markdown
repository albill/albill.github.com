I just saw this on [Neil Gaiman's
weblog](http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/journal.asp):

> Hello Mr. Gaiman,My name is Pamela Kipnes and I am the Marketing
> Manager for A&E Home Video/New Video. Through our deal with the BBC,
> A&E Home Video will release Neverwhere on DVD in a 2 pack set in June
> 2003. We are all very excited about this project, and I was hoping
> that you might want to be involved. If you were interested, I'd love
> to hear your thoughts on potential DVD bonus features, plus any other
> marketing or promotional ideas you might have. I'll look forward to
> hearing from you. Kind regards, Pamela Kipnes

**Woot!** It's about time...
