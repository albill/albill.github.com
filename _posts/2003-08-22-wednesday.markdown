So, last night I had coffee with Rubylou for the first time in, oh, I
dunno, a year? That doesn't sound right so maybe it's only been eight or
nine months. I picked her up after wandering down to Edge of the Circle
Books (gak) to pick up a book since a nice person gave me a gift
certificate there for my birthday. I got the new evocation and talisman
book by Pat Zalewski and I read the first 50 pages over a cup of coffee.
It's actually pretty good and seems well put together. Definitely better
than some of his other books though I like most of Pat's work. A good
edition for the Golden Dawn crowd. After I picked Rubylou up, we
wandered over to Cafe Ladro for some coffee and to chat about various
things. We're both horrid gossips at times and we spoke about all of
you. ;-) Actually, we only did that about half of the time and had more
serious conversations during the rest of it. I didn't realize how soon
she is due with the little girl. Not long now!! I had a nice time. It's
been too long since we hung out.
