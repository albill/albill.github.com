This is a rough draft that I sat down and outlined over the last hour.
Parts of it are still missing but it gives an idea of where I am going
currently. I've shifted my emphasis over to the Golden Dawn's conception
of the Soul. The hardest part is the abstract or "Why should anyone
reading this care?" for discussing it. **The Nature, Structure, and
Purpose of the Soul in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn** Abstract
The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn is the name popularily given to a
late Victorian, pseudo-masonic fraternal order which developed in
England in the last two decades of the 19th century. This organization
has had a preeminent role in alternative or esoteric spirituality that
persists to the current day. The Golden Dawn developed a new synthesis
of the earlier esoteric traditions prevalent in Western Europe from the
Middle Ages through to its era. It drew from existing traditions of
Rosicrucianism, Kabbalah, and Esoteric Christianity as well as the
popular conceptons of Gnosticism and Egyptian religion. As part of their
synthesis of these traditions, the creators of the Golden Dawn
constructed a unique vision of the individual soul and its relation to
the universe. This vision drew on Christian visions of the Fall and
Redemption as well as elements of Jewish Kabbalah, Victorian
understandings of Eyptian mythology, and Renaissance Neoplatonism. The
destiny of the individual human soul was connected directly with the
ultimate purpose of the Cosmos in the mythology of the Golden Dawn. This
created a system of belief that was more than simply a superficial
amalagation of disparate parts or traditions and elevated it to unified
spiritual vision which informed the spiritual work of its adherents.
This vision of human destiny gives the Golden Dawn's teaching a
relevance with the realm of world spiritual traditions. In addition, the
Golden Dawn's work has an impact that still informs individuals and
spiritual movements today, such as the modern Neopagan movement and
Western Esoteric traditions whose work is derived directly from that of
the Golden Dawn. Chapters
