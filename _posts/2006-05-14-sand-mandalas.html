The Asia Society has a series of pictures taken from above of Tibetan monks constructing a sand mandala. If you've never seen close up pictures of one of these, they are <a href="http://www.artnetwork.com/Mandala/gallery.html">quite beautiful</a>. <img src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/sandmandala2001.jpg" border="1" /> The series is up at <a href="http://www.asiasociety.org/arts/mandala/archive.html">here</a>.
