<img hspace="10" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.zhangzhung.net/lj/five-fists_.jpg" />My Yule presents from my mother were waiting for me when I got home today. She sent me a copy Library of America's hardcover edition of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/H-P-Lovecraft-Library-America/dp/1931082723/">H.P. Lovecraft: Tales</a>", edited by Peter Straub. She also sent me a copy of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Five-Fists-Science-Matt-Fraction/dp/1582406057/">The Five Fists of Science</a>" graphic novel.

The first is a fine collection of Lovecraft's stories from a well known series "dedicated to preserving America's best and most significant writing..." I've been wanting this edition for a while as it is much nicer than the old, cheap, and not always well edited paperbacks that I have of much of Lovecraft's work.

The latter is a graphic novel recommended at some point by Warren Ellis in which Mark Twain and Nikola Tesla take on the evil that is Thomas Edison and his plans for the world. Cool steampunk fun.

Thanks, mom!
