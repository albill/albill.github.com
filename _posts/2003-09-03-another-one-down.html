I just found out that a casual acquaintance of mine is dead. No sympathy is required. We weren&apos;t close. We mostly interacted on the Church of Mez list locally.

I hadn&apos;t heard that he&apos;d been having problems so this is a pretty big surprise.

His online sucide note and such is the weirdest thing I&apos;ve seen in a while though.
