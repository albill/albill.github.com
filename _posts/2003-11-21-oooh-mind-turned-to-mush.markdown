I just found out that all of the episodes of [Ghost in the Shell: Stand
Alone
Complex](http://www.destroy-all-monsters.com/sacepisodeguide.shtml) are
available on DVD. I've been looking for some anime to watch since
finishing **Cowboy Bebop** and **Trigun**. I liked the movie and I've
been looking forward to the new one coming out. So I ordered the boxed
set of this tv show this evening. All 26 episodes of fun. I even found
it for about $40.\
