**How Much Starbucks Is Too Much?**

By: Business 2.0 Staff \
 Issue: July 2002\
 **Perhaps it means something that in San Francisco, there are now more
Starbucks outlets than publicly traded Internet companies. Everybody
knows that one day the franchise's caffeinated growth rate will have to
slow, but the numbers argue that it might not be soon.**\
 **The Fastest-Growing Takeout Franchise Ever\

([SBUX](http://qs.money.cnn.com/apps/stockquote?symbols=SBUX)) poured
its first cup of joe in 1971 and didn't open another store for 16 years.

**A Latte in Every Cranny**\
 Starbucks is ubiquitous in some U.S. metro areas, but it's still novel
in most of the country. Morgan Stanley's Michael Sherrick estimates that
the company could more than double its U.S. outlets without impeding
growth. The "saturation point," he thinks, would be reached at a little
over three stores for every 100,000 residents nationwide.

**Plenty of Room for Growth Abroad**\
 Analysts see Starbucks's most inviting growth opportunity in
international markets. Right now the company is eyeing Europe in
particular, where you can find some of the world's heaviest coffee
drinkers but few Starbucks outlet -- yet.\
