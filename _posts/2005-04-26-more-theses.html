<p>I&#39;m finding many more theses relevant to religion when I go digging back a 
few years. Roughly 70 total in the program. Here are some of the more 
interesting (to me) ones.</p>
<p>Title: <b>Satanism and Anton Szandor LaVey: An antithesis of Christianity</b>
<br>
Author: Bandorf, George Andrew <br>
Subject: PHILOSOPHY (0422); RELIGION, PHILOSOPHY OF (0322); THEOLOGY (0469); 
BIOGRAPHY (0304) <br>
Abstract: A systematic study of the satanic philosophy and religion initially 
presented to the American public by Anton Szandor LaVey in the mid-nineteen 
sixties and which has been built upon since that era of American cultural 
revolutionism. Explication of LaVey&#39;s satanic philosophy via a careful 
examination of his original writings is the focus leading to the conclusions: 
(1) The true intent of Satanism is to meet the human need for ritual, fantasy, 
and enchantment, while contemporaneously offering a rational set of beliefs upon 
which humans can base their lives. (2) LaVey is decidedly irreverent to the 
Judeo-Christian traditions largely because he considers these traditions 
outdated, useless, and fostering dependence. (3) LaVey developed his own system 
of beliefs and magical rituals based on ancient pagan and occult practices. He 
is speaking to the demonic side of human nature which we as a species have long 
been conditioned to ignore. </p>
<p>Title: <b>Philosophy, core beliefs, and practices of ancient Latvian religion</b>
<br>
Author: Renouf-Brisco, Heidi Leigh <br>
Subject: HISTORY, ANCIENT (0579); RELIGION, HISTORY OF (0320); LANGUAGE, ANCIENT 
(0289) <br>
Abstract: All three of the Baltic States were slow to join the Christian 
movement that commenced in the thirteenth century by the Teutonic Knights. These 
countries of present-day Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania retained their original 
native religions far into the medieval period. Although Latvian ancient religion 
was banished by the fifteenth century, many peasants continued to practice their 
pre-Christian worship. Much of the antediluvian tradition was passed on through 
generations via folksongs, while other pieces of the Latvian early religion have 
yet to be compiled. This study will make use of primary and secondary sources 
pertaining to Latvia. This study will include research regarding the historical 
background of Latvia, the religious history therein, the philosophy of its 
ancient belief system, and also its core beliefs. The conclusions will 
demonstrate the influence of Latvian early native religion upon the present day 
society of Latvia.</p>
<p>Title: <b>The role of intermediaries</b> <br>
Author: Graziano, Ann L. <br>
Subject: PHILOSOPHY (0422); RELIGION, PHILOSOPHY OF (0322); PSYCHOLOGY, GENERAL 
(0621) <br>
Abstract: The mythology surrounding who will act as an intermediary between 
humankind and God has varied depending on the needs of society. Even so, there 
have been shared characteristics that lend themselves to an interpretation of 
the intermediary as a universal phenomenon. Using various literature from four 
main areas of studies, this paper will explain the origins of the intermediary, 
determine the purpose that they serve in society now as well as in the past and 
discuss the relevance of the intermediary in today&#39;s world. The areas of study 
will be (1)&nbsp;mythology, (2)&nbsp;religion, (3)&nbsp;philosophy, and (4)&nbsp;psychology. The 
conclusion will summarize the results of these studies as well as offer some 
opinions as to what the future holds for the intermediary. </p>
<p>Title: <b>Greek philosophical thought and its essential unity and synthesis 
with Eastern ideas</b> <br>
Author: Butler, John, III<br>
Subject: PHILOSOPHY (0422); THEOLOGY (0469); RELIGION, HISTORY OF (0320) <br>
Abstract: This thesis is a treatise that argues the comparative analysis of 
ideas, and the apparent cross-cultural, philosophical parallelism between the 
two seemingly distinct cultures of the Greeks and the Indians. To support our 
hypothesis, we have excerpted and researched the books of prominent scholars and 
authors, spanning the fields of anthropology, linguistics, history, religion, 
philosophy, and literature. Our methodological view is basically the same as 
that of historians who do not ascribe to the &#39;great man theory,&#39; but instead 
hold fast to the view of &#39;determinism,&#39; which theorizes that history is a record 
of a predetermined goal in which interruptions may occur with unforeseen 
detours, and an ultimate foreordained result. In other words, our viewpoint is 
that there is a natural, cyclic progression that has and will inevitably 
continue to bring the aforementioned cultures together philosophically into one 
coherent whole. </p>
<p>Title: <b>The philosophy and practice of yoga</b> <br>
Author: Bonassin, Vicki Gail Solochek<br>
Subject: PHILOSOPHY (0422); RELIGION, PHILOSOPHY OF (0322) <br>
Abstract: The purpose of this project is to explore yoga in terms of its 
function. The problem exists within yoga&#39;s classification. I will define and 
explain why yoga should ideally be considered a philosophy instead of a religion 
or exercise. The significance of this project is that many individuals who might 
otherwise benefit from yoga shy away from it because they believe it to be some 
weird religion. While yoga does have roots in Hinduism and Buddhism, my basic 
premise is: yoga is a philosophy of religion, possessing a physical basis. In 
accordance, one can be any religion or no religion in order to practice yoga. 
Though yoga can be approached as a religion if so desired, there will be major 
comparisons of difference cited between other religions and yoga as proof that 
yoga has more of a philosophical base to it than a religious one.&nbsp; </p>
