As a promotion for the Simpsons Movie, the local Mountain View 7-11
about two miles from Mozilla has been converted to a Kwik-E-Mart for a

Meeting](http://quality.mozilla.org/node/292) this afternoon so we took
a run over there in [Jay's](http://quality.mozilla.org/user/jay)
convertible. I uploaded a [set of
photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157600783944800/) to
Flickr that I took while we were there. I have a couple below:

**Update:** Whoa. Those donuts have waaaaaay too much sugar in them.
