As a promotion for the Simpsons Movie, the local Mountain View 7-11 about two miles from Mozilla has been converted to a Kwik-E-Mart for a while.

MoCo QA felt a need for squishees after the <a href="http://quality.mozilla.org/node/292">Test Execution Meeting</a> this afternoon so we took a run over there in <a href="http://quality.mozilla.org/user/jay">Jay's</a> convertible.

<strong>Update:</strong> Whoa. Those donuts have waaaaaay too much sugar in them.
