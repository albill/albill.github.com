The rough draft of my short paper on "Male Perspectives in Sula" is pretty much finished. I need to flesh out a bit of the discussion around the only three male characters with any subjectivity in the story but it is a lot better of a paper idea that dwelling on Sula and Nel's relationship. My prof seems to appreciate originality as much as anything else (as that was his only criticism of my first paper: a standard take on Conrad). Writing about the role of men and their relationships to women, self-development and limitations ought to be more interesting to him. It's all really a sketch though. The allowable length is almost laughably short, roughly three pages single spaced. Of course, I would bet it tends to cut down on rambling bullshit from students too. You have to be pretty terse with everything. It also seems to contain my love of adjectives.
