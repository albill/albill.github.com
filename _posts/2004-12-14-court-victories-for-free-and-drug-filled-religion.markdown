## Court allows church to use hallucinogenic tea

**ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico (AP) -- The U.S. Supreme Court sided Friday
with a New Mexico church that wants to use hallucinogenic tea as part of
its Christmas services, despite government objections that the tea is
illegal and potentially dangerous.**

The high court lifted a temporary stay issued last week against using
the hoasca tea while it decides whether the Brazil-based O Centro
Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal is permitted to make it a
permanent part of its services.

The legal battle began after federal agents seized 30 gallons of the tea
in a 1999 raid on the Santa Fe home of the church's U.S. president,
Jeffrey Bronfman.

Bronfman sued the government for the right to use the tea and the church
won a preliminary injunction, which was upheld by 10th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Denver. The Bush administration then took the case
to the Supreme Court.

"They're delighted," attorney Nancy Hollander said of the church members
she represented. "They're so thrilled that they can celebrate Christmas
for the first time since 1998."

Bronfman and attorneys for the government did not immediately return
calls seeking comment.

The church, which has about 140 members in the United States and 8,000
worldwide, said the herbal brew is a central sacrament in its religious
practice, which is a blend of Christian beliefs and traditions rooted in
the Amazon basin.

Hollander said the tea is drunk in a ritual similar to the Catholic
Communion. Church members then sit in a circle and meditate; they
believe the tea brings them closer to God.

The tea is brewed from plants found in the Amazon River Basin and
contains DMT, which officials say is a controlled substance under an
international treaty.

However, Bronfman's complaint contends the tea is "non-addictive, is not
harmful to human health and poses none of the risks commonly found with
the use of certain controlled substances."

The church had drawn parallels to federal protection for members of the
Native American Church using peyote, which also has hallucinogenic
properties.
