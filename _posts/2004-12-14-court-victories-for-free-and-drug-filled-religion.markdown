Supreme Court sided Friday with a New Mexico church that wants to use
hallucinogenic tea as part of its Christmas services, despite
government objections that the tea is illegal and potentially dangerous.</b></p><p>The
high court lifted a temporary stay issued last week against using the
hoasca tea while it decides whether the Brazil-based O Centro Espirita
Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal is permitted to make it a permanent part
of its services.</p><p>The legal battle began after federal agents
seized 30 gallons of the tea in a 1999 raid on the Santa Fe home of the
church's U.S. president, Jeffrey Bronfman.</p><p>Bronfman sued the
government for the right to use the tea and the church won a
preliminary injunction, which was upheld by 10th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Denver. The Bush administration then took the case to the
Supreme Court.</p><p>"They're delighted," attorney Nancy Hollander said
of the church members she represented. "They're so thrilled that they
can celebrate Christmas for the first time since 1998."</p><p>Bronfman and attorneys for the government did not immediately return calls seeking comment.</p><p>The church, which has about 140 members in the United States and 8,000
worldwide, said the herbal brew is a central sacrament in its religious
practice, which is a blend of Christian beliefs and traditions rooted
in the Amazon basin.</p><p>Hollander said the tea is drunk in a ritual
similar to the Catholic Communion. Church members then sit in a circle
and meditate; they believe the tea brings them closer to God.</p><p>The
tea is brewed from plants found in the Amazon River Basin and contains
DMT, which officials say is a controlled substance under an
international treaty.</p><p>However, Bronfman's complaint contends the
tea is "non-addictive, is not harmful to human health and poses none of
the risks commonly found with the use of certain controlled substances."</p><p>The
church had drawn parallels to federal protection for members of the
Native American Church using peyote, which also has hallucinogenic
properties.</p>
