This is the odd news of the day. You can [read the full
story](http://rawstory.com/news/2007/Descendants_of_Sitting_Bull_Crazy_Horse_1220.html)
but the [Lakota people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_people) have
decided to end their treaties (generally not signed willingly) with the
United States.

I wonder how serious the Lakota leaders are in doing this or if this is
more of a tactic for better aid to the reservations and a recognition of
their grievances. Twenty years ago, this would have been immediately
crushed but I expect the U.S. Federal government to be a bit more
careful (because of appearances, if nothing else) in reacting to this.
Personally, I doubt if they will really make a go of it as a completely
independent nation, for economic reasons if nothing else.
