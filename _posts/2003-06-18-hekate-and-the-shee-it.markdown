<p>One of the novel developments in the transition from the rather static
ontologies typical of Middleplatonism to the dynamic emanationism of Neoplatonism
is the doctrine of the unfolding of the world of true being and intellect
from its source in a transcendent, only negatively-conceivable ultimate
unitary principle which is itself beyond being. This unfolding or emanation
is characteristically presented as occurring in a three-stage process:
First, an initial identity of the product with its source, a sort of potential
existence; second, an indefinite procession or unfolding of the product
from its source, and third, a contemplative visionary reversion of the
product upon its source, in which the product becomes aware of its separate
existence and thereby takes on its own distinctive form and definition. <lj-cut text="Read the rest if you are into Gnosticism, Hekate, Chaldean Oracles or a masocist...if that isn&apos;t redundant. It is long...">
The later Neoplatonists such as Proclus, perhaps Porphyry, and the author
of the anonymous <i>Parmenides Commentary<a NAME="fnB0" href="#fn0"></a></i><a HREF="#fn0" name="fnB0">[1]</a>

named these three stages Permanence, Procession and Reversion, and characterized
the three successive modes of the product&apos;s existence during this process
by the terms Existence, Life and Intellect. Previously, Plotinus had applied
a similar terminology, namely Being, Life and Mind, to describe the three
principal aspects of the second of his three hypostases, Intellect.<a NAME="fnB1" href="#fn1"></a><a HREF="#fn1" name="fnB1">[2]</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier still, according to Damascius (<i>Dubitationes
et Solutiones</i> 61 &amp; 221 = 1.131,17 &amp; 2.101,25 Ruelle), the <i>Chaldaean
Oracles</i> also applied the Existence, Life and Intelligence terminology
to the principal transcendent entities of that system. Between the highest
principle, the Paternal Monad (equated with Existence), and the divine
Intellect, they interposed a median principle they called Hecate. This
Hecate they equated with the processing power of the Paternal Monad, even
though this resulted in a duplication of the figure of Hecate, whom at
a still lower ontological level, they also identified with the World Soul.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now more recently, this Existence, Life and Intellect
triad has turned up in a group (the Platonizing Sethian treatises) of the
Sethian Gnostic treatises from Nag Hammadi, at least two of which, <i>Allogenes</i>

and <i>Zostrianos</i>, were known to Plotinus and his disciple Porphyry
(see Porphyry, <i>Vita Plotini</i> 16). These two treatises, in addition
to a third member of this group, <i>The Three Steles of Seth</i>, equate
a triad Existence, Vitality and Mentality with a figure called the Triple
Powered One. This figure is the link between the supreme principle called
the Unknowable God or the Invisible Spirit and his First Thought or Intellect,
called Barbelo, who is a higher form of Sophia, the divine wisdom. Here,
the Invisible Spirit through its Triple Powered One generates the Aeon
of Barbelo by a static self-extension in which the Triple Powered One,
initially unbounded, proceeds from its source and then turns back upon
it in an act of objectivizing self-knowledge, becoming bounded and taking
on form and definition as Barbelo, the divine Intellect. Intimately related
to these three treatises and especially to <i>Zostrianos</i>, whose author
was probably the first to introduce the Existence, Vitality and Intellect
triad to Sethian theology, is the Sethian <i>Apocryphon of John</i>, ostensibly
our first witness to the complete Gnostic myth of Sophia, the fallen divine
Wisdom as creator and redeemer of this world. Here one finds that the figure
of Barbelo is likewise generated in an act of objectivizing self-knowledge
on the part of the high deity; thereupon she immediately receives the triad
of attributes Foreknowledge, Imperishibility and Eternal Life, a triad
conceptually very close to the triad Existence, Vitality and Mentality
of the Allogenes group and to the triad Existence, Life and Intellect of
the Neoplatonists and the <i>Chaldaean Oracles</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of this article, then, is to explore
the relationships of these triadic figures to one another, in particular
the Sethian triadic figures of the Triple Powered One and Barbelo, and
the triadic figure of Hecate in the <i>Chaldaean Oracles</i>. Each of these
figures is in varying degrees 1) equated with the triad Existence, Life
and Intellect, 2) tends to be regarded as having doubles or cognates elsewhere
in the scale of being, and 3) performs an intermediary function in the
process of the generation of the transcendent world depicted in these various
systems.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One may begin with <i>Allogenes</i>, which is representative
of the metaphysical doctrine of <i>Zostrianos</i> and <i>The Three Steles
of Seth</i>; its doctrine of the Triple Powered One is the crucial feature
by which the treatise can be placed at a definite point in the Platonic
metaphysical tradition. The terminology and the function of this triad
precisely parallel that of the Existence, Life and Intellect triad in the
later Neoplatonists and especially in the anonymous Neoplatonic commentary
on Plato&apos;s <i>Parmenides</i>, which Pierre Hadot has persuasively attributed
to Porphyry, the disciple and biographer of Plotinus.<a NAME="fnB2" href="#fn2"></a><a HREF="#fn2" name="fnB2">[3]</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Platonizing Sethian treatises, the members
of this triad are named Existence (<i>hyparxis</i>) or Being (Greek <i>ousia</i>

or Coptic <i>pet[sinvcircumflex]oop</i> = Greek <i>to on</i> or <i>ontot&ecirc;s</i>),
Life (Coptic <i>p&ocirc;nh</i> = Greek <i>z&ocirc;&ecirc;</i>) or Vitality
(Coptic <i>timnt&ocirc;nh</i> = Greek <i>z&ocirc;ot&ecirc;s</i>) and Mentality
(Coptic <i>timnteime</i> or<i> </i>the Greek neologism <i>no&ecirc;t&ecirc;s</i>),
attributes which the Unknowable deity, although it exists, lives and thinks,
does not itself possess. Generally <i>Allogenes</i> prefers the abstract
nouns Vitality and Mentality to the more concrete substantives Life and
Mind, so as to avoid the implication that any of the terms of the triad
are to be taken as substantial hypostases (cf. Proclus, <i>In Parmenidem</i>

1106,1-1108,19 Cousin). Yet at other times <i>Allogenes</i> employs the
terms Being, Life and Mind, which Plotinus used to describe his hypostasis
of Intellect. Indeed Plotinus seems to have derived his use of the triad
at least in part from Plato&apos;s argument in the <i>Sophist</i> (248C-E) that
true being must also have life and intelligence, as the following passage
describing the generation of Intellect from the One shows:
<ul><font SIZE=-1>Life, not the life of the One, but a trace of it, looking
toward the One was boundless, but once having looked was bounded (without
bounding its source). Life looks toward the One and, determined by it,
takes on boundary, limit and form.... it must then have been determined
(as the life of) a Unity (i.e. Intellect) that includes Multiplicity ...
Multiplicity because of Life, and Unity because of limit.... so Intellect
is bounded Life. (<i>Ennead</i> VI.7.17,13-26)</font></ul>
On the whole, Plotinus tended to conceive Being, Life and Mind as aspects
of his second hypostasis, Mind, owing to his increasing aversion to the
multiplication of the transcendental hypostases beyond three. He regards
the One as entirely transcendent to Intellect; there is no being that exists
between them as a mediator, nor may one distinguish between a higher intellect
in repose and a lower one in motion, or a One in act and another One in
potency (<i>Ennead</i> II.9.1); nor may one distinguish between an intellect
at rest, another in contemplation and yet another that reflects or plans
(<i>Ennead</i> II.9.6) as did Numenius in his <i>Peri t&apos;Agathou</i> (cf.
Numenius, frgg. 11-23 des Places). Since the Triple Powered One in <i>Allogenes</i>

seems to mediate between the Unknowable deity and the next lower hypostasis,
the Aeon of Barbelo, it seems to function either as a One in both potency
and act or perhaps as a higher form of Intellect (i.e. Barbelo). Indeed,
it may have been this doctrine of <i>Allogenes</i> and not just that of
Numenius that provoked Plotinus to place the triad Being, Life and Mind
in the Intellect rather than conjoining it with the One as the link between
these two. The above-quoted passage shows that Plotinus was certainly aware
of the doctrine in his middle period (ca. 263-269) during which Porphyry
attended his seminars. Since he produced it after his antignostic treatise
in which he rejected mediatory principles between the One and the Intellect,
we may surmise that he must have approved of the terminology and function
of the triad, refusing only to accord it separate hypostatic status.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Plotinus strongly separated the One from
the Intellect, most Neoplatonists after him (save possibly Iamblichus)
did not. Less inclined to the rigor of a self-actuated leap to mystical
union, they preferred instead to emphasize the continuity rather than the
discontinuity of the chain of being so as to allow for a more gradual ascent
to the divine, if not even more a smooth path for the descent of the divine
itself into the world. This tendency is nicely demonstrated in the contemporary
exegesis of Plato&apos;s <i>Parmenides</i> in which the One of the first hypothesis
(137D-142A) was identified with the Plotinian One, and the One-who-is of
the second hypothesis (142B-143C) was identified with the intellect, as
in this citation from the anonymous Parmenides commentary:
<ul><font SIZE=-1>The One beyond essence and being is neither being nor
essence nor act, but rather acts and is itself pure act, such that it is
itself pure being <i>einai</i>) before being (<i>to on</i>). By participating
this being (the <i>einai</i> of the One), the One (<i>scil</i>. "who is,"
i.e. the second One) possesses another being declined from it (the <i>einai</i>

of the One), which is to participate being (<i>to on</i>). Thus being is
double: the first preexists being (<i>to on</i>); the second is derived
from the transcendent One who is absolute being (<i>einai</i>) and as it
were the idea of being (<i>to on</i>). (<i>In Parm</i>. XII, 23-33 [Hadot])</font></ul>
One may compare this with the statement concerning the supreme deity in
<i>Allogenes</i> 61,32-39:
<ul><font SIZE=-1>Now it (the Unknowable One) is something insofar as it
exists in that it either exists and will become or &lt;lives> or knows,
although it &lt;acts> without Mind or Life or Existence (<i>hyparxis</i>)
incomprehensibly.</font></ul>

In his article of 1961 and book of 1968,<a NAME="fnB3" href="#fn3"></a><a HREF="#fn3" name="fnB3">[4]</a>
Hadot argues for ascribing the anonymous <i>Parmenides</i> commentary to
Porphyry. In the commentary, the doubleness of being is meant to show how
the supreme One can be both continuous and discontinuous with the Intellect
below it. The One is not simply beyond being (<i>to on</i>), but has a
higher form of purely active being (<i>einai</i> rather than <i>to on</i>)
in which the Intellect merely participates. Likewise, by the use of the
abstracts Existence, Vitality and Mentality, <i>Allogenes</i> also attributes
a purely active being to the Unknowable One.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hadot further shows that the commentator must have
conceived the Intellect as existing in two phases: a first in which Intellect
is still identical with its source the One, and, after its generation from
the One, a second phase in which it has become Intellect itself. In this
self-generation, Existence (<i>hyparxis</i>) is the leading term in a three
stage process. As <i>Anon. Taurensis</i> puts it:
<ul><font SIZE=-1>With respect to [existence (<i>hyparxis</i>) alone] it
(the potential Intellect still identical with the One) is one and simple
... with respect to existence (<i>hyparxis</i>), life (<i>z&ocirc;&ecirc;</i>)
and thought (<i>no&ecirc;sis</i>) it is neither one nor simple. With respect
to existence, thinking is also being thought. But when intellect [abandons]
thought for thinking so as to be elevated to the rank of an intelligible
in order to see itself, thinking is life. Therefore thinking is boundless
with respect to life. And all are activities (<i>energeiai</i>) such that
with respect to existence, activity would be static; with respect to thinking,
activity would be directed to itself; and with respect to life, activity
would be turning away from existence. (<i>In Parm</i>. XIV, 10-26 [Hadot])</font></ul>

So also in <i>Allogenes</i>, the Triple Powered One is identical with the
Invisible Spirit as Existence, and as Mentality it is discontinuous with
the Invisible Spirit, but now identical with Barbelo. But as Vitality,
the Triple Powered One can be regarded as discontinuous with both, which
is why <i>Allogenes</i> tends to represent the Triple Powered One as an
independent hypostasis, but sometimes names it now in conjunction with
the Invisible Spirit (as in 47,8- 9; 51,8-9; 58,25; 66,33-34) and now in
conjunction with Barbelo (as in 64,34- 36). Thus the ontological status
of the Triple Powered One is very close to that of the Life modality of
the potential intellect in its procession from the One as described in
the <i>Parmenides</i> commentary. In fact, <i>Allogenes</i> (66,32-36)
explicitly identifies the Triple Powered One with "Eternal Life."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That <i>Allogenes</i> calls the leading term in
the emanative process both Existence (<i>hyparxis</i>) and Being (<i>to
on</i>) seems to show that this treatise trades in the same terminology
familiar to Plotinus on the one hand and the commentator on the other.
The additional fact that Plotinus reacted against the notion of an Intellect
consisting of several distinct levels and surely would be ill-disposed
to the location of a triad latent within the One or between the One and
the Intellect suggests that the scheme of <i>Allogenes</i>, and not only
that of Numenius and others, was likely one of those so strongly criticized
by Plotinus. The similarity between the schemes of <i>Allogenes</i> and
of the <i>Parmenides</i> commentary may indicate that the commentator could
have derived his scheme as much from <i>Allogenes</i> as from Plotinus
or Numenius or especially the <i>Chaldaean Oracles</i> which are in fact
cited in the commentary. By contrast with these professional philosophers,
the rather unsystematic character of the presentation of the metaphysical
scheme in <i>Allogenes</i> may owe not simply to garbled imitation or a
desire to reconcile his metaphysics with the traditional Sethian mythologies,
but may also quite likely owe to the author&apos;s originality. That is, <i>Allogenes</i>

and/or the <i>Commentary </i>may have been an important catalyst and conceptual
source to Plotinus, no matter how unacceptable certain other of its features
may have been to him. Since the author of <i>Allogenes</i> is quite capable
of accurate citation of his sources (e.g. his citation from the negative
theology of the <i>Apocryphon of John</i>: BG 8502, <i>2</i>:23,3-26,13
= NHC II,<i>1</i>:3:18-25 = <i>Allogenes</i> 62,28- 63,23), the unsystematic
character of his metaphysics more likely owes to his originality than to
confusion or misappropriation of the doctrine of Plotinus. And the fact
that <i>Allogenes</i> was read in Plotinus&apos; circle tends to add weight
to this likelihood.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In sum, the fact that revelations under the name
of "Allogenes," "Messos," "Zostrianos" and "Zoroaster" (Porphyry, <i>Vita
Plot</i>. 16) circulated in and were refuted in Plotinus&apos; seminars, coupled
with the fact that the doctrines refuted by Plotinus in <i>Ennead</i> II.9
are so close to those of the Platonizing Sethian treatises, seems to suggest
that the Neoplatonists are more likely dependent on the Sethian "Platonists"
than the reverse. If so, treatises like <i>Zostrianos</i> and <i>Allogenes</i>
would have been produced at a point prior to Plotinus&apos; antignostic polemic
of the years 263-269 (<i>Enneads</i> III.8, V.8, V.5 and II.9 [chronologically
30-33] as identified by R. Harder).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what now can be said of the sources of the metaphysical
doctrine of <i>Allogenes</i>? Recalling the strikingly close doctrinal
and terminological similarity between <i>Allogenes</i> and the <i>Parmenides</i>

commentary, and the fact that the commentary cites the <i>Chaldaean Oracles</i>,
one may logically consider the Oracles as a possible source upon which
the authors of <i>Zostrianos</i> and <i>Allogenes</i> drew. In addition
to the Oracles, however, one must also consider the metaphysical scheme
presented in the early Sethian work <i>The Apocryphon of John</i>, since,
as mentioned above, the author of <i>Allogenes</i> explicitly cited a passage
from that work. As possible sources for the concept the Triple Powered
One of <i>Allogenes</i>, then, we will consider first the <i>Oracles</i>

with their doctrine of Hecate, and then the <i>Apocryphon of John</i> with
its doctrine of Barbelo.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>Chaldaean Oracles</i> are roughly contemporary
with Numenius, being attributed to Julian the Theurgist who was credited
with a miraculous deliverance of Marcus Aurelius&apos; troops in 173 CE. The
Oracles exhibit a hierarchical system with many Neopythagorean features.
The supreme god is called Father, Bythos, (frg. 18 des Places) and the
Paternal Monad; he is totally transcendent, having nothing to do with creation,
and can be apprehended only with the "flower of the mind," a non-knowing,
mentally vacant mode of contemplation (frgg. 1 &amp; 18 des Places, the
same doctrine as is found in <i>Allogenes</i>). This supreme Father is
presumably beyond being (as <i>hapax epekeina</i>), but also consists of
a triad comprising himself or his existence (<i>hyparxis</i>, Damascius,

<i>Dub. et Sol</i>. 61, p.131,17 Ruelle; cf. frg. 1 line 10 des Places),
his power and his intellect. Below him is the demiurgic Intellect proceeding
from the Father who himself remains aloof, confining himself along with
his intellect and his power, but apparently not confining his "fire" or
proceeding intellect (frgg. 3,4 &amp; 5 des Places). The actual hypostatic
Intellect of this system is a demiurgical Intellect and is called a Dyad,
contemplating the intelligible realm of the Father&apos;s intellect and bringing
sense perception to the world (much like the second God of Numenius; cf.
frgg. 7 &amp; 8 des Places). Furthermore, this Intellect, said to be "dyadically
transcendent" (<i>dis epekeina</i>), is also triadic insofar as it contains
the "measured triad" flowing from both it and the triadic Father (frgg.
23-31 des Places). But this "measured triad" also seems to be identified
with Hecate, who is called a "membrane" which separates the first and second
fires (frg. 6 des Places), i.e. the Father and the Intellect (frg. 50 des
Places). Furthermore, from the right side of Hecate flows the primordial
soul, while her left side retains the source of virtue; upon her back the
emblem of the moon (the traditional symbol of Hecate) represents boundless
Nature, and her serpentine hair represents the Father&apos;s winding noetic
fire (frgg.50-55 des Places). Indeed, Hecate&apos;s triform nature (three heads,
six arms) is well- known from antiquity. She is guardian of forks in the
road and is identified with the three phases of the moon. According to
Hesiod (<i>Theogony</i> 412-428), Hecate is awarded three cosmic spheres
of influence (earth, sea, sky) first by the Titans in the old order and
then by Zeus in the new, and she also exercises influence over the world
of men in the Indo-European trifunctional spheres of sovereignty, force
and productivity.<a NAME="fnB4" href="#fn4"></a><a HREF="#fn4" name="fnB4">[5]</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Hellenistic period, Hecate becomes goddess
of heaven, earth, and especially of the underworld. In the <i>Oracles</i>,
she may also be at times equated with the World Soul of which she is the
source, suggesting that, much like the relationship between Barbelo and
Sophia in Sethian theology, Hecate was understood by the Chaldaeans as
being the transcendent World Soul who generates the immanent World Soul,
from which in turn was derived the world of Nature. And finally, Hecate
may have been identified as well with the median term of the triad existence,
power and intellect which characterized the supreme Father.<a NAME="fnB5" href="#fn5"></a><a HREF="#fn5" name="fnB5">[6]</a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus in effect, the <i>Oracles</i> depict an ennead:
a first triad of the Father together with his power and potential intellect;
a third triad of the dyadically oriented (above and below) demiurgic Intellect;
and between these two a second "measured triad" identified with Hecate
representing the multiplicity that proceeds from the Father. Indeed, there
is a certain parallel between the Sethian Triple Powered One and the Chaldaean
Hecate, in terms both of emanative and intermediary functions, in terms
of a common triplicity, and in terms of a strong association of both with
Vitality and the source of Life and multiplicity.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When one turns to the still earlier Sethian <i>Apocryphon
of John</i>, probably datable to the first quarter of the second century
and excerpted already by Irenaeus (<i>Haer</i>. I.29) around 179 CE, one
encounters the triadic feminine intermediary goddess once again in the
figure of Barbelo, the higher unfallen counterpart of Sophia, the fallen
divine wisdom. Here Barbelo is the first emanation of the supreme deity,
the Invisible Spirit, who reflected upon himself as light and living water,
whereupon his thought manifested itself as Barbelo. Immediately the bisexual
Barbelo requested and was granted a triad of attributes, Foreknowledge
(<i>progn&ocirc;sis</i>), Imperishability (<i>aphtharsia</i>) and Eternal
Life (<i>ai&ocirc;nia z&ocirc;&ecirc;</i>). Since these names are conceptually
close to the terms Existence or Being, Life or Vitality and Mind or Mentality
applied to the Triple Powered One in <i>Allogenes</i>, and since <i>Allogenes</i>

indeed demonstrates dependence upon <i>The Apocryphon of John</i>, it is
reasonable to conclude that there is some relationship between these two
triads.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An educated guess would be that the author of <i>Allogenes</i>
was familiar with contemporary Platonic speculation on the relationship
between being, life and mind or thought already directly discussed in Plato&apos;s
<i>Sophist</i>, and applied it to his own interpretation of the figure
of Barbelo in <i>The Apocryphon of John</i>. He may even have been familiar
with the metaphysical system of the <i>Chaldaean Oracles</i> and perhaps
have recognized from the <i>Oracles</i> or elsewhere a certain similarity
between the triadic nature and function of Hecate and the triadic nature
and function of Barbelo in <i>The Apocryphon of John</i>. In this connection,
one should note that <i>Allogenes</i> distinguishes three levels in the
Aeon of Barbelo: Kalyptos (Hidden), Protophanes (First-appearing) and Autogenes
(Self-begotten). One may wonder whether these terms may in part have been
inspired by the three forms of Hecate symbolizing the three phases of the
moon, at first hidden, then first appearing and growing to fullness as
a self-begotten being. As for his metaphysical portrayal of the emanative
process by which Barbelo emerges from the Invisible Spirit via the Triple
Powered One, he may even have been familiar with the late first century
system of Moderatus of Gades, according to which a secondary One or unitary
Logos functioning as the divine Intellect emanates from a first One beyond
all being in three stages: Permanence (<i>mon&ecirc;</i>), Progression
(<i>propodismos</i>) and a Return (<i>anapodismos</i>) upon its source.<a NAME="fnB6" href="#fn6"></a><a HREF="#fn6" name="fnB6">[7]</a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first and second centuries, Neopythagoreanizing
Platonists like Moderatus developed speculative arithmologies which among
other things attempted to derive the physical world of multiplicity from
a single prior principle by supposing that a triad resided latently within
the primal monad. According to Theon of Smyrna in the early second century:
"First exists the Monad, called a triangular number not in full actuality,
... but rather potentially, for, since it is, as it were, the seed of all
things, it contains in itself also a triform potency" (<i>Expositio</i>
37,15-18 Hiller). So also Theon&apos;s contemporary, Nicomachus of Gerasa wrote:
"Thus the Monad appears also potentially a triangular number, although
in actuality the first (triangular number) is three" (<i>Eisagog&ecirc;</i>
II.8 p.88,9-10 Hoche). Presumably all this speculation about the first
three or four numbers goes back to the early Pythagoreans and the Old Academy
under Plato and Speusippus, who applied the Pythagorean Tetraktys to their
own cosmological theories.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strictly speaking, of the triadic figures so far
discussed, only the Triple Powered One and Hecate actually mediate the
original emanative process itself; in the Sethian scheme, Barbelo is, after
all, only the product of this original emanation. But the place of Barbelo
in these considerations is important, for she serves as the fundamental
mediator in the Sethian soteriology, and, in <i>Allogenes</i>, the first
stage of the visionary ascent to the Unknowable deity is the ascent through
the three levels of her Aeon, which are named Autogenes, Protophanes and
Kalyptos. To know them is to know the Aeon of Barbelo, and to know Barbelo
is the prelude to the ascent through the Mentality, Vitality and Existence
levels of the Triple Powered One, at which point one gains the mentally
vacant primary revelation of the Unknowable deity.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A final point to consider is the role in all this
of the prominent Sethian Father, Mother, Son triad. The Father, Mother,
Son nomenclature of this triad and its transcendental status seem to derive
from Plato&apos;s <i>Timaeus</i> 50D. The characterization of its members has
been influenced by later Jewish and early Sethian speculation on the first
five chapters of Genesis according to which the image in which the earthly
Adam or man is made as male and female must itself be the archetypal Adam
(Adamas) or Man, who must be likewise androgynous. That is, God created
man as male and female in his own image, which can be taken to mean that
he too is androgynous. The earthly man is later separated into distinct
male and female beings, Adam and Eve, yet the archetypal man, who is none
other than God himself, is not so separated, but can be spiritually conceived
as male and female. In this sense, the supreme deity is Man proper, and
the earthly Adam, although initially unaware of it, is the Son of Man.
Once Adam is enlightened concerning his true nature by Eve, his female
counterpart, the primordial couple conceive Seth, their spiritual offspring,
who will be the father of the "unshakable race" of the Sethian Gnostics.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Sethian system, then, both Eve and Sophia
are mother figures; Eve, of Seth, and Sophia of the demiurge who creates
the physical world. In this sense, Sophia, the divine wisdom could, as
mother, be considered as the consort of the supreme deity Man, but she
is disqualified because she conceived the world creator alone, without
a consort. Therefore, since Sophia is disqualified, the supreme deity is
supplied with a higher, unfallen equivalent of Sophia as his consort, who
in the Sethian system is Barbelo, the androgynous Mother-father of the
All, the thought (<i>ennoia</i>) of the supreme deity. Finally, to complete
the system, a distinction is made between 1) the earthly Adam, as son of
the demiurge, 2) the image of God in which he was made, and 3) the supreme
deity, such that the Sethian system came to comprise a highest Father,
Mother, Son triad consisting of the Invisible Spirit, Barbelo, and Adamas
or Autogenes, the self-begotten son of Barbelo. In turn, Adamas, the Son
figure, became the image according to which the demiurge fashioned the
earthly Adam. Subsequent to his enlightenment, Adam begot Seth, whom therefore
the Sethians can call the Triple Male Child.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus in Sethianism, one ends up with a rather convoluted
series of four fathers, the Invisible Spirit, Adamas (or Geradamas), Adam,
and Seth, and three sons descended from the supreme deity Man, namely Adamas,
Adam, and Seth. Correspondingly, this scheme also requires three mothers,
Barbelo, Sophia, and Eve, all counterparts of one another. Of these, only
Barbelo is represented as triadic, since, in addition to her male and female
aspects, her son Autogenes is self-begotten from her and thus was potentially
a part of her originally. Based on this line of development, one might
further speculate that the position of the Triple Powered One in <i>Allogenes</i>
is in part a further attempt at transcendental duplication of the Sethian
Father, Mother, Son triad, since the term Being, although of neuter gender,
thus transcending sexual differentiation, is in some sense logically prior
to Life and Intelligence, while Life, of feminine gender, depends on Being
and is requisite to the existence of the third term, Intelligence, of masculine
gender. While this insight may have played a role in the development of
the system of <i>Allogenes</i>, it is clear that in our present version
of this treatise, the three, Being, Life and Intelligence, are all seen
as mutually interdependent (cf. <i>Allogenes</i> 49,28-36 and Proclus,
<i>Elements of Theology</i> 103 p.92,13-16 Dodds).

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In one way or another, the three triadic beings
whose prominent role in the emanative process we have here considered are
each closely associated with the concept of Life and Vitality. The median
term of the Sethian Triple Powered One is explicitly named Life or Vitality,
while the third of Barbelo&apos;s principal attributes is named Eternal Life.
And in the case of Hecate, we have noted that the Chaldaeans regarded her
right side as the source of the primordial soul that animates the realms
of light, divine fire, ether and the heavens (frg. 51 des Places). In this
capacity, both Hecate and Barbelo are characterized as cosmic wombs. Of
these two, only Barbelo is explicitly said to be androgynous, but it is
clear that they were both conceived in predominantly feminine terms. The
Triple Powered One, although its name is masculine, comprises three aspects,
and depending on the terminology used, either one (in the case of the Being,
Life and Intellect terminology) or all three (in the case of the Existence,
Vitality and Mentality terminology) of its three aspects bear names in
the feminine gender. But in all cases the median aspect of these three
figures is feminine, according well with their role as the feminine mediators
of theogonical generation. No doubt, much of this may also be influenced
by Plato&apos;s doctrine of the receptacle of becoming in <i>Timaeus</i> 48E-52D.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly this complicated system built on a gnostic
exegesis of the Genesis presentation of the procreation of the primal beings
would, in a Platonizing environment, lend itself easily to arithmological
and metaphysical speculation. In this way the ancient traditions of Platonism,
(Neo-)Pythagoreanism, and heterodox Judaism could all mutually confirm
one another in the Sethian mind. As for the position of Hecate in the Chaldaean
system, similar considerations also apply, since the figure of the three-formed
Hecate is of great antiquity itself, from which time she was considered
as a beneficial goddess of the moon and later on of the Underworld, whence
she derived her power to make spells and other magical devices effective.
<p>Finally, it is interesting that these three triadic figures all have
something to do with the concept of dynamic emanationism in one way or
another. The Triple Powered One and Hecate are vehicles or mediators of
the emanative process, while Barbelo is a direct result of it. One may
indeed wonder whether the concept of dynamic emanationism entered Platonism
during the first and second centuries (and permanently so with Plotinus)
directly as a result of the combination of gnostic theogonies with Neopythagorean
arithmological speculation. Certainly the theogony of the Platonizing Sethian
treatises seems to suggest this. In all events, I hope to have pointed
out some interesting relationships and lines of development among the Sethian,
Chaldaean and Neoplatonic theogonies that employ the concept of dynamic
emanationism.&nbsp;
