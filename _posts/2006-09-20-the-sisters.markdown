My blessed wife was once one of the few female members of the Sisters of
Perpetual Indulgence, a queer organization composed largely of gay men.
Earlier today, she posted a [photo
set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rerlin/sets/72157594291961420/) from
her old albums including the photo below.

*R is on the right here...* But wait...there's more! It isn't just my
wife. The wonderful Rubylou is also a former sister from the same era. I
have the following old pic of her as well.
![image](http://www.zhangzhung.net/pics/rl.jpg) How I, one of the most
mundane straight men in the world, wound up dating **two** different
queer girls who had been in the Sisters, I will never understand. I
guess I attract the freaky ones. :-)
