<p>When you watch your old tomcat walk into furniture repeatedly, it doesn't  take long to realize that maybe he can't see...</p> <p>Pollux, whom most of my friends have met over the years, seems to be blind  now. He's walking around and stopping when his whiskers encounter something. He  still seems to know his way around the house so diagnosis has been difficult.  When you wave a finger about a centimeter in front of a cat's eyeball  repeatedly, you do get a definite impression that he isn't seeing though.</p> <p>I think this has happened over the last couple of weeks. We've noticed that  he's looked a bit like Puss 'n Boots in Shrek 2 recently. By this, I mean that  his eyes look very large. I realized today that it is because his pupils seem to  be dilated almost all of the way open all of the time. I've only seen them close  down a bit when he has faced into direct sunlight. It isn't normal for a cat's  eyes to be open to that degree in normal light. That's night vision mode in my  experience.</p> <p>After some testing, it seems that he may be seeing some light and shadow with  at least his right eye but I'm not entirely sure. This strikes me as possibly a  good reason to take him to the vet. I don't know for sure that this came on  suddenly but it seems that way and that could mean that there are other  problems.</p> <p align="center"><img src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/pollux-colors.jpg" border="1" width="255" height="315"></p>
