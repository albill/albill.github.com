Monk does Prison work as a sponsor for pagans at McNeil Island, a men's prison here in Washington. I've begun talking to him about becoming a sponsor as well in support of the pagan group there. That would mean going out there possibly a couple of times a month to meet with them and support them in their spiritual work.

I need to get more information overall but I gave Monk my personal information so the background check necessary for this could be run. If all goes well, I may go out on November 1 for their Samhain get-together.
