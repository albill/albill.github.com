The Rubin Museum of Art in New York City has been doing an exhibit of Buddhist mandalas recently. I just found today that they put a selection of these online on Flickr.

I've included a Manushri mandala below. You should check out the whole <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rmanyc/sets/72157619567768925/">set</a> if you're interested in things like this.
