Fake Grant Morrison Interview

This is amusing as all hell. I wish they'd do Warren Ellis.

This is just an excerpt:

> **Paul Gravett:**
>
> As do I. As do I. I must say, I’m very curious as to your plans for
> the future in comics. Do you have more magical acts in the works?
>
> **Grant Morrison:**
>
> Of course. I’m actually making plans for my grandest scheme yet.
>
> **Paul Gravett:**
>
> What can you tell us about it?
>
> **Grant Morrison:**
>
> Ahem. Well. My plan is to turn the DC Universe into a sentient being.
>
> **Paul Gravett:**
>
> Errrr…
>
> **Grant Morrison:**
>
> You heard me correctly.
>
> **Paul Gravett:**
>
> I understand each of the individual words, but I’m not sure what they
> mean next to each other.
>
> **Grant Morrison:**
>
> It’s hard to explain…
>
> **Paul Gravett:**
>
> Because of the complexity?
>
> **Grant Morrison:**
>
> Because I’m coming onto the Acid and the hash twinkies. But I’ll give
> it a shot.
>
> You see, Paul, I think of the DC Universe as fulfilling many of the
> requirements of a living thing. It grows, it changes over time, it
> reacts to its environment. In fact, considering that the creations in
> the DC Universe have outlived many of their creators, you could say
> that the DC Universe is more alive than we are, something that will
> continue to exist long after you and I are dead.
>
> **Paul Gravett:**
>
> All right.
>
> **Grant Morrison:**
>
> Now, although it is alive, it isn’t what we would call conscious. It
> growth and its actions are essentially reactive, like a plant, or an
> oyster, or John Byrne.
>
> **Paul Gravett:**
>
> I see.
>
> **Grant Morrison:**
>
> Unlike the oyster or John Byrne, this isn’t because the DC Universe
> lacks sufficient complexity. Its level of complexity, as you might
> expect after sixty years of monthly development and refinement, is
> staggering.
>
> What I plan to do is, much in the same way a crucial lightning bolt
> hit the primordial soup and started the chain reaction which created
> life as we know it, write a comic series that will bring the DC
> Universe to consciousness. To wake up an entity that is largely
> dormant. My belief is that this is very similar to the way our
> universe was created. We existed largely as a fiction that became
> sufficiently complex, and then a final story gave us our independence
> and brought us to consciousness.
>
> **Paul Gravett:**
>
> Absolutely fascinating.
>
> **Grant Morrison:**
>
> Thank you. This is the point where somebody’s supposed to jump up and
> yell “He’s absolutely mad!” and then a bunch of villagers chase me
> with burning torches to an abandoned windmill.
>
> **Paul Gravett:**
>
> Well, it’s still a little early for that, Grant. Tell me, after you
> manage to turn the DC Universe into an individually cognizant being,
> what then?
>
> **Grant Morrison:**
>
> What then?
>
> **Paul Gravett:**
>
> Yes. What do you plan to do with an living comic book universe
>
> **Grant Morrison:**
>
> I plan to have sex with it.
