<p>R and I went to our friend Brandy Williams&#39; (<a href="http://www.brandywilliams.org/">http://www.brandywilliams.org/</a>) 
book release party last night for her new book. This was on Capitol Hill in 
Seattle. I bought R a copy of the book for Christmas and she&#39;s begun reading it 
lately. I may use some of the exercises in it with the guys for the prison 
Wiccan work that I do.</p>
<p>While there, we ran into a friend from Portland, who decided to attend. She 
was visiting another friend in town and she introduced me to some of the other 
Reclaiming people that she knows locally. Sarastro and Sunnie were there as well 
as a few other locals that we know. Afterwards, Sarastro, Sunnie, R and I went 
to a Thai restaurant down the street and had fairly good food and chatted for a 
while.</p>
<p>I&#39;m feeling a bit under the weather so I&#39;m wondering if either Scott (<a href="http://www.scottstearns.com">http://www.scottstearns.com</a>) 
or the Dread Pirate Doug gave me one of their many diseases this week. For the 
majority of the last two days at work, we attended leadership training that was 
organized by the head of our group. They took a number of different classes or 
exercises and did a kind of &quot;best of&quot; program in order to help raise the 
leadership skill in our organization. Overall, I felt that the classes were 
fairly useful but it takes a lot out of people to sit in training for five hours 
one day and about eight the next day. The first day I was sitting at the &quot;sick&quot; 
table so I wonder if I picked up something...</p>
<p>Monday will be an internal test conference at work which leaves me feeling a 
bit under the gun if I want to keep up on what&#39;s going on but not be working on 
e-mail from home all weekend or something.</p>
<p>I did pick up <b>World of Warcraft</b> this week after <i>certain</i> 
coworkers kept telling me how cool it is to play. I must admit, as massively 
multiplayer games go, it is actually pretty good. I haven&#39;t felt like I was 
simply killing bunnies for forever like <b>Asheron&#39;s Call</b> and others made me 
feel. I have to ration my play a bit since I am still studying and preparing to 
write papers for my degree program and I can&#39;t allow work or playing online 
games to let me get behind. It&#39;s fun enough though.</p>
