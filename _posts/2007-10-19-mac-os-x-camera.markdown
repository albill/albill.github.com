I have a Mac Pro (aka the "Cheese Grater") at home. My laptop is a
Macbook and has a built-in camera for chat, etc. but the Mac Pro does
not. This has caused me no end of annoyances at times. Apple used to
make the standalone iSight cameras but they have discontinued it. This
is what we use at Mozilla when we want to do webcasting or use iChat in
our meeting rooms (which each have one). In my opinion, the resolution
on them is a little low at 640x480 anyway. I have a Microsoft LifeCam
VX-6000 with a 1.3 megapixel video resolution but, of course, there are
no drivers for OS X for it. (And, yes, I know of the third party
projects to make drivers for other web cameras but they still don't
support the VX-6000). I'm looking for two suggestions:

1.  A webcam that does at least 640x480 that works easily in OS X and is
    less than $100.
2.  A **good** webcam with a 1+ megapixel video resolution that works in
    OS X.

We do a certain amount of chat at Mozilla and I work from home a bit of
the time. I'd also like to do the occasional talking head thing here on
my blog. Then [I can all over the
intarweb](http://www.arcanology.com/2007/10/18/web-20-live-cam-whoring-and-you/)
like [Asa](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/) or [Chris
Messina](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2007/05/10/thoughts-on-mozilla/).
**Update from 11/1**: I wound up getting a [Live! Cam Optia
AF](http://www.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=218&subcategory=219&product=16425&bypass=1)
from Creative Labs. This is a two megapixel webcam that works out of the
box on OS X and comes with Windows drivers/software (which is useful
since I use Bootcamp to boot into Vista as well).
