So, I went to bed late and woke up earlier than I had been on vacation.
The net result of such things, of course, is that I woke up in the
middle of my dream cycle. Normally, I don't remember most of my dreams.
I've never made a point of recording them though I've thought about
doing so for years. What was I dreaming of when I woke up? Sugarplum
fairies dancing in my head. **No.** I was dreaming of my ex-lover, the
one from my last longterm relationship before R. The one that ended so
painfully and badly. There I was, in my dream, back in the house we
lived in with her spouse (it was a poly relationship, a 'v' when it was
anything). It was now but it was also then. I remember talking to him
about the Two Towers movie. I remember sitting on her bed with her and
talking and then being pushed away... What a fucked up thing to wake up
to on Christmas Day. I woke up upset, angry and sad together, from it
when the alarm went off. You'd think that after almost three years, I'd
be well over it and the wounds healed or at least scarred over enough
that I wouldn't have dreams like this. Off to my grandparents' now!
