<h2>Meditation study aims to leap over mental barriers</h2>
<h3>By Carrie Peyton Dahlberg, Sacramento Bee Staff Writer, November 29, 2004</h3>
<p><strong>Sacramento, CA (USA)</strong> -- For more than a year, researchers at 
UC Davis have been trying to find the best way to frame a provocative question: 
How good can human beings get - how focused, how calm, how kind?</p>
<p>In seeking the answer, they plan to use an audacious tool. Think of it as a 
little like brain science meets reality television.</p>
<p>They will gather 30 people for a yearlong meditation retreat and then watch 
what happens.</p>
<p>With electroencephalogram (EEG) caps, attention measurements, emotion testing 
and a form of meditation practice called Shamatha, researchers hope to answer a 
key question about the brain systems that regulate attention and emotion. How 
much can those systems change with effort, how much - in the Silly Putty 
neuroscience term applied to our malleable brains - is plasticity at work?</p>
<p>&quot;Is attention plastic? We have a hunch that it&#39;s trainable, but there is very 
limited research on training of attention,&quot; said Clifford Saron, an assistant 
research scientist at UC Davis&#39; Center for Mind and Brain.</p>
<p>Saron is coordinating the project, which at this early stage is already a 
simmering esoteric brew.</p>
<p>There is the encouraging note from the Dalai Lama&#39;s personal secretary. There 
is a French filmmaker who wants to chronicle the effort for her &quot;Monks in the 
Lab&quot; documentary. There is seed money from the Santa Barbara Institute for 
Consciousness Studies, which got it through a donation from actor Richard Gere.</p>
<p>And there is interest from other researchers, who have seen the project 
mentioned in the journal Science or heard about its scope through the grapevine.</p>

<p>&quot;We have people clapping us on the back,&#39; &quot; said G. Ron Mangun, head of the 
Center for Mind and Brain. &quot;It&#39;s like when you say, &#39;Well, I want to go to the 
moon,&#39; and they say, &#39;Well yeah, it&#39;s gotta be done. ... Good luck, pal.&#39; &quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Bennett Shapiro, who follows meditation research as a board member of the 
Mind and Life Institute, a collaboration of scientists and Buddhists, calls the 
upcoming study &quot;pioneering work.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s uncommon to sequester 30 people for a year and probe them so 
intensively, said Shapiro, a retired physician.</p>
<p>At least another 30 people will be monitored equally closely as a control 
group, although they won&#39;t be taken away from their daily lives.</p>
<p>Researchers will look for differences between the groups as meditators are 
trained in a technique of refining their attention that has its roots in India 
and is known in Tibet as Shamatha.</p>
<p>The claims for Shamatha - that its practitioners can increase the stability 
and vividness of their attention as a way to improve their emotional balance - 
makes it especially fascinating for some neuroscientists.</p>
<p>Attention is vital to who we are and how we cope with the world.</p>
<p>The act of paying attention to something, picking it out of the stream of 
sensations that bombards our brains, is critical to remembering it, said Ewa 
Wojcuilik, a UC Davis assistant professor who specializes in visual attention.</p>
<p>But paying attention can be tough. Give people something simple and boring to 
do, and their distractibility zooms. Ask them to be alert to small, sporadic 
changes in a stream of data, and they manage for 10 or 20 minutes, then fumble 
badly.</p>
<p>But is this truly the best we can do, or can some specially trained 
individuals go further, breaking through mental barriers the way Olympic 
athletes surge past physical ones?</p>
<p>&quot;Within the science of attention, we have formed certain ideas about what our 
limits are,&quot; Wojcuilik said. &quot;If the cognitive apparatus can be pushed beyond 
what we expect ... we are on to a new beginning.&quot;</p>
<p>She is among more than a dozen researchers who have met regularly to design 
the Shamatha project, a collaboration of a half-dozen arms of UC Davis and the 
Santa Barbara Institute for Consciousness Studies.</p>
<p>While the group&#39;s primary focus is on attention, it also will explore whether 
meditators become calmer, kinder and more compassionate, as tradition holds.</p>
<p>Phil Shaver, who chairs the UC Davis psychology department and specializes in 
the study of emotions, will look at how quickly meditators get their equilibrium 
back after viewing upsetting movie scenes, whether disturbing words disrupt 
their focus and whether their health seems to indicate lower stress.</p>
<p>With the team still nearly two years away from its target start date of Sept. 
22, 2006 - the autumnal equinox - many details remain to be resolved, but some 
general outlines are emerging.</p>
<p>B. Alan Wallace, who has trained as a Buddhist monk and has a doctorate in 
religious studies from Stanford, will take 30 people to some quiet corner of 
California.</p>
<p>There, they will rise at 6 a.m. for cycles of group and private meditation 
that continue until 10 p.m., punctuated by silent meals and a couple of two-hour 
breaks of unstructured time.</p>
<p>Their goal will be to cultivate a stable, vivid attention, because &quot;this is 
going to bring you to a much, much higher platform of mental balance, mental 
well-being,&quot; Wallace said.</p>
<p>Wallace, who heads the Santa Barbara institute, has recruited participants 
from shorter retreats he leads in Europe, Mexico and the United States.</p>
<p>They will be people with a contemplative bent, eager to pay $1,000 a month to 
be sequestered for a year, away from homes and jobs, family and friends, to 
explore the reaches of their own consciousness.</p>
<p>As often as every two weeks, live-in research assistants will take some study 
participants to an on-site lab to probe their minds and hearts, their health and 
behaviors.</p>
<p>Their performance will be tracked on standard attention tasks and on some 
created specifically for the project.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they&#39;ll be plugged into EEG caps that monitor electrical impulses 
in their brains, listening to the simultaneous firing of millions of nerve 
cells. Their blood or saliva will be checked for stress hormones and their 
immune systems subjected to allergens to see how robustly they respond.</p>
<p>And in a twist that brings a whiff of being voted off the island, they may be 
asked to report on each other, assessing who is the most compassionate or how 
fellow participants&#39; behaviors change over time.</p>
<p>With so many measures, over so many months, &quot;you&#39;re going to have a very, 
very rich data set,&quot; said Emilio Ferrer, an assistant professor whose 
specialties include quantitative psychology.</p>
<p>First, though, the research team has more groundwork ahead, in refining the 
experimental design, conducting pilot studies and nailing down funding. The team 
is hoping to raise $1.5 million to $2 million from foundations, the National 
Institutes of Health and donors.</p>
<p>While the thrust of the project is pure science, simply to learn what a 
highly trained brain may be capable of, it someday could have implications for 
attention deficit disorders or other ills - if the project finds that training 
can make a difference.</p>
<p>It is a big if.</p>
<p>&quot;Most research comes to naught. That&#39;s the rule. Getting definitive results 
is the exception,&quot; said Paul Ekman, an expert on emotional expression and 
deception.</p>
<p>&quot;This is really an extremely exciting adventure that UC Davis is taking,&quot; he 
said. &quot;This collaboration between top-rank neuroscientists, psychologists 
concerned with behavior and a Buddhist scholar and practitioner is in many ways 
quite unique.</p>
<p>&quot;We don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going to be productive, but if you knew it was going 
to be productive, then it wouldn&#39;t be exciting.&quot;</p>
