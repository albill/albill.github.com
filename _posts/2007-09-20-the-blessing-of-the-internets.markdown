My friend, [Nathan](http://technosattva.org/), recently hosted teachings
by a Tibetan Lama, [Lama
Samten](http://www.kagyu.org/kagyulineage/teachers/tea28.php), in
Seattle. At the teachings, Nathan asked Lama Samten if he'd be
interested in blessing the servers at the data center he does work
within. Samten agreed and Nathan worked with the others at the service
provider to set things up. A week and a half later, Nathan and the
others took Lama Samten to the Westin building in Seattle. While there,
Lama Samten did a blessing ceremony to bless both the servers and,
through them, the Internet as a whole. Nathan has posted pictures on his
[Picasa
gallery](http://picasaweb.google.com/nagardner/200709LamaSamtenBlessesTheInternets),
of which I have a few excerpts below:

So, the Internet is now blessed. Be good.
