I have a small Wiki set up for one of the spiritual groups that I work with  and I'm starting to maintain one at my work. They are fairly fun and I enjoy the  group collaboration aspect of it as social software. I found this at the Seattle  PI at <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/158020_msftnotebook26.html">http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/158020_msftnotebook26.html</a> for  sharing.

To Microsoft's roster of employees, add the inventor of the wiki.

A wiki? Unless you're heavily into the Internet, chances are you're wondering  what the heck that is.

The wiki concept was created by Ward Cunningham, who joined Microsoft last  month after working as a consultant to the company. Cunningham set out in 1995  to create a unique online site for people involved in technical aspects of a  type of software development known as object-oriented programming.

A wiki is a computer program that lets people around the world collaborate to  create and update Web pages. The resulting collections of pages are also known  as wikis. But there's more to it than that. Anyone who reads a wiki -- yes,  anyone -- can also easily make changes, corrections and additions, create whole  new pages, and even correct the way the wiki is organized.

"It took a while for this to catch on because it sounded so unusual, but I've  now got 25,000 pages about programming up on that site," Cunningham said last  week.
