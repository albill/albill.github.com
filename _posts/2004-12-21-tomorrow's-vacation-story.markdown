Tomorrow's vacation story will be "hey, this 'service engine soon' light just came on. I wonder if it is important..." This is also known as "My car has 59,000 miles, makes a funny whirring sound in the fans when I turn the defrost on, and now has a new interior light." R is following me to visit Steve, my mechanic (who used to own "Al's Auto," go figure), in the morning. He asked me if he could have it all day tomorrow. My thought was "My wife is working all day and you live three miles or so from me...fuck if I'm coming to get it before six anyway." Yes, vacation is a dream of relaxation.
