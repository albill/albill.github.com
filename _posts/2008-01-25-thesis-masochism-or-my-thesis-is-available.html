It is with only a minor feeling of dread that I make this announcement: For the few that have an interest in my Master's thesis, I've made a book form of it available on lulu.com.
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/2219762370/" title="Thesis Book Cover by albill, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2217/2219762370_c08a0a2cf1_o.png" width="328" height="525" alt="Thesis Book Cover" /></a></p>
It is relatively short because of the guidelines for my program and I could have gone on at much greater length (ask me sometime about the twenty page fifth chapter that I removed or the whole section on talismans that was excised). For my occultist or cabalistic friends, many of the details will be old hat. Overall, chapters are kept to a fairly concise level without going off in all possible directions.

With these caveats in mind, <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/1876937">it is available</a>. I've made the PDF file of it freely available to anyone. There is a print version of it as well. The cost for that is the base lulu.com price. I'm not getting a single penny in return for any purchased copies. The print version is largely so that a few people, like my mother, can get decently bound copies of the thesis. For most othes, the PDF file will suffice.

I did purchase a copy of my own thesis (it is, indeed, a sad world) so I could make sure that the page flow, formatting, etc. was correct in book form. On the basis of that, I made a few changes (adding some blank pages in a couple of places and reformatting my table of contents)  and also created a much prettier cover.
