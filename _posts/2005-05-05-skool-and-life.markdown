My new term has started. It seems like it won't be quite as straightforward as the last one but we'll see. The World Religion class is vaguely interesting in that the prof will pretty much let you write about anything you want. The downside of this freedom is, of course, that you need to find something interesting to write about. You can't simply to an analyzation of the text or something, which I could do for my last History class until the final paper.

I still have not heard my final grade from my Philosophy professor. He was supposed to have turned in grades days ago but nothing is available. Since my grade is somewhat subjective, I don't think I want to go poke the bear by sending him an e-mail saying "Where the fuck is my grade?!" (Though it would be amusing)

I've been continuing to try to identify thesis topics. Looking at the work that others have done, my thesis is likely to be about 60 to 90 pages long (double spaced even). Not tiny but not a dissertation by any means. I'm considering doing it on some aspect of Enochian magic using Faivre and Hanegraaf's work as a framework. I picked up Faivre's <b>Theosophy, Imagination, Tradition: Studies in Western Esotericism</b> this week. While I've just passed the deadline for an indepdent study for this fall, the main prof of the program said I could still do one if I got the paperwork in soon. I am thinking of doing one focusing on Faivre and Hanegraaf as that would help provide a launching point for my thesis. 

I had e-mail communication with R. A. "Bob" Gilbert this week. A mutual friend put us in contact because Gilbert is highly placed in Masonic research along with being one of the few people with access to a number of document archives, particularily one of the Golden Dawn caches. He doesn't know of any defunct esoteric orders that preserved their documents so that track may be dead but he offered to help me get access to a bunch of the original Golden Dawn papers if I'm willing to travel to England. This is probably something quite worthwhile to consider for later research, if not my thesis.

I have remembered that I actually have an original mimeographed and hand-drawn Whare Ra Neophyte ritual script booklet. It's possible that I could use that as a primary text but Bogdan did his dissertation partially on the Golden Dawn Neophyte ritual so I'm not sure how useful that would be.

In unrelated new, I picked up a used copy of Jeff VanderMeer's <b>City of Saints and Madmen</b> and a little hardcover of Trungpa's <b>Meditation in Action</b>. Things to consider taking with me on the trip tomorrow.

In two and a half weeks, I'll be back in Madison, WI for the Dzogchen Retreat with Khachab Rinpoche. I'm looking forward to it but I know it won't be easy. He's going to expect people to knuckle down during the retreat. While rewarding, I expect that it will be difficult as well.
