This weekend is the second annual [East Bay Mini Maker Faire](http://ebmakerfaire.wordpress.com/) in Oakland, CA. As the EBMMF website says:

> A Maker Faire is about celebrating learning and doing – not the finished and perfect end product.  It’s a place to share what we’re learning with others, and celebrate the fun and freedom of being an amateur.

> Featuring both established and emerging local “makers,” the East Bay Mini Maker Faire is a family-friendly celebration coming to Oakland for its second year on Sunday, October 16, 2011.  It will feature rockets and robots, DIY science and technology, urban farming and sustainability, alternative energy, bicycles, unique hand-made crafts, music and local food, and educational workshops and installations.

[Ace Monster Toys](http://www.acemonstertoys.org) participated in the first of these last year just a few months after we were founded and in our workshop space. (You can see [last year's photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157625234566442/).) This year, we're returning. (Hopefully it won't be raining the entire time this year!) This is a great event for kids, hosted by the [Park Day School](http://parkdayschool.org) in the Temescal neighborhood of Oakland, CA. AMT will have a table, be showing off a few of our projects from our laser cutter, and probably spending much of the day doing small prints on the 3D printers. 

I encourage people to come to the event, have a good time, and stop by and talk to us. Bring your kids! We promise not to leave them alone with the soldering irons!
