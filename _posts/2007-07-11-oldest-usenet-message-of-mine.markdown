I've found the oldest archived Usenet message of mine (but not the oldest that I made, I know) on Google Groups.

It is a post on the BBS software that I used to do UUCP (unix to unix copy, a store and forward networking system) to connect to Usenet. This is from November, 1990. I'd been online for a year or two at that point but not on Usenet much.

Wow, almost 17 years...

Most of my early posts are not easy to find unless you knew me then. I had a set of three or four 'nyms (happy pirate nicknames) that I used on bulletin board systems and the Internet back then. It is only in 1996 or so that I started using my legal name commonly online (after college and well into my tech career).
