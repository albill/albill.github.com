I saw this during lunch today at <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/02/06/haggard.ap/index.html">CNN</a>.
<blockquote>
<h2> Haggard convinced he's 'completely heterosexual,' minister says</h2>
<strong>DENVER, Colorado</strong> (AP) -- One of four ministers who oversaw three weeks of intensive counseling for the Rev. Ted Haggard said the disgraced minister emerged convinced that he is "completely heterosexual."

Haggard also said his sexual contact with men was limited to the former male prostitute who came forward with sexual allegations, the Rev. Tim Ralph of Larkspur told The Denver Post for a story in Tuesday's edition.

"He is completely heterosexual," Ralph said. "That is something he discovered. It was the acting-out situations where things took place. It wasn't a constant thing."</blockquote>
I find this especially sad because in another world, this fellow would be able to be open and talk about what is really going on within himself and perhaps discuss the troubles he has had or what it is like to be evangelical and homosexual. The fact is that we're never going to get a straight story (no pun intended) from him.

I don't believe for a moment that he isn't gay but who knows, right? With our national climate in most places, he's not exactly in a position to be open about any of it. Given his history, I think he has quite a bit to answer to from the gay community but that's up to them to take up.
