A Buddhist and artist that I know from twitter, [the
Kamikazen](http://thekamikazen.com/), designed a new logo for my blog
today. You can see [his
post](http://thekamikazen.com/2010/09/15/steampunk-dharma/) on it (as
"Steampunk Dharma"). He's also making t-shirts of it [available as
well](http://www.redbubble.com/people/thekamikazen/t-shirts/5916251-1-steampunk-manjushri).
The full version can be seen below. It is a steampunk Manjushri, which
fits very well with the byline of the blog of "Open Source Buddhism,
Technology, and Geekery."

For those unfamiliar with Manjushri, I recommend the [wikipedia
article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manjushri) on him. He is often
considered the embodiment of praj침캐, which is the wisdom of the
praj침캐paramita texts, foundational to Mahayana Buddhism. You can read
about [steampunk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk) as well but it
is, essentially, a literary, fashion, artistic, and gaming movement that
re-imagines the pre-World War I industrial age as it should have been or
in a fantastical way reflecting our current values and viewpoint from a
post-Industrial age. (It has also been called, "What happens when goths
discover brown.") There is a lot of fiction being written that is
steampunk and a lot of makers (like the people at my hackerspace) make
steampunkesque gadgets with brass, gearing, and lots of welding. My
monthly gaming group is playing a 19th century steampunk game as well as
the crew of an airship. So, all in all, I think it is a pretty
appropriate logo to have on my blog. I'm really thankful for the
Kamikazen for having done it for me. It is a great piece of artwork.
