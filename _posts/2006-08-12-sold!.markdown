Our house, after three extensions due to paperwork screwups with the buyer, their agent, and the lendor, finally officially sold just before 5:00 PM on Wedesday. I received the net proceeds via wire transfer on Thursday (I refused to believe the sale until I received the money). We are finally free of the house in Seattle. It took ten weeks to sell from the time we listed it. On another note, I opened an e-trade account yesterday with money from my own savings and bought a bunch of shares of Apple. I believe more in Apple than my old employer at this point...
