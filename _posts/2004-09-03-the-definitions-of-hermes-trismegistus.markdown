<p>This is drawn from a late period document that survives, as I recall, only in 
Armenian translation via Christian monks. It is obviously drawn from the same 
overall tradition as the Corpus Hermetica and other hermetic materials from late 
antiquity. Someone on a list I&#39;m on took the time to type it up. I&#39;ve gone 
through and reformatted it a bit and corrected some typographical errors.</p>
<h2>The Definitions of Hermes Trismegistus to Asclepius</h2>
<h3 align="center">1</h3>
<p>1. God: an intelligible world; world: a sensible God; man: a destructible 
world; God; an immovable world; heaven: a moveable world; man: a reasonable 
world. Then there are three worlds. Now the immovable world is God, and the 
reasonable world is man: for both of these units are one: God and man after the 
species.</p>
<p>2.Consequesntly there are three worlds on the whole: two units make up the 
sensible and one is the intelligible; one is after the species, and the third is 
after its fullness. All of the multiple belongs to the three worlds; two of them 
visible: the sensible and man, that destructible world; and the intelligible is 
this God: he is not visible, but evident within the visible.</p>
<p>3. Just as soul keeps up the figure (while being) in the body, which cannot 
possibly be constituted without a soul, likewise all of that visible cannot 
possibly be constituted without the invisible.</p>
<p>4. Now man is a small world because of soul and breath, and a perfect world 
whose magnitude does not exceed the sensible god, the world. The world is 
intelligible and God is Nous; he is the truly uncreated, the intelligible; by 
essence, the uncreated and the ineffable, the intelligible good. In a word, God 
is the intelligible, invisible and ineffable good.</p>
<p>5. God is eternal and uncreated; man is mortal (although) he is ever-living.</p>
<h3 align="center">2</h3>
<p>1. Nous is the invisible good; soul (is) a necessary movement adjusted to 
every (kind of ) body. A body is (made out) of the four qualities, (as) a 
well-tempered composition of warm, cold, dry earth, of wet (i.e.) of water. 
Breath is the body of soul or the column of soul.</p>
<p>2. Heaven is an eternal body, an immutable body, unalterable and mixed out of 
soul and Nous. Air is the separation of heaven from the earth or the conjunction 
of heaven and earth, by which they are united (with each other) by the air.</p>
<p>3. Earth is the support of the world, the basis of the elements, the nurse of 
the living (beings), the receptacle of the dead; for (it comes) last after fire 
and water, since it became what (it is) after fire and water. What is the power 
of the world? To keep for ever the immortal (beings), such as they came into 
being, and to always change the mortal.</p>
<p>4. Water is a fecund essence, the support of the earth, as a nutritive 
essence.</p>
<p>5. Fire is a sterile essence, the duration of the immortal bodies and the 
destruction of the mortal: an infertile substance, inasmuch (it belongs to) the 
destructive fire which makes (things) disappear and the perpetuation of the 
immortal (beings), since what cannot be consumed by fire is immortal and 
indestructible, but the mortal can be destroyed by fire.</p>
<p>6. Light is a good, a clear vision, (which makes) appear all of the visible 
(things). The essence of fire is burning. However, fire is one (thing) and light 
is another one. For what fire has reached shall be destroyed, but light appears 
just as it is by itself. Every move of soul is perceived by Nous; since it is 
some (kind of) energy, breath performs (it).</p>

<h3 align="center">3</h3>
<p>1. Nothing is uninhabited by God, for where heaven is, God (is) too, and 
where the world is, heaven (is) too. I think that God is in heaven, and heaven 
in the world.</p>
<p>2. Many (places) are uninhabited by humans; for where the world is, the 
earthy (is) too, but man is not on every earth. The sea is large, as well as the 
earth, but heaven by itself (is as much as) both the sea and earth. [And he 
wanted to say that, by its magnitude, heaven is (as much as) both the earth and 
the sea, so large as the two of them may be, since by taking everything into 
(itself), it encompasses it and it contains it enclosed within (itself).]</p>
<p>3. Heaven is larger than everything, and the sun than the earth and sea, for 
it extends beyond both of them. However the earth is larger than the sea, 
because the sea (comes) from it. And in heaven are all (the beings), for it 
contains the superior ones and it (also) contains the inferior, enclosing them 
from every side.</p>
<p>4. God is the good (which is) previous to all the intelligible (beings); God 
is the father of the intelligible; heaven is the maker of the body. The 
magnitude of the light of the sun is earth and sea; the magnitude of heaven (is) 
the world; the magnitude of the world is God.</p>
<h3 align="center">4</h3>
<p>1. The living (beings) in heaven are constituted of fire and air, and those 
(which are) on earth of the four elements. man (is) a reasonable living (being), 
for he has Nous; but all of the other living (beings) which are endowed with 
voice have breath and soul, since all that decreases and increases is a living 
(being).</p>
<p>2. And among the living (beings), some are immortal and animated some have 
Nous, soul and spirit, some (have) only spirit, some (have) soul and spirit, and 
others only life. For life can acquire consistency without spirit, Nous, soul 
and immortality, but all of the others without life cannot possibly exist.</p>
<h3 align="center">5</h3>
<p>1. (Reasonable) speech is the servant of Nous. For what Nous wants, speech in 
turn interprets. Nous sees everything, and eyes all corporeal (things). And yet 
Nous does not become an observer for the eyes, but the eyes for Nous.</p>
<p>2. To Nous nothing in incomprehensible, to speech nothing ineffable: when you 
keep silent, you understand; when you talk, you (just) talk. Since Nous 
conceives speech in silence, only (that) speech (which comes) from silence and 
Nous (is) salvation. (But that) speech (which comes) from speech (is) only 
perdition; for by (his) body man is mortal, but by speech (he is) immortal.</p>
<p>3. Who does not understand speech has no Nous, who talks without Nous says 
nothing: since he understands nothing, he has no Nous and he talks, for his talk 
is a crowd and a crowd has neither Nous nor (reasonable) speech. Speech endowed 
with Nous is a gift of God; speech without Nous is a finding of man. Nobody sees 
heaven and what (is) therein, but only man. Only man has Nous and speech.</p>
<h3 align="center">6</h3>
<p>1. Just as the gods are God&#39;s possessions, (so is) man too; and man&#39;s 
possession is the world: if there were nobody to see (it), what would be seen 
would not even exist. Only man understands the intelligible (things) and sees 
the visible, for they are no aliens to him. Man has at once the two natures, the 
mortal and the immortal (one). Man has the three essences, (namely) the 
intelligible, the animated and the material (one).</p>
<p>2. Just as you went out of the womb, likewise you will go out of this body; 
just as you will no longer enter the womb, likewise you will no longer enter 
this material body. Just as, while being in the womb, you did not know the 
(things which are) in the world, likewise when you are outside the body, you 
will not know the beings (that are) outside the body. Just as when you have gone 
out of the womb, you do not remember the (things which are) in the womb, 
likewise, when you have gone out of the body, you will be still more excellent.</p>
<p>3. The present (things) follow close upon the past, and the future (close) 
upon the present. Just as the body, once it has gained perfection in the womb, 
goes out, likewise the soul, once it has gained perfection, goes out of the 
body. For just as a body, if it goes out of the womb (while it is still) 
imperfect can neither be fed nor grow up, likewise if soul goes out of the body 
without having gained perfection it is imperfect and lacks a body; but the 
perfection of soul is the knowledge of the beings. Just as you will behave 
towards your soul when (it is) in this body, likewise it will behave towards you 
when it has gone out of the body. --Contain thyself, O Trismegistus</p>
<h3 align="center">7</h3>
<p>1. But now, what is man? What (else) is neither body nor soul? --Aye, dear 
Asclepius, who (ever) is not soul, is neither Nous nor body. For (one) thing is 
what becomes the body of man, and (another) thing what comes in addition to man. 
Then, what should be called truly a man, O Asclepius, and what is man? The 
immortal species of every man.</p>
<p>2. And (the species) of every living being (is only in one part of the 
world,) but the sole species of man (is) at once in heaven, on earth, in the 
water and in the air. Just as the body is marvelously molded in the womb, 
likewise the soul in the body.</p>
<p>3. From the murk into light the body goes out of the womb, but soul enters 
the body from the light into darkness. The sight of the body is the eye; but 
that of soul is Nous. Just as a body which has (got) no eyes sees nothing, 
likewise a soul which has (got) no Nous is blind. Whatever the (babe) in the 
womb will crave for, so will the pregnant woman desire the same; likewise 
whatever (Nous) in soul will crave for, so will man desire the same.</p>
<p>4. Soul enters the body by necessity, Nous (enters) soul by judgment. While 
being outside the body, soul (has) neither quality nor quantity; (once it is) in 
the body it receives, as an accident, quality and quantity as well as good and 
evil: for matter brings about such (things).</p>
<p>5. God is within himself, the world is in God, and man in the world. His 
(i.e. man&#39;s) deficiency is ignorance, his plenitude is the knowledge of God. 
(...Evil consists in ignorance and good in knowledge.)</p>
<h3 align="center">8</h3>
<p>1. All (beings) cannot possibly exceed their own capacity. Nature is everyone 
of the beings of this (world); there is a law which is in heaven above destiny, 
and there is a destiny which has come into being according to a just necessity; 
there is a law which has come into being according to the necessity of humans, 
there is a god who has come into being according to human opinion.</p>
<p>2. Divine bodies do not have access paths for sensations, for they have 
sensations within themselves, and (what is more) they are themselves their own 
sensations. What God does, man does not do it; and whatever God does, he does it 
for man; but what man does, he does it for soul.</p>
<p>3. Those who worship idols (worship plain) pictures. For if they worshipped 
with knowledge, they would not have gone astray, but since they do not know how 
they worship, they have gone astray, (far) from piety. Man has the faculty of 
killing, God of giving life.</p>
<p>4. The body increases and reaches perfection, due to nature; and soul fills 
up with Nous. Every man has a body and a soul, but not every soul has Nous. 
Consequently there are two (types of) Nous: the one (is) divine and the other 
(belongs to) soul. Nevertheless there are certain men who do not have even that 
of soul. Who(ever) understands the body, also understands soul; who(ever) 
understands soul, also (understands) Nous, because the admirable is (a) natural 
(object) of contemplation: each of the two is seem by means of the other.</p>
<p>5. Nature is the mirror of truth; the latter is at once the body of the 
incorporeal (things) and the light of the invisible. The generous mature of this 
(world) teaches all (the beings). If it seems to you that nothing is a vain 
work, you will find the work and the crafts man, if it seems to you (like) a 
mockery, you will be mocked at.<br>
<br>
6. You have the power of getting free since you have been given everything. 
Nobody envies you. Everything came into being for you, so that by means of 
either on (being) or of the whole, you may understand the craftsman. For you 
have the power of not understanding with your (own) will; you have the power of 
lacking faith and being misled, so that you understand the contrary of the 
(real) beings. Man has as much power as the gods. Only man (is) a free living 
(being), only he has the power of good and evil.</p>
<p>7. You do not have the power of becoming immortal; neither does, indeed, the 
immortal (have the power) of dying. You can even become a god if you want, for 
it is possible. Therefore want and understand and believe and love: then you 
have become (it).</p>
<h3 align="center">9</h3>
<p>1. Every man has a notion of god: for if he is a man, he also knows God. 
Every man, by the very (fact) that he has got a notion of God, is a man, for it 
is not given to every man to have (such a) notion. Man and the gods and all 
things (exist) by God and because of man. God is everything and there is nothing 
outside God, even that which does not exist: since as to God, there is no such 
thing, even one single that he is not himself. Man (comes) from another man, the 
gods (exist) because of God. Man (exists) because of God; everything because of 
man. God rules over man; man over the whole.</p>
<p>2. The exterior (things) are understood by the external (organs): the eye 
sees the exterior (things), and Nous the interior. The exterior (things) would 
not exist, if there were not the interior (ones). Where(ever) Nous (is), there 
is light; for Nous is light and light (is) Nous. Who(ever) has Nous is 
enlightened, and who(ever) has not Nous is deprived of light.</p>
<p>3. Who(ever) knows God, does not fear God; who(ever) does not know God fears 
God. Who(ever) knows none of the beings fears everyone; who(ever) knows all of 
them fears none.</p>
<p>4. Soul&#39;s illness: sadness and joy; soul&#39;s passions: desire and opinion. 
Bodies are similar to souls when they are seen: none is ugly (if it is) good, 
none is evil (if it is) honest. Everything is visible to one who has Nous; 
who(ever) thinks of himself in Nous knows himself and who(ever) knows himself 
knows everything. Everything is within man.</p>
<p>5. Who(ever) behaves well towards his body, behaves badly towards himself. 
Just as the body, without a soul, is a corpse, likewise soul, without Nous, is 
inert. Once a soul has entered the body, it (soul) will acquire Nous. That which 
does not acquire (it), goes out such as it entered. For every soul becomes 
endowed with Nou. That (soul) which has gone out of the human body has (got) an 
ill memory: for soul, (even) covered with the body, is forced to remember its 
(soul&#39;s) unforgetfulness. One change is unforgetful and another change brings 
about forgetfulness.</p>
<p>6. Wher(ever) man is, also (is) God. God does not appear to anybody but man. 
Because of man God changes and turns into the form of man. God is man-loving and 
man is God-loving. There is an affinity between God and man. God listens only to 
man, and man to God. God is worthy of worship, man is worthy of admiration. God 
does not appear without man; man is desirable to god and God to man, because 
desire comes from nowhere, but from man and God.</p>
<p>7. Human work the land, (and) stars adorn heaven. the gods have heaven; 
humans, heaven, earth and sea; but the air is common to gods and humans.</p>
<h3 align="center">10</h3>
<p>1. What is good? What bears no comparison. God is invisible, (but) evil is 
conspicuous. What is a female? A receptive fluidity. What is a male? A seminal 
fluidity.</p>
<p>2. Nature in man is omniform, and (it is) an energy endowed with all 
qualities (whose) force (is) invisible and effects (are) conspicuous. An energy 
is a movement. matter is a wet essence; a body is an agglomeration of matter.</p>
<p>3. Nous (is) in soul, and nature (is) in the body. Nous (is) the maker of 
soul, and soul, (the maker) of the body. Nous (is) not in all soul, but nature 
(is) in all body.</p>
<p>4. The immortal nature (is) the movement of the mortal nature, (as to) 
mortality, earth is its grave; (and) heaven (is) the place of the immortal. the 
immortal came into being because of the mortal, but the mortal comes into being 
by means of the immortal. Evil is the deficiency of good, good (is) fullness of 
itself.</p>
<p>5. Soul is bound to be born in this world, but Nous is superior to the world. 
Just as Nous is unbegotten, so is matter too, (although) it can be divided. Nous 
is unbegotten, and matter (is) divisible; soul is threefold, and matter has 
three parts; generation (is) in soul and matter, (but) Nous is in God for the 
generation of the immortal (beings).</p>
<p>6. Providence and Necessity (are), in the mortal, birth and death, and in 
god, unbegotten (essence). the immortal (beings) agree with one another and the 
mortal envy one another with jealousy, because evil envy arises due to knowing 
death in advance. the immortal does what he always does, but the mortal does 
what he has never done. Death, if understood, is immortality; if not understood 
(it is) death. they assume that the mortal (beings) of this (world) have fallen 
under (the dominion) of the immortal, but (in reality) the immortal are servants 
of the mortal of this (world).</p>
<p>7. therefore soul is an immortal essence, eternal, intellective, having, as 
an intellectual (thought), its reason endowed with Nous. By understanding 
nature, it attracts to itself the intellect of (the planetary) harmony; then, 
once it is freed from this natural body it remains alone with itself (and) is 
grieved, belonging only to itself in the intelligible world. It rules on its 
reason.</p>
