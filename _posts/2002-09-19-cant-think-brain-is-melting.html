<strong>Christ, what a day.</strong>

I got to work an hour or so early today (about 8:00 am) to drive an "offsite" for the overall test team that I am a lead on. What that means is that I was the facilitator ("MC" according to the test managers) for a four hour meeting at the Microsoft Conference Center for a group of about 110 testers that form our overall test team (the immediate team I work with is about 30 people in that...). I booked the center, got our food ordered, put together an agenda, roped other leads into presenting topics from the agenda, reviews the powerpoint slides they made and then held everyone's hand as we did the whole damn thing. My coworkers were cool about the whole thing but it has involved multiple weeks of planning and praying that nothing goes long.

Once that was done, my boss took me and my peer test leads to lunch for an hour at Tony Roma's to recover. <strong>Then</strong> we went back for a two hour leads meeting with the head of our organization (my boss' boss) where I fought to stay awake.

Six hours of meetings. Hardly a record for me but it is when it was only two meetings...
