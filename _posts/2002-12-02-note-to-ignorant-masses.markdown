**To:** Ignorant Crack-smoking Occultists Just because I run
[Hermetic.com](http://www.hermetic.com) does not mean that my grey
matter is a liquid puddle on the floor or that I am intrinsicly
interested in your crackpot occult theories. Unsolicited spam mail about
the secrets of Enoch and the end of mankind will be treated like all
other crank mail and trashed. Al **P.S.** Also note, even though I host
pages by or containing content by Hakim Bey, Sam Webster, Ben Rowe,
Sabazius, Bill Heidrick and others, I am not these people. I may or may
not know them well (or at all) and addressing mail to me meant for them
or spamming me with your need to know their e-mail addresses now will
also be roundfiled at \\dev\\null. Thank you. **P.S.S.** I'm not
Aleister Crowley either. I am a sarcastic bastard, if it is close enough
to count. (You get like this the ten thousandth time someone sends you
mail addressed to "Mr. Bey" or "Dear Bill.")
