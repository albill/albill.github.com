<strong>To:</strong> Ignorant Crack-smoking Occultists

Just because I run <a href="http://www.hermetic.com">Hermetic.com</a> does not mean that my grey matter is a liquid puddle on the floor or that I am intrinsicly interested in your crackpot occult theories. Unsolicited spam mail about the secrets of Enoch and the end of mankind will be treated like all other crank mail and trashed.

Al

<strong>P.S.</strong> Also note, even though I host pages by or containing content  by Hakim Bey, Sam Webster, Ben Rowe, Sabazius, Bill Heidrick and others, I am not these people. I may or may not know them well (or at all) and addressing mail to me meant for them or spamming me with your need to know their e-mail addresses now will also be roundfiled at \dev\null. Thank you.

<strong>P.S.S.</strong> I'm not Aleister Crowley either. I am a sarcastic bastard, if it is close enough to count.

(You get like this the ten thousandth time someone sends you mail addressed to "Mr. Bey" or "Dear Bill.")
