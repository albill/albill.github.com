<a href="http://www.thorncoyle.com/">Thorn</a> and I met yesterday for her interview for the <a href="http://www.extemplo.org">Ex Templo</a> podcast at her place in San Francisco. We spoke for about an hour or so for the recorded podcast and I think it went pretty well. I'm editing the audio files and I will try to get the first portion online before the end of the week. I'm going to <a href="http://2007.wordcamp.org/">Wordcamp</a> all next weekend so I actually do have an imperative to get this done before then. One of the things I'll be doing there is attending the <a href="http://2007.wordcamp.org/schedule/podcasting/">Podcasting</a> session with the maker of <a href="http://www.mightyseek.com/podpress/">Podpress</a>, which I use for podcasting. I'm looking forward to this little two day conference.
