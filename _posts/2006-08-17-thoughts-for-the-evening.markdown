Pain...back...thumb...feet... We're back from Aikido for the evening. I
feel completely thrashed. The scary thing is that, in the grand scheme
of things, it wasn't that harsh of a workout (or workover). I did a lot
more rolling and falling than previous weeks. I think I'm doing pretty
well at it but a few of them were roughly done and my body is letting me
know it. It's a relatively low key group and people are pretty helpful.
I'm learning to identify which of the people are more and less helpful.
I try to work with anyone that I can but some definitely seem to be more
into it than others since I'm still the FNG\* and tripping over myself
half the time. Sometimes I feel sorry for the blackbelts who spend their
time working mostly with newbies moreso than each other but I suppose
that it is by teaching us that they learn important things as well. In
other areas, I'm still waiting to hear back about my thesis work. My
hoped for mentor will not be allowed to supervise my thesis as his
degree is in the wrong discipline (or he's classed as such). They are
looking for a replacement but the gears of the university turn slowly.
I'm finally getting around to reading Ian McDonald's [**River of
Gods**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591024366/), which is just
shameful considering that I bought the British edition since it came out
and I've sat on it since then. It's even worse since he's one of my
favorite authors. My copy of the new Tim Powers novel, [**Three Days to
Never**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0380976536/), arrived as well.
That should be good and being between terms gives me a week or two to
read.
