In the appalling/weird/Japanese department, this was <a href="http://crave.cnet.co.uk/mobiles/0,39029453,49302361,00.htm">found on CNET UK</a> today:
<blockquote>"You read correctly. The Odin 99 has landed on the streets of Japan, and a single tap of the phone's dedicated lotus-leaf button will load a private, customisable, animated altar.

The idea is to allow Buddhists to perform their dedications and rituals conveniently when away from home. You can simulate incense burning, purification rites and play music to help you meditate wherever you happen to be. "</blockquote>
