We signed paperwork this morning at the title company. As of December 6, we will be moving into our new house in Oakland that I've posted about previously. We are now Bay Area home owners (for better or worse). Our house guest asked us last night why we would ever move out of the loft. The only reason is to own our own place as the loft is really cool. I'm going to miss it.
