The hotel has had its generator replaced and power is now restored. As
you can see, [Jono](http://jonoscript.wordpress.com/) was able to do his
presentation on the role of furry creatures in the Mozilla Labs
development of [Ubiquity](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity).

P.S. I did hear that when we lost all of our power, the room safes
locked themselves. Unfortunately, many Mozilla people had placed their
passports within them...
