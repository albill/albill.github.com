The hotel has had its generator replaced and power is now restored. As you can see, <a href="http://jonoscript.wordpress.com/">Jono</a> was able to do his presentation on the role of furry creatures in the Mozilla Labs development of <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity">Ubiquity</a>.

P.S. I did hear that when we lost all of our power, the room safes locked themselves. Unfortunately, many Mozilla people had placed their passports within them...
