It&apos;s good and bad to go back to work after a long weekend away from things. I shouldn&apos;t complain too much since I&apos;m only working three days this week and one day next week along with my travels. Sunday night was spent attending a gathering of local OTO people to celebrate the initiation of a few other people. We had a nice time and it was good to go out on a Sunday night without worrying about work the next day. Other than that, it was largely a weekend spent at home. Madeline came over on Monday and we watched "Lilo and Stitch," which wasn&apos;t half bad for a Disney movie. I wanted to watch "Spy Kids 2" but she had seen it last night. I also rented Tsui Hark&apos;s "The Vampire Hunters" which R and I watched this evening. Crazed vampires in 18th century China being hunted by wandering martial artists with a bit of magic thrown in. Fun stuff. Monday evening was largely devoted to "Crack" which is what we call "Law & Order" in this house. They were having a Law & Order marathon all day Monday and I made the mistake of turning it on while I was eating dinner. Three or so hours later, I was able to pull myself away. There is a hidden curse in that show!
