R and I watched <strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266452/">Death to Smoochy</a></strong> this evening. It's been about a year and a half since I saw this movie and I'd forgotten how much I love it. When we first saw it, we didn't know what to expect and had moderate expectations. This movie lives up to them and beyond. It has little people, smack addicts, sexually ambiguous children's TV stars, Irish mobsters, and a man in a pink, plush rhino costume singing songs about how your stepdad isn't mean, he's just adjusting...

A lot of fun and I recommend it to any of my friends who haven't seen it yet. The rest of you can go hang.
