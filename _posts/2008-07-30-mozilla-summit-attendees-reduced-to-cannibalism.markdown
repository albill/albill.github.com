Here at the [Mozilla Summit](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Summit2008) this
week, we may soon we reduced to cannibalism. (Perhaps this is an
existing Canadian tradition, I'm not sure...) Apparently, last night a
[rock
slide](http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/07/30/bc-highway-rockslide-whistler.html)
dropped on the road between Whistler and Vancouver, B.C. This is the
[road used by
everyone](http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=4d2f2262-e433-42e4-b27f-a3228f38df3f)
coming into and out of the town for visits and it hugs a cliff face next
to a river for most of its length. Since some of the rocks are the size
of trucks and, I hear, the pile is 10 meters high in places, they aren't
sure when the road will be cleared. It is said that dynamite will be
involved. Almost all of us are scheduled to fly out of Vancouver on
Friday, which may make it interesting since the low-end estimate is two
days for road clearance. There is another route around in the other
direction but it turns the two and a half hour trip into eight hour one.
Additionally, it turns out that the busses to take us back are all
sitting in Vancouver right now so they'd need to get here and then go
back.

Luckily, Whistler seems well stocked with food, beer, and bears, so we
should avoid lifeboat team building events.

**Update:** The B.C. government has announced that the road will be
closed for five days or so. Apparently, we will all be making the long
trek around in order to get to Vancouver. This means that for my 3:45 PM
flight, I'm probably leaving Whistler around 4:00 AM (assuming four
hours earlier than my previous time). Wheee!! **Update 2:** I wasn't far
wrong. I'm taking a 3:00 AM bus for eight hours to get to Vancouver from
here the long way around. (I then get to wait almost five hours at the
airport for my flight...) Others are leaving at 6:00 PM tomorrow,
Midnight, and then 2:00 AM and the late morning... [A bug has been
opened](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=448604) as well, in
true open source fashion. More commentary is available through blogs on
