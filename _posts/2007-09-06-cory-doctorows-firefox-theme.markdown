I'm a big fan of [Cory Doctorow](http://www.craphound.com), the science
fiction author, DRM activist, [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net)
editor, and former [EFF](http://www.eff.org) evangelist. Cory has a book
coming out next spring, **Little Brother**, which is about a gang of
hacker kids unjustly targeted by the Department of Homeland Security. In
this book, Cory details a number of ways that the kids fight back with
their mad skillz using real technology, as he has related it, but quite
a few of the things that he has them do are real. He has mentioned on a
couple of occasions that he has worked out a deal with
[Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/) to do a series of
projects related to the things the kids do in the book to show how they
could be done. Yesterday, I listened to a podcast Cory has up of a
[discussion with Patrick Nielsen](http://craphound.com/?p=1888) about
the book from the [Tor Books
podcast](http://www.tor-forge.com/podcasts). As a brief aside, Cory
mentions that as part of the promotion of the book, a "Little Brother"
theme is going to be made available for Firefox. He then mentions
including [Tor](http://tor.eff.org), that I've blogged about before, in
it. (This means it isn't just a theme but, hey...). He's also talk about
doing key signing for crypto keys at his book signings to help create a
web of trust amongst book readers. I find it interesting that he would
center on using Firefox to promote his book and then use these as a
means to promote Tor and crypto in general. This is all the more
interesting when you realize that this is a "YA" or "Young Adult" book,
targeted towards kids, even if adults read it. Good times! The book will
be available online for free under a Creative Commons license, like all
of Cory's books. I've included the podcast below. The **Little Brother**
conversation starts at the fifteen minute mark if you wish to listen to
it.
