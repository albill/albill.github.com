A happy Beltane to all. Today is the first of May and it is a
traditional holiday for much of Europe traditionally.

R and I went over to the home of the Sargents, good friends of ours.
Denny cooked Thai soup and we all hung out for a while waiting for our
friend, Robert, to arrive.

As it got dark, we all went out to a clearing in their large, forested
yard. There, we all performed an invocation to Pan to bring in the May.

We then went inside their yurt (which is used for ritual work) for a
little more ritual and relaxing.

After closing the ritual space, R and I came home. Compared to some
Beltane rites we have attended, it was rather sedate and small but these
are good friends and it was nice to worship with them.
