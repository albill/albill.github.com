Well, stage one of my move is complete. I'm sitting in a 90% empty apartment with my cats right now. People started assembling at 9:30 but we didn't really get going until 10:15 or so. I had a few no shows but brought his wife and things worked. It took us about an hour to pack the truck and an hour to unpack it. After giving everyone a tour of the new house, I took them to Red Robin for chow.

I'll be leaving soon. No net access at the new place. I'll probably check my e-mail tomorrow here at the apartment and then take my cats and computers over. I don't have to be out until the end of the month so I have plenty of time to clean. I want to get the shrine and such set up at home soon as well.
