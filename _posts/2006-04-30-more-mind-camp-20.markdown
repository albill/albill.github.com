I've attended a number of sessions now (ok, six) and we're all getting a bit tired here. Probably a third of the people are staying the night. Some of the ones who left will come back in the morning but not all... There are a number of interesting morning sessions.

I've take a number of pictures but they won't go up until later. There is a flickr tag for the photos from here so you can see the uploads of a few others at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/mindcamp20/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/mindcamp20/</a>.
