![image](http://www.arcanology.com/images/bsterling-web.jpg)So, Bruce
Sterling came to Microsoft campus yesterday. He's doing a book promotion
tour for his new book, ***Tomorrow Now***, which I read an advance copy
of over Thanksgiving. (It's a good book.) He decided not to go with any
sort of prepared presentation but do just "do a riff" on current events,
especially business and computers. He was pretty thought provoking and
very entertaining. I have a streaming video of the meeting that I can't
save so I may pull a quote or two from it if I have a chance. He's got
some good zingers. He was a web log online at
[http://www.infinitematrix.net/columns/sterling/](http://www.infinitematrix.net/columns/sterling/)
which has a clip of him ranting. Coolness. I encourage people to go to
[Viridian Design](http://www.viridiandesign.org) and join his e-mail
list for the Viridian group if you are into his stuff. He has a
manifesto up as well at

if you haven't heard of the Viridian group before.
