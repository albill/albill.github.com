<img hspace="10" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/bsterling-web.jpg" />So, Bruce Sterling came to Microsoft campus yesterday. He's doing a book promotion tour for his new book, <strong><em>Tomorrow Now</em></strong>, which I read an advance copy of over Thanksgiving. (It's a good book.)

He decided not to go with any sort of prepared presentation but do just "do a riff" on current events, especially business and computers. He was pretty thought provoking and very entertaining. I have a streaming video of the meeting that I can't save so I may pull a quote or two from it if I have a chance. He's got some good zingers.

He was a web log online at <a href="http://www.infinitematrix.net/columns/sterling/">http://www.infinitematrix.net/columns/sterling/</a> which has a clip of him ranting. Coolness.

I encourage people to go to <a href="http://www.viridiandesign.org">Viridian Design</a> and join his e-mail list for the Viridian group if you are into his stuff. He has a manifesto up as well at <a href="http://www.chriswaltrip.com/sterling/viridian.html">http://www.chriswaltrip.com/sterling/viridian.html</a> if you haven't heard of the Viridian group before.
