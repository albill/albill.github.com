I'm going to attend a version of the Rites of Eleusis that happens in
California every year. It turns out R has gone to this before and has
spoken quite highly of it. I'll be gone for a bit over a week at it. I'm
rather looking forward to this... They have a [web
site](http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Aegean/3193/) which speaks a bit
about the original rites and some about the event.
