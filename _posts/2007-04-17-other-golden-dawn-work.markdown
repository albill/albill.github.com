One of my readers, Guido Woudenberg, alerted me that there is a thesis
on the Cipher Manuscript of the Golden Dawn and another on the history
of the order. I don't know the name of the author (title pages were
missing) but Guido sent me copies of the texts. I read over them this
evening. The one on the Cipher Manuscript was pretty interesting and
well written. The one on history was fine but didn't really touch on
anything in a new way. I'm happy to say that I didn't find anything in
either that contradicted what I've already written and the author uses
largely the same sources (and even the same references in them) that I
use. There are a few to Poke's book on the Cipher Manuscript that
indicate that I should dust off my copy and double-check it. I haven't
quoted from it because Poke is a magician, not a scholar, Master's
degree notwithstanding. Right now, I'm trying to find a way to get
copies of material from the [Crowley
collection](http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/research/fa/crowley.aleister.html)
at the Ransom Center at the University of Texas, Austin. Amongst all of
the Crowley material, there are hundreds of pages of J. F. C. Fuller's
and Allan Bennett's copies of Golden Dawn material:

> **Subseries A. Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, 1901-1907** Box 15
>
> 1.  1 Bennet, Allen, nd, bound notebook with holograph notes,
>     diagrams, and translations, 72pp
> 2.  "Ceremony of the Equinox" and "Ritual of the 0ยบ=0ยบ Neophyte," nd,
>     30pp Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Vol. 1-6, 1906-7,
>     holograph copy from the manuscripts of Allen Bennet by J.F.C.
>     Fuller, 767pp (\*removed to boxes 17 and 18) History of the
>     Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn
> 3.  Essay about the Order, nd, typescript copy, 15pp
> 4.  Letters and papers re the Golden Dawn dispute, 1901
> 5.  Unknown author, nd, materials re Enochian Tables
> 6.  Westcott, W. Wynn, nd, bound notebook with holograph versions of
>     CLAVICULA TABULARUM Enochi (or BOOK H), "The Chaldean Oracles of
>     Zoroaster," "Analogy: A Lecture on Mystic Learning," and "The
>     General Guidance and Purification of the Soul," 140pp

Access to copies of much of this would solve many issues that I have
with a lack of primary source materials. Unfortunately, you can only get
copies of items at the discretion of the staff and only 350 pages per
six months. I need a breakdown of the details so I can ask for specific
sets of pages. Most specifically, I'd like to get copies of the Neophyte
ritual, knowledge lectures, the Z papers, and Mather's lecture on the
Tree of Life as Projected in a Solid Sphere. Short of going to Austin
myself (unlikely) there is no way to get a detailed list that I know of.
Even with one, being there in person doesn't get copies made any more
quickly and they apparently take months to fulfill orders.
