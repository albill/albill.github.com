From the end of [this article](http://www.wie.org/j25/monks.asp) on the
Marathon Monks of Tendai, **27,000 Miles to Buddhahood**.

> But when asked about the practice, Sakai's spirit shines: “Human life
> is like a candle,” he says. “If it burns out half-way it does no one
> any good. I want the flame of my practice to consume my candle
> completely, letting that light illuminate thousands of places. My
> practice is to live wholeheartedly, with gratitude and without regret.
> Practice really has no beginning or end; when practice and daily life
> are one, that is true Buddhism.”
