My Buddhist teacher, Rev. Jiun Foster, just put another podcast up on
his [**Path of the Ekayana**](http://daiun-ji.org/path/) podcast that I
think some of my readers may enjoy, especially those who are part of the
loosely connection movement of American Buddhists. Most of the podcast
is a conversation between Jiun Sensei and my peer, Steve Hozan Coaston,
who is a fellow senior student at [Daiun-Ji Great Cloud
Temple](http://www.daiun-ji.org/). The topic of the conversation is the
possibilities and direction of Buddhism in America with all of the
traditions that comes together here in the States as Buddhism develops
over time here. I especially like Jiun Sensei's ideas about councils of
Buddhist traditions where people come together from different temples
and lineages of practice while still maintaining their identity and
lineage as separate Buddhist traditions. In the end, we are all
followers of the Dharma. Listen to it at the [blog
entry](http://daiun-ji.org/path/?p=55) for the podcast or below in the
enclosed a link to the audio. I encourage those that find it interesting
to [subscribe](http://feeds.feedburner.com/daiun-ji/thzP) to the **Path
of the Ekayana** podcast ([available via
