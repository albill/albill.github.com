Veleda has posted the ritual schedule for the Temple of All Gods (TAG) at Burning Man next week.

Looks like some interesting stuff. I won't be there until Wednesday but except to go full bore after that. Looks like a lack of sleep on some days though. Maybe someone will have room under their shade structure for my tent.
