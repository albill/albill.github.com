Veleda has posted the ritual schedule for the Temple of All Gods (TAG)
at Burning Man next week. Looks like some interesting stuff. I won't be
there until Wednesday but except to go full bore after that. Looks like
a lack of sleep on some days though. Maybe someone will have room under
their shade structure for my tent.
