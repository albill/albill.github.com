I saw a [notice last
night](http://infusion.vox.com/library/post/google-tech-talk-inside-vmware-fusion.html)
about a talk that [Ben Gertzfield](http://infusion.vox.com/) gave at
Google the other day as a [tech
talk](http://www.youtube.com/user/googletechtalks). Ben works for
[VMware](http://www.vmware.com) and did a lot of work on VMware Fusion.
Fusion is the Mac-based virtualization product that VMware released the
1.0 version of a few months ago. I've written about virtualization a bit
during the last few months because we use virtual machines quite a bit
for our testing at MoCo. The advantages are the ability to run multiple
operating systems, as needed, on the same machine and also the ability
to save state or start from a known good state. This gives QA the
flexibility to quickly test on multiple operating systems. [VMware
Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/) is the software that we
generally use for this because most of us in QA have Mac machines for
our primary boxes. The others running Linux or Windows can use VMware
Workstation and still share virtual machines with us because VMware uses
a common format (for the most part...) between products. The one
unsolved issue, something that is causing pain now that Leopard is
coming out, is that there is still no way to create virtual machines for
Mac OS X. This makes the testing of Mac products a little rougher (and
is part of why many of us choose to have a Mac as our primary work
machines). Ben speaks in his talk a bit about the capabilities of Fusion
and a lot about the internals of how it functions on the Mac. He also
demonstrates things a bit and speaks a little about the future. There is
also a bit of Q&A at the end. I found it to be pretty interesting, even
if it fairly long. The talk is up on
[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJPq_8ULpRg) for viewing for
those interested in watching it.
