From Naropa Admissions after I e-mailed them since I noticed no mention on their website now of the program that I was looking at doing with them...No MA for me there.
<blockquote>Thank you for your e-mail. Unfortunately, Naropa University has decided not to offer the low-residency Buddhist Studies program, which had been planned for summer 2005. We apologize for any inconvenience this might cause. We offer several residential Religious Studies programs and other low-residency programs that you may be interested in. You can read about those programs online at <a href="http://www.naropa.edu/graduate.html">http://www.naropa.edu/graduate.html</a>.</blockquote>
