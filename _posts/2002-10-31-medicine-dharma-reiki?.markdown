Does anyone know anything about "Medicine Dharma Reiki" aka "Men Chhos Rei Kei"? See <a href="http://www.medicinedharmareiki.com">http://www.medicinedharmareiki.com</a> or <a href="http://www.healing-touch.co.uk/pa-mcrk.htm">Introduction to Men Chhos Reiki</a>. The "tm" on everything kind of turns me off but these are the people sponsoring the White Manjushri Empowerment and the Amitayus Empowerment in the next two weeks. They are associated with Acharya Lama Gursam.
