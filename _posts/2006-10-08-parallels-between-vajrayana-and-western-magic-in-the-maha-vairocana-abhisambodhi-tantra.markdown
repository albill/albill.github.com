I've been reading a translation of the Maha-Vaircocana Abhisambodhi
Tantra by Stephen Hodges. This is one of the root tantras used in China
(when Tantric Buddhism existed there) and Japan. The ritual work that I
do is ultimately derived from it along with some other sources. In my
experience within the Tibetan tradition, since translations of the
tantras are so uncommon, most people have never read them. In that
tradition as well, given a thousand years of commentary and elaboration,
many lamas seem not to bother either. They focus on the later material.
If any of my pagan or magician friends want to see the parallels between
the magical traditions of the West and those of Buddhism, look below.
This is part of the description on how the master practitioner lays out
or visualizes the mandala of the deities before doing the ritual work to
transform into the primary deity. It ought to seem rather familiar in
tone and in some of the structural elements.

## Chapter X: The Wheel of Letters

### Verse 19

> Having done the ritual to transform the colours, he should make the
> *mudra* or mantra of the Blessed Lady Prajna-paramita and recite this
> *Vidya* Queen eight times. Then arising from [that *samadhi*], he
> should circumambulate the Mandala and enter within. With the power of
> great kindness and compassion, he should focus his attention upon the
> trainee practitioners (*sadhaka*) and transform himself into the
> Action Vajra-sattva with *Va*, together with Varada-vajra, and then he
> should draw the Mandala which Arises from Great Compassion. For that,
> the specifications of the inner mandala are as follows: In the centre
> there is the Bhagavat Maha-Vairocana, seated upon a white loture, with
> topknot and crown, wearing a lower garment of cotton or silk and an
> upper garment of embroidered silk. He is encircled by an aura which
> shines like gold in colour. He should draw either his *mudra*, his
> body-image, or his syllable. Of this, his syllable is *A*. In the
> east, the letter *A* with an *anusvara*, the essence of the dharmakaya
> of all the Buddhas: *AM*. In the north-east, he should draw the Mother
> of all the Buddhas, the Blessed Lady Gagana-locana, or else her
> syllable *GA*. In the south-east, he should draw the symbol of all the
> Bodhisattvas, the Wish-fulfilling Gem, or its syllable *KA*. In the
> north, he should draw a lotus symbol or the syllable *SA* for the
> Bodhisattva Padmapani together with all the Bodhisattvas who are held
> back by one birth. In the south there are three sections. He should
> draw the vajra symbol or the syllable *VA* for the Lord of the Secret
> Ones together with his vajra entourage. In those three sections, he
> should draw the symbol of all the Vajradharas or the letter *HUM*.
> Below the Bhagavat Vairocana he should draw either the symbol or
> syllable of Acala who is seated upon a crag, holding a sword and a
> noose in his hands, and who is encircled with a blazing aura,
> threatening all obstructors. His syllable is *HAM*. In the north-west
> he should draw either the symbol or the syllable of the destroyer of
> great obstructors, Trailokya-vijaya. He has a flaming aura above,
> which is like the fire at the time of the Great Destruction. He causes
> absolute terror. In his hands he holds a vajra that radiates light.
> His syllable is *HA*. Then in the four directions, the four great
> Guardians should be arranged. In the east he should draw either the
> symbol or the syllable of the great guardian Abhaya, like gold in
> colour, wearing white garments, with a slightly fierce face and
> holding a staff in hand. His seed syllable is *CA*. In the north he
> should draw the symbol or syllable of Sarva-trasa-vinasa, coloured
> white, holding a sword in his hand, wearing white garments, with a
> blazing aura that destroys all fear. His syllable is *GA*. In thw west
> he should draw the symbol or syllable of Durdharsa, coloured like red
> asoka flower, wearing red garments, with a smiling face, looking at
> the mandala of the entire assembly. His syllable is *SAH*. In the
> south he should draw the symbol or syllable of Vajradanta-damaka, the
> great guardian, black in colour, with a face wrinkled in wrath,
> wearing a black lower garment, with a crown and topknot, who causes
> all world systems to be illumined with his lustre, holding a club in
> his hand and destroying the great obstructors. His syllable is *KSA*.
> They should be accompanied by their entourages and their servants, all
> seated upon white lotuses.

Following this and more mandala creation (which is layered on this), the
master of the ritual generates bodhicitta (loving kindness towards all
beings or the mind of enlightenment), makes the appropriate mudras and
transforms himself ritually in tothe action form of Vajrasattva.
