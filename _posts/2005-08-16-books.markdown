<p>R and I stopped by Third Place Books the other day and I picked up a few 
books there.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0812523989/">
	Wildside</a></b> by Steven Gould.</li>
	<li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/087728931X/">
	The Key of Solomon the King</a></b> (in Hardcover for cheap!)</li>
	<li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1559391545/">
	The Life of Shakbar: The Autobiography of a Tibetan Yogi</a></b>, translated 
	by Matthieu Ricard.</li>
	<li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0300044240/">

	size, 100 page hardcovers, one for each blue lodge degree)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m meeting my friend Sarastro for Birthday Beer at the Elysium Brewery 
tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Tonight is a quiet evening of comic books and finishing my trashy novel (<b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0451460189/">The 
Tale of the Thunderbolt</a></b>). R is out at an OTO officer&#39;s meeting so I&#39;m 
all alone.</p>
<p>This is my one week between terms. I&#39;m still waiting for my Literature grade 
to appear (with my final paper graded as well).</p>
