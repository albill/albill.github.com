R and I stopped by Third Place Books the other day and I picked up a few
books there.

-   **[Wildside](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0812523989/)**
    by Steven Gould.
-   **[The Key of Solomon the
    King](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/087728931X/)**
    (in Hardcover for cheap!)
-   **[The Life of Shakbar: The Autobiography of a Tibetan
    Yogi](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1559391545/)**,
    translated by Matthieu Ricard.
-   **[Secret Ritual and Manhood in Victorian
    America](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0300044240/)**
    by Mark Carnes.
-   Introduction to Freemasonry by Carl H. Claudy (this is three, small
    size, 100 page hardcovers, one for each blue lodge degree)

I'm meeting my friend Sarastro for Birthday Beer at the Elysium Brewery
tomorrow night.

Tonight is a quiet evening of comic books and finishing my trashy novel
(**[The Tale of the
Thunderbolt](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0451460189/)**).
R is out at an OTO officer's meeting so I'm all alone.

This is my one week between terms. I'm still waiting for my Literature
grade to appear (with my final paper graded as well).
