We received our keys to the loft today. We now have a permanent home in Oakland.

I've included a few photos that I took today below. I have a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157594184002636/">set up on Flickr</a> as well.

The place has two bedrooms, a bathroom and a washer and dryer downstairs. The upstairs is what you see in the photos. Two large rooms, one with a platform over it, with giant ceilings and lots of windows and skylights.
