I'm a hair's breadth from stopping my Latin. Latin 103 starts today and
will be followed by Latin 104. I need to do both if I'm going to have a
year's worth of Latin. Latin 104 finishes in December and I've been
taking classes since last September (since I didn a term of Ancient
Greek). I'm just getting a little tired of two 1 1/2 hour of evening
classes a week plus homework and memorization for a language. I'd just
like a week or two of coming home from work and doing my own thing on
stuff... On a plus note, I put Norton's Imperium up at
[http://www.hermetic.com/browe-archive](http://www.hermetic.com/browe-archive/).
This is Ben Rowe's old site. He's passed away and they finally took his
website down in the last few weeks so I put my promised archive up.
