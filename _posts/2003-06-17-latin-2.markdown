I&apos;m a hair&apos;s breadth from stopping my Latin. Latin 103 starts today and will be followed by Latin 104. I need to do both if I&apos;m going to have a year&apos;s worth of Latin. Latin 104 finishes in December and I&apos;ve been taking classes since last September (since I didn a term of Ancient Greek). 

I&apos;m just getting a little tired of two 1 1/2 hour of evening classes a week plus homework and memorization for a language. I&apos;d just like a week or two of coming home from work and doing my own thing on stuff...

On a plus note, I put Norton&apos;s Imperium up at <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/browe-archive/">http://www.hermetic.com/browe-archive</a>. This is Ben Rowe&apos;s old site. He&apos;s passed away and they finally took his website down in the last few weeks so I put my promised archive up.
