Brady posted about a time-lapse video which covers Black Rock City (the city created for Burning Man) over the course of its existence. This was taken from one of the solar power centers that had been built for the event.

You can see the footage at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEdZpoWTBBw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEdZpoWTBBw</a>.

I saw this and asked myself, "I wonder if this thing caught the arson that burned the Man early on Tuesday morning?" The answer is "yes." You can see a still image that I grabbed below but the fun starts when there are six minutes and 48 seconds left on the video. Afterwards, you can see the fire crews (in time-lapse) and a mess like a hornet's nest kicked over.

Fun times. It's too bad that I didn't go this year but Japan calls...
