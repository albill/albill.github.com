Of course it is on the last night that we are here that I find out that there is an open wifi connection in the spa area about 40 feet from our cabana. At night, when it is closed, their power outlets are open as well. Ah well, I shouldn't spend my vacation online but it is 10:00 PM here and everyone is either drinking or going to hang out in the dark in their cabanas. I'm joining R in a couple of minutes in ours... Tomorrow, we go to Coba and then to Merida.
