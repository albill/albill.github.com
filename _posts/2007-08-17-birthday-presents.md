My momma loves me. She sent me some books for my birthday (which is on this Sunday).

She sent me:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Contemplative-Science-Buddhism-Neuroscience-Converge/dp/0231138342/">Contemplative Science: Where Buddhism and Neuroscience Converge</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._Alan_Wallace">B. Alan Wallace</a>. I'm a big fan of Wallace's books and his current work on <strong><a href="http://www.sbinstitute.com/research_Shamatha.html">The Shamatha Project</a></strong> for the <a href="http://www.sbinstitute.com/">Santa Barbara Institute for Consciousness Studies</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/InterWorld-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0061238961/">Interworld</a> by Neil Gaiman and Michael Reaves. I doubt if Gaiman needs an introduction to most of my readers and this the new novel that he co-authored.</li>
</ul>
Thanks, Mom!
