I've had the memoria.com domain since 1996 (I think and I'm too lazy to
look). I'm thinking of retiring it, as much as I like it, as I get
massive amounts of spam to my domain and it wouldn't be terribly
disruptive since it only hosts my home page. I'm trying to think of a
good domain name, probably Latin and somewhat Classical like 'memoria'
is, to register for my new domain. If anyone has any suggestions that
aren't taken, I'd love to hear them.
