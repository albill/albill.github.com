Since I'm bored and posting this evening, I figure I'll post more
pictures of myself from Greece! I'd post pictures of R but she's shy so
I'll let her do that on her own. The first two are from my trip to
Greece with R this last April. I have lots of random pictures of Greece
but given their size, I thought I'd hold off on more. I've posted a
gallery link before as well.
