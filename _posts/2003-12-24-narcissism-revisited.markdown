Since I&apos;m bored and posting this evening, I figure I&apos;ll post more pictures of myself from Greece! I&apos;d post pictures of R but she&apos;s shy so I&apos;ll let her do that on her own. The first two are from my trip to Greece with R this last April. I have lots of random pictures of Greece but given their size, I thought I&apos;d hold off on more. I&apos;ve posted a gallery link before as well. <center>
