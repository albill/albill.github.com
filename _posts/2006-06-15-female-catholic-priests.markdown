If they had existed when I was a kid, I suspect that my mother would never have left Catholicism to become a Dianic Witch. A driving factor in this, she has told me very clearly, was the role of women in Roman Catholicism and her personal inability to become more involved with the Catholic Church. Eventually, she was a lay Carmelite nun but I don't think that was enough until finally she found Goddess worship and Dianic Witches.
