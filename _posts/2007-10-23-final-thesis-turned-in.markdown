![Ronove the Goetic
Spirit](http://www.arcanology.com/images/ronove.png)I know that very
many people are sitting on the edges of their seat in regards to my
thesis but it seemed worthwhile to share. Last Thursday, I received the
marked up copy of my thesis from my program. This is the thesis as
reviewed by the office of Graduate Studies. What the office of Graduate
Studies does is go through your entire thesis and examine it to see if
it conforms to formatting and editing guidelines. This is things like
the size of your margins, the format of your table of contents. In other
words, mind numbing stuff. They also happen to read it and occasionally
mark other things, like typos. My marked up thesis from that office
showed me that I had my indenting wrong on my Works Cited section and
the roman numerals were off a quarter inch on my introductory pages.
Other than that, the reader asked for a minor amendment to my abstract,
suggested commas in a few places (ok...) and found a couple of typos
that three professors missed. I worked on this Thursday evening late,
printed it out on the nice, 25% cotton rag, paper required for the final
copy of the thesis and mailed it back to the program on Friday. Assuming
that I didn't miss an error, I'm done. Period. The next time I hear from
my program should be to tell me that the thesis has been accepted for
graduation and to tell me that I've graduated. That should be before the
end of the year. I expect to receive my diploma one to six months later
depending on the motion of the stars and the return of great Cthulhu.
Now I should determine if I really do want to go get a PhD at some
point. I should also consider if I want to write a paper or two for any
of the upcoming conferences dealing with Western Esotericism or esoteric
thought. At this point, I think I'd like to work on a book on some
**other** topic but we shall see. For those interested in reading my
final thesis, please contact me either through comments or my e-mail
(for those that have it) and I'll probably be happy to pass a copy of it
on to you. If I don't know you at all, it might be good to give me some
sort of introduction as I generally keep copies of the thesis within the
groups of people who either work in this area or have a personal
interest in esotericism in the West.
