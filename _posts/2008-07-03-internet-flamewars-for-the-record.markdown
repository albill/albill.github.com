For the record, I tend to agree that Internet Flamewars are just kind of
sad and not worth the time. I say this as someone who has infamously
engaged in them at various points as well. (I think my wife pretty much
tunes them out too at this point). Like everyone else though, I tend to
get caught up in them. It's so easy to get all agitated sitting in front
of your computer at the distant voices and just start typing shit in
response. It is probably good to remind ourselves that the people on the
other end are just like us, normally. Which means, they may be obnoxious
and passionate bastards at times but are probably with their good points
as well. I need to remember this as much as anyone. I'm reminded of XKCD
at this point:
