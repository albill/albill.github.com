For the record, I tend to agree that Internet Flamewars are just kind of sad and not worth the time. I say this as someone who has infamously engaged in them at various points as well. (I think my wife pretty much tunes them out too at this point). Like everyone else though, I tend to get caught up in them. It's so easy to get all agitated sitting in front of your computer at the distant voices and just start typing shit in response. It is probably good to remind ourselves that the people on the other end are just like us, normally. Which means, they may be obnoxious and passionate bastards at times but are probably with their good points as well. I need to remember this as much as anyone. I'm reminded of XKCD at this point: <p align="center">
