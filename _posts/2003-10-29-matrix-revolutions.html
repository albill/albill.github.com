I&apos;ve been looking closely at the released trailers for the Matrix Revolutions and I just noticed a "real world" shot with a ship (obviously piloted by Neo and Trinity) is crashing into the ground. The interesting thing is that the shot is at an up angle and you can see a large break in the eternal cloud cover ("burned sky") behind them and the moon showing through. I wonder if that is a plot point?
