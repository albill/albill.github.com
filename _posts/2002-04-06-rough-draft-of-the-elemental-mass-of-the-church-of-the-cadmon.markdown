Lesa and I wrote this a number of years ago. It was a work in progress for a long, long time and, to this day, I still feel that it is missing some key elements along with quite a bit of polish. It is pretty defunct as a project now though.

The Church of the Cadmon, as such, sponsored a Hermetic study group here in Seattle that met twice a month.  and I ran this twice a month for about seven or eight months. That study group evolved into a working group and that working group became the current lodge that I still work with. We have the original core of people from the study group even with the loss of Redegg and a few others. Since that time, our focus, as a group, has moved far away from the Church of the Cadmon.

<p align="center"><strong>The Elemental Mass
of the Cadmonite Church</strong>

<em>Celebrants </em>

The celebrants of the rite differ depending on the form of the Mass. The Low Mass (LM) may be performed by a Priest acting alone, or with the assistance of one Acolyte. The High Mass (HM) is performed by a Priest acting with the assistance of one member of each of the minor orders -- one Acolyte, one Exorcist, one Lector and one Deacon or someone acting to fulfill the role of one of these orders.

The ritual clothing of the officers is based on their order within the Church. All celebrants except the priest will wear a simple pair of loose pants and a long (hip-length) loose shirt made of white cotton. (A pattern for these items will be provided.) This is the standard uniform for ritual activities for all members of any of the minor orders outside of the mass as well. Over this clothing, a tabard is worn during ritual work. The colors for the tabbard by celebrant are as follows:
<ul>
	<li>Acolyte - A red with green trim</li>
	<li>Lector - A blue with orange trim</li>
	<li>Deacon - A green with brown trim</li>
	<li>Exorcist - A violet with yellow trim</li>
</ul>
The Priest wears the following over his white clothing: A black, loose tunic with a white sash.

<em>Purpose of Rite </em>

To awaken the souls of those present to the presence of the Unity as the Cadmon, which they inherently bear within themselves. Also, to ritually reenact the cosmogenesis and the division and re-membering of our selves and the universe.

<em>Method </em>

Ritual and symbols are used in this rite to enact the creation of the cosmos, its division into the myriad parts of the phenomenal world, and its reunification in the Cadmon through the symbology of the elements.

<em>Ritual Space </em>

The ritual space is circular with a central altar of square design. At the four cardinal points at the edge of the space are square altars for the four elements, decorated with altar cloths of the appropriate symbolic colors and possibly images. The elements: the <strong>Rose</strong> for Air, the <strong>Candle</strong> for Fire, the <strong>Wine</strong> for Water, and the <strong>Platter</strong> for Earth begin the rite on their altars andÂ  remain there unless otherwise moved throughout the ritual. The central altar is covered with a white cloth with black trim. In the middle of the central altar is the <strong>Lamp of the Spirit</strong> and in LM, at the north and south edges, the <strong>Water Cup</strong> and the <strong>Fire Censer</strong>. (In HM these are brought in by two of the celebrants.) Situated around the altar, at the cross-quarter points, are four large candlesticks with white candles.

It should be noted that the four elements are placed at the actual cardinal pointsassigned to them, irrespective of the layout of the space in which the rite is held.

<strong><em>The Mass</em><em> </em></strong>

<strong>1. Entrance of the Celebrants.</strong>

LM: The Priest enters the space from the East, proceeding directly to the altar. The Acolyte enters behind him, and circles sunwise one and a half times to West, then advances to the altar. Reaching the altar, the Acolyte turns to face West, and proclaims <strong>"Hekas Hekas Esti Bebeloi!" </strong>

HM: The Priest enters the space from the East, proceeding directly to the altar. The other celebrants file in behind him, in the following order: Acolyte with Fire Censer, Exorcist with Sword, Lector with Book, and Deacon with Water Cup. As they enter the space, all four complete one and one-half circles around the periphery of the space going with the sun, completed in the West, and then begin to drop out at their elemental stations as they continue circling with the sun. As each takes his station, the officer stands to the left of their elemental altar. When all officers are at their stations, they turn outward, and proclaim <strong>"Hekas Hekas Esti Bebeloi!"</strong> in unison.

The Priest lights the four candles around the central altar.

<strong>2. Consecration of the Space.</strong>

LM:

Priest: <strong>"Let this place be purified with water and consecrated with fire."</strong>

The Acolyte then purifies and consecrates the space with Water Cup and Fire Censer. He takes the Water Cup from the west side of the altar and goes to the East of the space, making a small semi-circular loop around the altar to do so. In the East, he moves sunwise around the periphery of the space, stopping at each of the elemental altars. After he does this with the Water Cup, he returns to the altar from the East, and then circumambulates as before with the Fire Censer. During each circumambulation, with each implement he turns outward and inscribes an equal-armed cross in the air over each elemental altar.

Additionally, as he goes to each of the altars, with the Water Cup, he then sprinkles water thrice with his hand to form the points of a downward pointing triangle at each altar. With the Fire Censer, he swings it thrice to form the points of an upward pointing triangle at each altar. When he returns East after circumambulating the space, he says, with the Water Cup, <strong>"I purify with water"</strong> and holds the cup high. When he returns with the Fire Censer, he says, <strong>"I consecrate with fire"</strong> and holds the censer high. He then returns to the central altar and deposits the Fire Censer. After this, he loops sunwise around the altar in a semi-circle to the west side and proceeds to stand on the right of the water altar.

Priest: <strong>"Let the powers of the elements be invoked."</strong>

The Acolyte then goes to the four quarters in turn, beginning with the East, and traces an invoking pentagram of the appropriate element to summon the spirits of the quarter.

Acolyte (pointing to the center of the pentagram): <strong>"The Names of the Unity sound forth throughout the <em>{{direction}}</em> quarter of the universe! By the Names and their power, I invoke you, angels and spirits of the element of <em>{{element}}</em>." </strong>

HM:

Priest: <strong>"Let this place be purified with water and consecrated with
fire."</strong>

The same actions are then done by the Acolyte in the Low Mass, by the Deacon with the Water Cup, and the Acolyte with the Fire Censer. Each one returns to his station when these actions are completed, still carrying cup and censer.

Priest: <strong>"Let the powers of the elements be invoked."</strong>

The Exorcist then goes to the four quarters in turn, beginning with the East, and traces an invoking pentagram of the appropriate element to summon the spirits of the quarter.

Exorcist (holding the sword point up): <strong>"The Names of the Unity sound forth throughout the <em>{{direction}}</em> quarter of the universe! By the Names and their power, I invoke you, angels and spirits of the element of <em>{{element}}</em>." </strong>

<strong>3. Preliminary Invocation.</strong>

LM &amp; HM:

Priest: <strong>"I invoke you, divine forces of the spirit of life."</strong>

Priest: <strong>"EXARP! BITOM! HCOMA! NANTA!"</strong>

Priest: <strong>"I invoke you, Angels of the celestial spheres, whose dwelling is in the invisible. You are the guardians of the gates of the Universe, be also the guardians of this holy place. Keep far removed the evil and the unbalanced. Strengthen and inspire us so that we may preserve unsullied this abode of the mysteries of the eternal Powers. Let this sphere be pure and holy so that, entering therein, we may become partakers of the secrets of the Light Divine."</strong>

Priest: <strong>"IAO!"</strong>

<strong>4. Entrance of the Elements.</strong>

LM: The Acolyte goes with Sun to each quarter in turn, takes up the element, bears it to the West and then to the altar. He then reverses and returns to his station in the West.

HM: The Elements are brought in to the altar by the four officers, all circling together to the West, advancing to the altar, returning to the West and then going back to their stations, moving sunwise all the while.

<strong>5. Creation of the Universe.</strong>

The lights are dimmed to be non-existent.

The Priest recites the following invocation, with matches or lighter in hand.

Priest: <strong>"Before all things are the silence and the darkness.</strong>

<strong>And the gates of the Land of Night.</strong>
<strong>And there was but a vastness of stillness and of depth</strong>
<strong>In the place of the gathering darkness.</strong>
<strong>Terrible was the silence of that uncreated world;</strong>

<strong>Immeasurable the depth of that abyss.</strong>
<strong>And in the darkness of vacancy, the Spirit moved,</strong>
<strong>And the Lightbearers existed for a space.</strong>
<strong>I have said darkness of darkness;</strong>

<strong>Are not the countenances of darkness fallen with kings?</strong>
<strong>Do the children of the Night of Time last forever?</strong>
<strong>And have they not yet passed away?</strong>
<strong>For Chaos cried aloud for the unity of form,</strong>

<strong>And the face of the Cadmon arose.</strong>
<strong>Before the glory of that countenance the night rolled back, and the
darkness hastened away before the light of the dawning creation." </strong>

The Priest lights the Lamp of the Spirit as the last line is spoken.

<strong>6. Sundering of Unity.</strong>

Priest: <strong>"And the Cadmon existed in Unity as One, its spirit and form reflecting the light of the One that was and is before all things known and unknown.</strong>

<strong>In that space where only Chaos and Old Night had existed, the Cadmon now dwelt in silence, its light stretching to fill the void left by Darkness. </strong>

<strong>The Cadmon encompassed the Void but there were no others there to reflect the brilliant light of the One. </strong>

<strong>In its unity, the Cadmon was alone, leaving creation incomplete.</strong>

<strong>And as life brings forth life, the Cadmon divided itself to create the Many from the One. In so doing, the promise of Creation was fulfilled.</strong>

Priest lights the candles one by one as he says<strong>:
"And Spirit took on heat and dryness, and became Fire."</strong> (Priest Lights an altar candle)

Response (made by everyone present):<strong> "Blessed be the Fire." </strong>
P: <strong>"And Spirit took on cold and fluidity, and became Water."</strong>
(Priest Lights an altar candle)

R: <strong>"Blessed be the Water."</strong>
P: <strong>"And Spirit took on heat and fluidity, and became Air."</strong>
(Priest Lights an altar candle)

R: <strong>"Blessed be the Air." </strong>
P: <strong>"And Spirit took on cold and dryness, and became Earth."</strong>
(Priest Lights an altar candle)
R: <strong>"Blessed be the Earth."</strong>

P: <strong>"Four manifestations of one Unity, the elements of the body of the Cadmon."</strong>

The lights are turned up a bit so the room is now dim with candle-light.  It must be bright enough for people to move about in the space.

The priest steps back from the altar slightly to give room to other celebrants.

<strong>And Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, the elements of the body of the Cadmon, followed the Light to fill the Void. There was no place untouched, and all reflected the beauty and passion of the One.</strong>

<strong>At the center, the balancing point, the Spirit of the Cadmon remained.</strong>

<strong>Creation, in its entirety, was of the Cadmon, and the Cadmon was of all.</strong>

<strong>As above, so below."</strong>

Everyone: <strong>As above, so below.</strong>

LM &amp; HM: As the Priest says "And Earth, Air, Fire and Water...", the following actions occur:

LM: The Acolyte, beginning with the Wine, takes each element in turn <em>directly</em> from the central altar to its station always moving either directly between a station and the central altar or sunwise. He continues with the Platter, the Rose, and the Candle of Fire and then returns to the central altar.

HM: The Elemental Officers proceed directly from their stations at the elemental altars to the central altar and arrive at the side of the central altar facing their station. They take up the elements and turn sunwise to face outward.  The celebrants carry the Elements to the four quarters and their altars. They do so by circumambulating sunwise once, in unison and symmetry, with each officer finishing at the appropriate elemental altar after one full circle of the space as the celebrants move gradually outward making a spiral. They put the elements onto their altars and take up position to the left of each altar.

LM &amp; HM: After the Elements are positioned at the periphery of the space, the Priest speaks.

Priest: <strong>"Our world, in itself perfect and in want of nothing, was the product of Creation.</strong>

<strong>Filled with the beauty of the One become Many, all of Creation glittered in the light of the dawn.</strong>

<strong>The realm in which we dwell is one which was sacred from the beginning; in all things the Divine Light can be experienced.</strong>

<strong>The cycle of water from sea to land, to sea;</strong>

<strong>the marriage of fire and air;
the turning of the seasons;
the cycle of life and death;
the adaptation of life to circumstance.</strong>

<strong>And as part of creation, humankind also reflects the excellence of the Cadmon, and of the Unknowable One.</strong>

<strong>In our existence, we are a continual celebration of the process of Creation."</strong>

<strong>7. Lection.</strong><em> </em>

Priest: <strong>"The lection for our present service will be &lt;</strong><em>fill in with whatever it is</em><strong>&gt;."</strong>

In LM, the Acolyte then reads an appropriate passage from the Enneads, Corpus Hermeticum, or other suitably inspiring literature. In HM, the Lector will do the reading.

<strong>8. Special Intentions</strong><em> </em>

Special rites following the liturgical calendar, weddings, rites of remembrance, consecrations, and other activities will occur here.

<strong>9. Reunification.</strong><em> </em>

Priest: <strong>"We, in our world, are often so blinded by the darkness that we forget our divine heritage. Let each one of us remember who we are in the Cadmon, and seek to align ourselves in a quest for peace, knowledge, and unity with the vastness of the One. Through our actions we can be participants in the perfection of Creation; ourselves, our world, our cosmos. Seek then, to purify yourselves and unify your natures to that purpose.</strong> <strong>Please repeat with me the principles on which we are founded."</strong>

All: <strong>"That there is a One; the original, transcendent Unity at the heart of all things, which existed before time, which is the wellspring of Creation, and within which all things dwell.</strong>

<strong>That there is a Body of the Cadmon, the divine reflection of the One. Neither male nor female yet containing both, the Cadmon in its perfection divided itself to fill the Void.</strong>

<strong>That all of Creation is part of the Cadmon, and therefore reflects the supernal Unity which is beyond understanding.</strong>

<strong>That all life is sacred and worthy of respect.</strong>

<strong>That the Tree of Life is a map showing a path of reunification with the One.</strong>

<strong>That knowledge of the One and Creation can be attained through individual effort. We walk the path of reunification to gain this gnosis for the good of ourselves and others.</strong>

<strong>That inasmuch as the life of the Cadmon can exist in our world, the Mass of the Elements as a reminder of our roles in the magnificence of Creation.</strong>

Priest:<strong> "Let the elements of the world be joined together in balance through your endeavoring for unity, in the presence of Spirit. Let the Cadmon appear as the model for our striving, as in all we are, and in all we can experience, the Cadmon is reflected. Find not only new expressions of the radiance of the One, but remember also the ways it has been experienced in the past. Turn your hearts toward the vision of supreme excellence and freedom that is the One."</strong>

<em><strong>The Acolyte (LM) or the Elemental Officers (HM)</strong></em> return with the elements, again circumambulating with the sun once and ending up at the appropriate side of the altar. They each deposit their element on the altar, turn 180 degrees, and proceed directly to their station and stand beside it again (HM).

<strong>10. Dedications.</strong><em> </em>

LM &amp; HM: The Priest and all others present repeat, in turn, the following dedications.

Priest: <strong>"Let the blessing of the Unity go forth throughout the manifested universe."</strong>
Response: <strong>"Be it so."</strong>

P: <strong>"Let the blessing go forth to all who seek wisdom, and lead them to the source of light."</strong>
R: <strong>"Be it so."</strong>

P: <strong>"Let the blessing go forth to all who strive for the good, and grant them the strength to attain it."</strong>
R: <strong>"Be it so."</strong>

P: <strong>"Let the blessing go forth to all who suffer, and give them healing and peace."</strong>
R: <strong>"Be it so."</strong>

P: <strong>"Let the blessing go forth to all who are in need, and bring them fullness of life."</strong>
R: <strong>"Be it so."</strong>

P: <strong>"Let the blessing go forth to all who are gathered here today, members of the body of the Cadmon and of the Church. Let it fill us with light and life, and guide us in the ways of wisdom. Let courage, temperance, prudence, and justice illuminate and protect us and may the recollection of Unity be always with us as we go about the journeys of our lives."
</strong>R: <strong>"Be it so."</strong>

(At this point additional dedications, which are given to the Priest before the service, may be read. There will also be additional dedications assigned to the various special activities that may be included in the Mass. All respond to them with the words <strong>"Be it so"</strong>)

P: <strong>"Let the blessing go forth to all."</strong>
R: <strong>"Be it so." </strong>

<strong>11. Elemental Communion.</strong><em> </em>

Priest: <strong>"All that is left is for us to join in the communion of the elements, the body of the Cadmon." </strong>

The Priest then goes to West of altar and begins the Communion.

Priest: <strong>"Therefore, I invite all beings present, therefore, to breathe with me the perfume of this Rose, as a symbol of Air."</strong>

He smells the Rose.

Priest:<strong> "To feel with me the warmth of this sacred Fire."</strong>

He passes his hand over the flame.

Priest: <strong>"To eat with me this Bread and Salt as types of Earth."</strong>

He takes a piece of bread from the platter, dips it in the salt, and eats it<strong>.</strong>

Priest: <strong>"And finally to drink with me this Wine, emblematic of Water."</strong>

He drinks a cup of wine.

When he is finished, the Priest goes sunwise to the East side of the altar, gives communion to the next person, and then steps back to the East to allow this person to administer communion to the person following. The Priest stays in the East until all are finished.

LM: After the Priest takes communion, the Acolyte goes to the West, and prompts the congregation (if any) to line up for the Communion and advance one by one.

HM: The Lector, the Deacon and the Exorcist (in that order) circle around to West sunwise and take communion, one after the other. The Acolyte follows behind Exorcist, but instead of taking communion, he stays in West and prompts the congregation (if any) to line up for the communion and proceed.

LM &amp; HM:

The Acolyte takes communion last, finishes the wine, and proclaims <strong>"It is finished."</strong> The Priest returns to the center from the East.

<strong>12. Release of Energies.</strong><em> </em>

LM: Priest: <strong>"Let the powers of the elements be released."</strong>

The Acolyte then goes to each quarter in turn and traces a banishing pentagram of the appropriate element.

Acolyte (pointing to the center of the pentagram): <strong>"The Names of the Unity sound forth throughout the <em>{{direction}}</em> quarter of the universe! By the Names and their power, angels and spirits of the element of <em>{{element}}</em>, return in peace to your abodes."</strong>

Priest: <strong>"Let this place be purified with water and consecrated with fire."</strong>

The Acolyte purifies and consecrates the space exactly as in the beginning.

HM: Priest: <strong>"Let the powers of the elements be released."</strong>

The Exorcist then goes to each quarter in turn with drawn sword and traces a banishing pentagram of the appropriate element.

Exorcist (following each pentagram): <strong>"The Names of the Unity sound forth throughout the <em>{{direction}}</em> quarter of the universe! By the Names and their power, angels and spirits of the element of <em>{{element}}</em>, return in peace to your abodes."</strong>

Priest<strong> </strong>(as Exorcist resumes place)<strong>: "Let this place be purified with water and consecrated with fire."</strong>

The Deacon and Acolyte then purify and consecrate the space with the water and fire exactly as in the earlier consecration of the space.

<strong>13. The Benediction.</strong><em> </em>

Priest: <strong>"The Body of the Cadmon reflects the beauty of the One, let its image go with you now. Seek new understanding of Self, and our world, for breathing the essence of Unity fills us, and renews our hearts."</strong>

All: <strong>"Nature is the glass reflecting the One, as by the Moon reflected is the Sun."</strong>

Priest: <strong>"May the spirit and power of the ever-present Light encourage you to walk a steadfast path, uplift your mind and heart, and bring joy to you in the relentless march of days." </strong>

All: <strong>"I am of the One, the eternal Unity, beautiful and holy."</strong>

Priest: <strong>"May you feel blessed by the presence of the Divine Unknowable in all things, and may you continue to grow like a blossom in the Sun. Go now, in the truth of your secret heart."</strong>

<strong>14. Exit.</strong><em> </em>

The priest extinguishes the four candles around the altar. The celebrants return directly to the central altar. The priest takes up the Lamp of Spirit and all of the celebrants process out, following the Priest, in the order of their entrance with the Acolyte on the very end. They circumambulate sunwise once and exit the circle in the East and from there they go into the next room/space.
