R found out that the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythbusters">Mythbusters</a>" main stars, Jamie and Adam, were going to be at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratorium">Exploratorium</a> in San Francisco today to speak, run some science demos for kids, and sign their new book. We'd been wanting to go out to the Exploratorium at some point anyway so we took a trip into the city for this. <div style="text-align: center">
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  <img border="1" src="http://static.flickr.com/66/174176457_48bd729d33.jpg" />

They were doing the crowd thing but it was fun to see them. R and I then spent another hour and a half or so wandering the Exploratorium, playing with the gizmos there. It is similar to the Science Center in Seattle but about double the size.
