If you've ever encountered a video on Youtube or Google Video that you need to have, the Video Downloader site at 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <a href="http://javimoya.com/blog/youtube_en.php">http://javimoya.com/blog/youtube_en.php</a> will allow you to download it. For Youtube videos, you will generally need an FLV player. This allows you to play the flash-based video format that they use. One is available at <a href="http://www.martijndevisser.com/blog/article/flv-player-updated">http://www.martijndevisser.com/blog/article/flv-player-updated</a> but it is only for Windows. Luckily, most of the videos on Google Video are AVI format files playable in normal players. I've seen Quicktime on OS X have some issues with sound in them but <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.videolan.org%2Fvlc%2F&ei=_38uRdrJH4H6hAOn4ejVCg&sig=__1zrNvno8Y1RFGrWdb7aCZM2RDBk=&sig2=pMt9H5jHQfDZscbNw37cAw">VLC</a> works well with them on most operating systems. I've used this site to download a <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=983112177262602885&q=%22Alan+Wallace%22&hl=en">talk</a> that Alan Wallace did at Google a few months ago.
