This was posted on a private e-mail list that I am on today:
<blockquote>"Thought you all might be interested in a digital (i.e. PDF) version of a facsimile of the English translation of Agrippa's Three Books... It can befound at Michigan State University Library, digital collection: <a href="http://digital.lib.msu.edu/collections/index.cfm?TitleID=247">http://digital.lib.msu.edu/collections/index.cfm?TitleID=247</a>.

It is complete, very readable, and can be downloaded to your hard disk as a PDF file. It's 333 Megs.</blockquote>
