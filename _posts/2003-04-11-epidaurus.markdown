We drove out from Nafplio to Epidaurus, about 25 km away. It is a fairly
large site and the longtime home to the Asclepius cult. There are extant
writings on stele of the mythic origins of the cult preserved there
along with a lot of statuary. We wandered around the site for a while
along with the huge ampitheatre that is preserved there. We also looked
through the small museum on site. Both of us are getting a bit tired of
being in strange cities surrounded by non-English and some rather odd
customs. The trip is winding down. Tomorrow, we go into Athens for the
last few days before flying home Tuesday (local) morning. We should be
back in Seattle by the evening of the same day with the time shifts. In
Athens, we'll be staying with a friend of R's for at least a day. I'm
hoping to wash some clothes!!
