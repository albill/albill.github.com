Have you ever wondered what a Zen retreat is like, especially here in
the West? A documentary, "Bodhidharma's Shoe", was filmed at [Bodhi
Manda Zen Center](http://www.bmzc.org) in New Mexico. This is available
for online viewing in two parts on [Revver.com](http://www.revver.com).
I've watched both of the two parts and, while not quick paced (for
fairly obvious reasons), it is pretty interesting and relatively well
done. I'd recommend it to people interested in Zen and what a retreat
would be like.

I'm glad to see these sort of media materials being put online and not
simply the normal fare of Youtube. I know a lot of this sort of thing is
pretty unfamiliar to people and being able to see things, as opposed to
just reading about it, is helpful for a lot of people.
