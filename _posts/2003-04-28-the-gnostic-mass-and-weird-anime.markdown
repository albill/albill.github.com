Today was a much lower key day compared to yesterday. I stayed up until
about 3:00 am last night so I didn't get up until around 10:00 or so
this morning. R and I hung out for a while and I made us breakfast.
Afterwards, R cut my hair (and did a nice job as always). This
afternoon, we went to the monthly Gnostic Mass at the local OTO body and
got to see a mostly new mass team. I believe that the Priestess hadn't
done it before in public but I do know that the Deacon and both of the
Children were doing their first mass. It went well and I'm glad that I
got out to it today. R stayed behind to attend a workshop that the OTO
hosting on Domestic Violence along with a dinner. I headed over to the
comic book store and picked up some missing issues of **[The Red
Star](http://www.archangel-studios.com/comics/redstar/frame.htm)**, one
of the comics that I occasionally read along with the latest issue of
**Global Frequency**. I can't seem to get my missing back issues of that
one. After that, I picked up one of those little portable writing desks
that sit in your lap. Sounds pretty mundane but I've been getting pretty
tired of balancing my latin homework and textbooks in my lap without any
support. Someday I'll get a real desk that doesn't have a computer
already sitting on it for such things. At home after all of this, I
finally decided to watch that **[Reign: The
Conqueror](http://www.tokyopop.com/dbpage.php?propertycode=ALX&categorycode=VAN&page=introduction)**
show that R has been watching and enjoying. Wow, that show is a
**TRIP!** It looks a lot like **Aeon Flux** (which makes sense given the
people involved) but is essentially a retelling of the story of
Alexander the Great, at least in inspiration. This is definitely a
keeper for this Hermetic magician into the classics. ;-) Here is a brief
blurb from Amazon:

> This bizarre reworking of the story of Alexander the Great features
> character designs by Peter Chung (Aeon Flux). It's a singularly weird
> mixture of anime conventions, sci-fi and fantasy elements, special
> effects, and muddled ancient history. Alexander's comrades and future
> generals, including Hephaestion and Ptolemy, have been recast as
> effete courtiers. Bucephalus ("Ox-head"), his steed, is a flesh-eating
> monster. His mother is a Medea-esque sorceress, and his tutor
> Aristotle has the inevitably spunky niece, Cassandra. The
> magician-disciples of Pythagoras appear and disappear, searching for
> the "Platohedron." The elongated, mannerist figures bear Chung's
> distinctive stamp. The women wear revealing robes; the men run around
> in bits of armor and codpieces. Reign is slated for the Adult Swim
> bloc on the Cartoon Network, but editing this violent series to
> American broadcast standards will pose real challenges. (Unrated;
> suitable for ages 17 and older: violence, nudity, alcohol use,
> grotesque imagery, sexual situations) --*Charles Solomon*

I actually saw the DVD of this at the comic book store. Now I'm thinking
that I should pick it up to keep...
