R and I went to see the [Bay Area Derby
Girls](http://bayareaderbygirls.com/) tonight. This is a local Roller
Derby organization. The San Francisco Shevil Dead were playing against
the Oakland Outlaws. R has a coworker who is on the Oakland Outlaws
team, which was how we found out about the event. Wikipedia has an
article on [Roller Derby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_derby) and
it actually features a photo of the Oakland Outlaws right on the main
page. The Bay Area is part of a revival of Roller Derby that is
currently occurring. Seattle is another hotspot of activity. For myself,
I had vague memory of women on roller skates knocking each other down
from childhood TV but that was about it. It's back and we had a good
time knee deep in cheap beer and kitsch. I took a number of pictures but
it is hard to get a sense of the action from them. You can [look on
Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157594306894925/) if
you'd like. Otherwise, you can take a look at the video I shot with my
camera. I shot it in 640 x 480 at 30 frames per second but Youtube
samples it down a bit so it isn't quite a nice there. See the video at
[Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pR6Qu9-VIrI).
