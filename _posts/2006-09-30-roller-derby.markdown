R and I went to see the <a href="http://bayareaderbygirls.com/">Bay Area Derby Girls</a> tonight. This is a local Roller Derby organization. The San Francisco Shevil Dead were playing against the Oakland Outlaws. R has a coworker who is on the Oakland Outlaws team, which was how we found out about the event. Wikipedia has an article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_derby">Roller Derby</a> and it actually features a photo of the Oakland Outlaws right on the main page. The Bay Area is part of a revival of Roller Derby that is currently occurring. Seattle is another hotspot of activity. For myself, I had vague memory of women on roller skates knocking each other down from childhood TV but that was about it. It's back and we had a good time knee deep in cheap beer and kitsch. I took a number of pictures but it is hard to get a sense of the action from them. You can <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157594306894925/">look on Flickr</a> if you'd like. Otherwise, you can take a look at the video I shot with my camera. I shot it in 640 x 480 at 30 frames per second but Youtube samples it down a bit so it isn't quite a nice there. See the video at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pR6Qu9-VIrI">Youtube</a>.
