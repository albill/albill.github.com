I have just confirmed the truck for tomorrow morning. I'm picking up the
keys to the house in less than an house... I thought I'd post a reminder
notice. I e-mailed my friends who have confirmed but I certainly
wouldn't turn away anyone! ;-) So, for any of my unfortunate friends who
have volunteered to help me move: I have reserved a truck for 9:00 AM
tomorrow (Saturday). I figure that people should show up at 9:30 (the
truck rental is eight blocks from my apartment). So, 9:30 AM, July 20 at
1416 East Marion, \#201. That's between 14th and 15th on East Marion
(over east of Seattle U) for those that haven't come by my place before.
Most of my stuff is books really and I have the 1.5 cubic foot boxes so
they aren't super heavy. I have almost every boxed up already since I'll
be out of town until the night of 7/18. It'll be something like 25 or so
boxes of books, seven bookcases, a desk, a dresser, a futon sans frame
and probably 15 boxes of misc crap. I'm moving my computer on my own.
;-) I've spoken to most of you already but please let me know if you'll
be able to make it or not. I figure if we start at 9:30, we'll be done
loading the truck by 10:30 (seriously) and will start unloading at the
house by 11:00 or so. This should be a fairly quick move. The address of
the house is 9623 Roosevelt Way NE. It's the corner of 97th and
Roosevelt just south of Northgate Mall. E-mail me at memoria@memoria.com
to confirm or with questions.
