<p>This is a day for posting it seems.</p>
<p>There is another Grant Morrison interview online to go with the one I posted 
a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>Truthfully, the job security in this business is uncertain, the hours 
	are long, long and lonely, the audience is increasingly small, fickle and 
	dissatisfied, like 3 of the 7 Dwarves, respect is nonexistent, success 
	fleeting; you&#39;d be better off in a boy band, where at least you&#39;d get laid 
	before they made you obsolete. It&#39;s a miracle traditional American comics 
	get made at all (and still with the same characters they&#39;ve had since the 
	fucking Boer War or something. Mister Terrific! How can these things still 
	exist? What monstrous act of love and will keeps a comics &#39;universe&#39; alive 
	for so long, against the odds?). They&#39;re the last bastion of something, 
	that&#39;s for sure, but it&#39;s hard to imagine them, through the compound eyes of 
	future eons, as anything other than a curious example of primitive, 
	hand-drawn &#39;virtual reality&#39; technologies. Most of the people who do this 
	kind of work, do it out of love, like the love you&#39;d show to an ailing 
	friend.</i></p>
