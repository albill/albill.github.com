I've posted before about my opinion of the people that make their belief
in Peak Oil or the eventual collapse of civilization into a fetish. I
had a long basically flaming exchange with some people in comments on
the [Anthropik.com
blog](http://anthropik.com/2006/04/a-walk-and-decisions/) this evening
because certain people there seem to be gleefully anticipating and
hoping for the ending of civilization. This was further elaborated in
viewing selfishness as a virtue and that people only have any
responsbility **at all** to their own family. When did people lose any
sense of ethics or the basis of civilization? I have serious problems
with aspects of our culture but I believe in the value of communities,
order, and a developed sense of ethics towards all humans. I find it
appalling that people, especially of my own culture, don't have these
values at all. One thinks that if there were not police and prisons in
place, that there might be no restraint on behavior. They even admitted
that there would be nothing to stop the killing of others or even
violence and rape in their view of ethics. It's just a bit sad.
