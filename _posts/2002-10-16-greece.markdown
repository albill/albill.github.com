R and I are planning a trip to Greece for early next year. I always thought I'd go to Asia first but with my beginning Ancient Greek and my renewed interest in going to Grad School in areas relating to Hellenic religion and such, my priorities have shifted a bit. R has been wanting to go to Greece for a while now and has a friend who works for the United Nations stationed there somewhere.

We're planning on going at the end of March into early April for about two weeks. R found round-trip plane tickets for under $900 each, which is a pretty good deal. It goes up a lot a couple of weeks after we are planning on going but we're technically going in the rainy season. Being from Seattle and liking a temperate climate, I somehow don't think that the rainy season in Greece can be that bad...

I'm hoping to hit a number of the ancient sites like the various temple ruins and the like. I'm not sure if we'll make it out to any of the islands or not. I picked up the Lonely Planet guide for Greece last night as it seemed to have pretty good maps of towns, guides for places to stay, etc. I need to get a passport (I've never had one) in the near future. This will be my first time out of the country (unless you feel like counting Canada) and the first place where English isn't a native language.
