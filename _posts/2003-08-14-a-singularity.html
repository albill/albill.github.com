From William Blake via Ken MacLeod:
<blockquote>
1. Then the Inhabitants of those Cities:
Felt their Nerves change into Marrow
And hardening Bones began
In swift diseases and torments,
In throbbings &amp; shootings &amp; grindings
Thro' all the coasts; till weaken'd
The Senses inward rush'd shrinking,
Beneath the dark net of infection.....

7. The remaining sons of Urizen
Beheld their brethren shrink together
Beneath the Net of Urizen;
Perswasion was in vain;
For the ears of the inhabitants,
Were wither'd, &amp; deafen'd, &amp; cold:
And their eyes could not discern,
Their brethren of other cities.

8. So Fuzon call'd all together
The remaining children of Urizen:
And they left the pendulous earth:
They called it Egypt, &amp; left it.

9. And the salt ocean rolled englob'd.</blockquote>
-- William Blake, <strong>The Book of Urizen</strong>, Chapter IX.
