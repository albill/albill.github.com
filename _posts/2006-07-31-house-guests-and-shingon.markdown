My friend, Nathan, is staying with us as of yesterday. He arrived on the
train from Seattle the other week to work a contract job locally (he's a
sysadmin). It turns out that the mutual friend that he was staying with
decided to move at the end of the month so Nathan needed to find another
place to stay briefly. He's looking at apartments and I've passed his
resume around my work so there is a chance we'll wind up working
together (or at least in the same building). Nathan is one of my few
Buddhist friends, a student of Thrangu Rinpoche from the Karma Kagyu
Lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. Nathan is one of the lucky few people that
I get to have conversations with on Buddhist topics. He came with me for
the pet emergency on Saturday and we've had some lengthy conversations
on Buddhist topics (and others!) over the weekend. Hopefully, things
work out smoothly for him. There is also a fair chance that he'll be at
Burning Man this year as well. He has a ticket but given his work and
home situation, there are other priorities. It turns out he knows (and
hung out with last year) the people I've been in discussions with about
doing some ritual activities at Burning Man this year. Also, amusingly,
it turns out that he's been exposed to Shingon Buddhism, the other form
of esoteric Japanese Buddhism. Last year, at Burning Man, the Shingon
priest from the small Japanese temple in Seattle wound up at Burning Man
with a friend of Nathan's through happenstance. While there, he did the
goma fire ceremony following the temple burn on Sunday night. It was,
apparently, quite cool. The funny thing is that his temple is the same
one in Seattle that I had heard about but never seen. I bought an
obscure book on a Shingon ritual this last week and it was written by
this guy's bishop at their mother temple in Sacramento. This weekend, I
received a copy of a small booklet on a Shingon (and Tendai) meditation
practice that was written by the same fellow. The person who sent it to
me lives in Seattle and she bought it at an interfaith event from people
at the **same** Shingon temple in Seattle. So, that's three separate
instances this week of running into people and/or materials who are
derived from or related to this Shingon temple based out of Sacremento
with a branch in Seattle. Weird. Who would have thought that someone did
goma at Burning Man last year? :-)
