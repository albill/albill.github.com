<p>I've always really liked this essay by Michael Ventura. I think it speaks to the experience of a lot of people in this world. I posted it on a weblog a long time ago but I felt like doing so again.</p>
<h1 align="center"><b>Someone is stealing your life</b></h1>
<h2 align="center"><b>by Michael Ventura</b></h2>
<h3 align="center"><b>(Excerpted from LA Weekly 26-Jan-90) </b></h3>
<p>Most American adults wake around 6 to 7 in the morning. Get to work at 8 or 
9. Knock off around 5. Home again, 6-ish. Fifty weeks a year. For about 45 
years.</p>
<p>Most are glad to have the work, but don&#39;t really choose it. They may dream, 
they may study and even train for work they intensely want; but sooner or later, 
for most, that doesn&#39;t pan out. Then they take what they can and make do. Most 
have families to support, so they need their jobs more than their jobs admit to 
needing them. They&#39;re employees. And, as employees, most have no say whatsoever 
about much of anything on the job. The purpose or service, the short and 
long-term goals of the company, are considered quite literally &quot;none of their 
business&quot; - though these issues drastically influence every aspect of their 
lives. No matter that they&#39;ve given years to the day-to-day survival of the 
business; employees (even when they&#39;re called &quot;managers&quot;) mostly take orders. Or 
else. It seems an odd way to structure a free society: Most people have little 
or no authority over what they do five days a week for 45 years. Doesn&#39;t sound 
much like &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&quot; Sounds like a nation of 
drones.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It used to be that one&#39;s compensation for being an American drone was the 
freedom to live in one&#39;s own house, in one&#39;s own quirky way, in a clean and safe 
community in which your children had the chance to be happier, richer drones 
than you. But working stiffs can&#39;t afford houses now, fewer communities are 
clean, none are safe, and your kid&#39;s prospects are worse. (This condition may be 
because for five days a week, for 45 years, you had no say - while other people 
have been making decisions that haven&#39;t been good for you.) I&#39;m not sure whose 
happiness we&#39;ve been pursuing lately, but one thing is clear: It&#39;s not the 
happiness of those who&#39;ve done our society&#39;s work.</p>
<p>On the other hand - or so they say - you&#39;re free, and if you don&#39;t like your 
job you can pursue happiness by starting a business of your very own, by 
becoming an &quot;independent&quot; entrepreneur. But you&#39;re only as independent as your 
credit rating. And to compete in the business community, you&#39;ll find yourself 
having to treat others - your employees - as much like slaves as you can get 
away with. Pay them as little as they&#39;ll tolerate and give them no say in 
anything, because that&#39;s what&#39;s most efficient and profitable. Money is the 
absolute standard. Freedom, and the dignity and well-being of one&#39;s fellow 
creatures, simply don&#39;t figure in the basic formula.</p>
<p>This may seem a fairly harsh way to state the rules America now lives by. But 
if I sound radical, it&#39;s not from doing a lot of reading in some cozy 
university, then dashing off to dispense opinion as a prima donna of the 
alternative press. I learned about drones by droning. From ages 18 to 29 (minus 
a few distracted months at college when I was 24) I worked the sort of jobs that 
I expected to have all my life: typesetter for two years, tape transcriber for 
three, proofreader (a grossly incompetent one) for a few weeks, messenger for a 
few months, and secretary (yes, secretary) for a year and a half. Then I stopped 
working steadily and the jobs got funkier: hospital orderly, vacuum-cleaner 
salesman, Jack-in-the-Box counterperson, waiter, nail hammerer, cement mixer, 
toilet scrubber, driver.</p>
<p>It was during the years of office work that I caught on: I got two weeks&#39; 
paid vacation per year. A year has 52 weeks. Even a comparatively unskilled, 
uneducated worker like me, who couldn&#39;t (still can&#39;t) do fractions or long 
division - even I had enough math to figure that two goes into 52 ... how many 
times? Twenty-sic. Meaning it would take me 26 years on the job to accumulate 
one year for myself. And I could only have that in 26 pieces, so it wouldn&#39;t 
even feel like a year. In other words, no time was truly mine. My boss merely 
allowed me an illusion of freedom, a little space in which to catch my breath, 
in between the 50 weeks that I lived that he owned. My employer uses 26 years of 
my life for every year I get to keep. And what do I get in return for this 
enormous thing I am giving? What do I get in return for my life?</p>
<p>A paycheck that&#39;s as skimpy as they can get away with. If I&#39;m lucky, some 
health insurance. (If I&#39;m really lucky, the employer&#39;s definition of &quot;health&quot; 
will include my teeth and my eyes - maybe even my mind.) And, in a truly 
enlightened workplace, just enough pension or &quot;profit-sharing&quot; to keep me sweet 
but not enough to make life different. And that&#39;s it.</p>
<p>Compare this to what my employer gets: If the company is successful, he (it&#39;s 
usually a he) gets a standard of living beyond my wildest dreams, including what 
I would consider fantastic protection for his family, and a world of access that 
I can only pitifully mimic by changing channels on my TV. His standard of living 
wouldn&#39;t be possible without the labor of people like me - but my employer 
doesn&#39;t think that&#39;s a very significant fact. He certainly doesn&#39;t think that 
this fact entitles me to any say about the business. Not to mention a 
significant share in ownership. Oh no. The business is his to do with as he 
pleases, and he owns my work. Period.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t mean that bosses don&#39;t work. Most work hard, and have the 
satisfaction of knowing that what they do is theirs. Great. The problem is: What 
I do is theirs too. Yet if my companion workers and I didn&#39;t do what we do - 
then nobody would be anybody&#39;s. So how come what we do is hardly ours? How come 
he can get rich while we&#39;re lucky to break even? How come he can do anything he 
wants with the company without consulting us, yet we do the bulk of the work and 
take the brunt of the consequences?</p>
<p>The only answer provided is that the employer came up with the money to start 
the enterprise in the first place; hence, he and his money people decide 
everything and get all the benefits.</p>
<p>Excuse me, but that seems a little unbalanced. It doesn&#39;t take into account 
that nothing happens unless work is done. Shouldn&#39;t it follow that, work being 
so important, the doers of that work deserve a more just formula for measuring 
who gets what? There&#39;s no doubt that the people who risked or raised the money 
to form a company, or bail it out of trouble, deserve a fair return on their 
investment - but is it fair that they get everything? It takes more than 
investment and management to make a company live. It takes the labor, skill, and 
talent of the people who do the company&#39;s work. Isn&#39;t that an investment? 
Doesn&#39;t it deserve a fair return, a voice, a share of the power?</p>
<p>I know this sounds awfully simplistic, but no school ever taught me anything 
about the ways of economics and power (perhaps because they didn&#39;t want me to 
know), so I had to figure it out slowly, based on what I saw around me every 
day. And I saw:</p>
<p>That it didn&#39;t matter how long I worked or what a good job I did. I could get 
incremental raises, perhaps even medical benefits and a few bonuses, but I would 
not be allowed power over my own life - no power over the fundamental decisions 
on which my life depends. My future is in the hands of people whose names I 
often don&#39;t know and whom I never meet. Their investment is the only factor 
taken seriously. They feed on my work, on my life, but reserve for themselves 
all power, prerogative, and profit.</p>
<p>Slowly, very slowly, I came to a conclusion that for me was fundamental: My 
employers are stealing my life.</p>
<p>They. Are. Stealing. My. Life.</p>
<p>If the people who do the work don&#39;t own some part of the product, and don&#39;t 
have any power over what happens to their enterprise - they are being robbed. 
And don&#39;t think for a minute that those who are robbing you don&#39;t know they are 
robbing you. They know how much they get from you and how little they give back. 
They are thieves. They are stealing your life.</p>
<p>The assembly-line worker isn&#39;t responsible for the decimation of the American 
auto industry, for instance. Those responsible are those who&#39;ve been hurt least, 
executives and stockholders who, according to the Los Angeles Times, make 50 to 
500 times what the assembly-line worker makes, but who&#39;ve done a miserable job 
of managing. Yet it&#39;s the workers who suffer most. Layoffs, plant closings, and 
such are no doubt necessary - like the bumper stickers say, shit happens - but 
it is not necessary that workers have no power in the fundamental management 
decisions involved.</p>
<p>As a worker, I am not an &quot;operating cost.&quot; I am how the job gets done. I am 
the job. I am the company. Without me and my companion workers, there&#39;s nothing. 
I&#39;m willing to take my lumps in a world in which little is certain, but I 
deserve a say. Not just some cosmetic &quot;input,&quot; but significant power in good 
times or bad. A place at the table where decisions are made. Nothing less is 
fair. So nothing less is moral.</p>
<p>And if you, as owners or management or government, deny me this - then you 
are choosing not to be moral, and you are committing a crime against me. Do you 
expect me not to struggle?</p>
<p>Do you expect us to be forever passive while you get rich stealing our lives?
