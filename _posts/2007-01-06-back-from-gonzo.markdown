We just got back from seeing "<a href="http://www.gonzoduke.com/">Gonzo: A Brutal Chrysalis</a>" in San Francisco this evening.

This turned out to be a one man piece with the actor playing Hunter S. Thompson on stage by himself in Hunter's writing den. It progressed over a period of a number of years through episodes in Thompson's life, ending with him leaving to do his (in)famous Las Vegas trip.

I liked it though it was obviously a labor of love for those involved. The key actor (we are not told his name anywhere, only a pseudonym of "B. Duke") memorized roughly an hour and a half of material. When he stuck to his script, it worked pretty well. As R pointed out, some of his in-character improv from time to time was more strained but I thought that it was well done overall. We had a good time at the show.
