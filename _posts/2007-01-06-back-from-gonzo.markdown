We just got back from seeing "[Gonzo: A Brutal
Chrysalis](http://www.gonzoduke.com/)" in San Francisco this evening.
This turned out to be a one man piece with the actor playing Hunter S.
Thompson on stage by himself in Hunter's writing den. It progressed over
a period of a number of years through episodes in Thompson's life,
ending with him leaving to do his (in)famous Las Vegas trip. I liked it
though it was obviously a labor of love for those involved. The key
actor (we are not told his name anywhere, only a pseudonym of "B. Duke")
memorized roughly an hour and a half of material. When he stuck to his
script, it worked pretty well. As R pointed out, some of his
in-character improv from time to time was more strained but I thought
that it was well done overall. We had a good time at the show.
