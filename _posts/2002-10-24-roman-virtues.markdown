I found two lists of Roman Virtues that don't quite match. I should look
up the sources for these... Virtue is an interesting concept. Something
to be striven for, not something that is innate. The first list:

-   **Auctoritas**: "Spiritual Authority" The sense of one's social
    standing, built up through experience, Pietas, and Industria.
-   **Comitas**: "Humor" Ease of manner, courtesy, openness, and
    friendliness.
-   **Clementia**: "Mercy" Mildness and gentleness.
-   **Dignitas**: "Dignity" A sense of self-worth, personal pride.
-   **Firmitas**: "Tenacity" Strength of mind, the ability to stick to
    one's purpose.
-   **Frugalitas**: "Frugalness" Economy and simplicity of style,
    without being miserly.
-   **Gravitas**: "Gravity" A sense of the importance of the matter at
    hand, responsibility and earnestness.
-   **Honestas**: "Respectibility" The image that one presents as a
    respectable member of society.
-   **Humanitas**: "Humanity" Refinement, civilization, learning, and
    being cultured.
-   **Industria**: "Industriousness" Hard work.
-   **Pietas**: "Dutifulness" More than religious piety; a respect for
    the natural order socially, politically, and religiously. Includes
    the ideas of patriotism and devotion to others.
-   **Prudentia**: "Prudence" Foresight, wisdom, and personal
    discretion.
-   **Salubritas**: "Wholesomeness" Health and cleanliness.
-   **Severitas**: "Sternness" Gravity, self-control.
-   **Veritas**: "Truthfulness" Honesty in dealing with others.

The second list (which seems a bit more true to form as a list though
not as long): **Aequitas** *Fairness* Deal with both your enemies and
friends in the same manner. **Bonitas** *Goodness / generosity* Give
forth goodness and bounty from yourself as does the earth give forth her
bounty to you. **Comitas** *Politeness and Courtesy* Act with kindness
in pursuit of the common good. **Dignitas** *Sense of Worth* Honor the
sanctity of your being. **Firmitas** *Constancy* Stand strong and stand
long for Rome wasn't built in a day. **Gravitas** *Seriousness of
Purpose* Resolve to perform what you ought, perform without fail what
you resolve. (B. Franklin) **Honestas** *Respectability* In word and
deed, be tried and true. **Humanitas** *Humanity* Cultivate in the world
human nature for the nature of the human is community, kindness, and
wisdom. **Industria** *Industriousness* Put forth a steady effort to be
diligent in your work. **Mediocritas** *Moderation* Always follow the
middle way, vigilant of excess and lack, in voluntary simplicity.
**Pietas** *Sense of Duty* Perform without fail that which is due the
deities and the Whole. **Prudentia** *Prudence* In all your dealings
practice foresight and discretion. **Salubritas** *Wholesomeness*
Physical health and cleanliness promote spiritual health and growth.
**Securitas** *Peace of Mind* Though surrounded by pain or pleasure,
dwell always at the Point of Peace. **Veritas** *Truthfulness* Be ever
true to yourself, you beliefs, and your word **Thoughts on these?**
