I went camping this weekend, which I may write more about later, but I managed to get stung by a bee about, oh, 29 hours ago at a guess. Maybe longer. Today, I have this inflamed (not grossly but it's definitely bright pink) patch about an inch and a half by two inches around the site on my belly and it itches. It's got some mildly raised lines across it too but not beyond it.

I might be having a more severe reaction because I got stung for the first time in 25 years about a month ago and now just got stung again or I could have some raging infection that could kill me. According to the nurse, I should, by default, go to see a doctor. According to looking at medical sites online, it might be an acute reaction and, if it isn't getting any worse after 24 hours, it probably isn't... Who knows?

I just took some antihistamines so maybe that will help. I'd rather not go see a doctor for a bee sting of all things.
