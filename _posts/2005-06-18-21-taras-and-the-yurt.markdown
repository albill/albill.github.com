We're just home from the monthly Tara Circle over at Denny and Sophia's
place. We get together every month to do a group practice of **21
Taras** for victims of the tsunami in Asia this last year. We're doing
that for six months and then the group will probably shift gears to do a
different practice.

We always have a good time. Usually we hang out for a while talking and
then go back to their yurt at the back of the property. The yurt is hung
with textiles from their travels and time living in Asia. There is a
small shrine set up in a couple of places in the yurt. We light the
candles and incense, purify the space, take refuge and generate
bodhicitta and finally launch into the practice. We close it with a mala
round or two of the Tara mantra before dedication and closing.

Afterwards, we normally head down to the house for food, wine, and
conversation. We generally seem to get home around 11:00 or 11:30 so it
winds up being a full evening. Denny and Sophia are good people, as are
the other people in the group. There are normally only six of us total
for this with occasional visitors.

A wonderful set of images of the 21 Taras (or one version of the list of
them) is up at

Tomorrow, a couple of people are coming over for a few hours in the
afternoon. A friend of mine is teaching a series of somatic exercises
that are based on the four elements that he's been working with for a
few years. I had some initial training in the groundwork years ago but
he's been working with it a lot since then. I'm looking forward to this.

Meanwhile, I have papers due by next Friday for both of my classes so
I'll be focusing on those a lot this week...
