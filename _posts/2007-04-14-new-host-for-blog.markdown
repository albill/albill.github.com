If you're seeing this, then everything has updated to my new internet provider, <a href="http://www.site5.com">site5.com</a>, without too many issues. (We won't get into what I had to do to get the entire MySQL database to exist properly on the new site).

I've moved all of my domains over to site5 in the last 24 hours. If you run into any problems e-mailing me, try again later.

With my upcoming podcasting project and because I wanted a host that supports something more advanced than PHP4, I needed to move to a new provider after 11 years with <a href="http://www.pair.com">Pair.com</a>.

If your list of feed items somehow gets reset, this move is the cause but I don't think that will happen.
