(I feel like I'm writing a "what I did this summer" essay from Junior High...)

This last weekend, the evil and infamous R of no full name and I went to Port Angeles for an overnight, get-the-fuck-out-of-town, trip.

We drove out Saturday morning, caught the noonish ferry to Kingston and then drove to Port Angeles. I always forget that it really isn&apos;t that long of a drive out there. We got there in about two hours or so total (I think) and checked into the cheap, slightly scary but fairly clean, motel that R had made reservations in for us. We then drove up to Hurricane Ridge, which R had never visited before. For those that don&apos;t know, it is just outside of Port Angeles but about 5,000 feet straight up along a very winding road. The last time I visited it was back in 1998 or somesuch with and her then husband. I remembered it being very windy with open meadows, very long drops to death and deer... On the way up this time, I noticed that there seemed to be a lot of deer along the road eating grass, which seemed odd since they were all at the top before. Once we got to the top and saw the literally 15 or 20 feet of snow piled up in places, it became very clear the winter was still in session on the ridge. Coolness.

R took me to the nicest dinner I've probably had in the last six months or more at an Italian place. We walked into this place and they asked us if we'd made reservations. heh. We never even thought about that given that we were in Port Angeles, a podunk town in our minds. We wound up getting the best seats, a table for two right next to the window, that had had a "reserved" sign on it before we arrived. I had an excellent and artful Tuscan steak and R had a pasta dish.

We had made all kinds of plans for what to do after dinner but, truth be told, we cheesed out on them and went and saw "The Scorpion King" starring The Rock. It was pretty silly but a fun movie. I do think that I liked Blade II better but I'm more of a death and vampires kind of guy that Conan the Unstoppable type these days.

Next morning was a wonderful breakfast and then a return to the big city...

I continue to be amazed at how the resumption of my relationship with R is going. We speak about the "in-between" time now in reference to the months that we were completely broken up. I'm not sure what kind of relationship it will grow into but it feels strong, stronger than it felt during the last couple of months before it ended before.
