I found a video this morning that is a trailer for Neal Stepheson's <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anathem-Neal-Stephenson/dp/0061474096/">Anathem</a></strong> (which I reviewed <a href="http://www.arcanology.com/2008/08/21/neal-stephensons-anathem-reviewed/">here</a>). I believe it was officially produced and the scenes in it reflect those in the novel. I mention it here because it is interesting but also because you can hear pieces of three or so of the songs that I have <a href="http://www.arcanology.com/2008/06/24/anathem-and-music/">mentioned before</a> in the background.

I am going to the <a href="http://www.longnow.org/anathem/">San Francisco release party</a> that the Long Now Foundation is hosting next Tuesday, which is the same day that the book comes out. Neal Stephenson will be there and they will be performing some of the music as well. It should be a lot of fun.
