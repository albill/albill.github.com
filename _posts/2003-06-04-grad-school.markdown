So, as some of you may remember, I've been looking at going to Grad
School but have to leave the nice paying job and now getting a house and
soon getting married kind of get in the way of that (not to mention the
lack of jobs for academics). [Naropa University](http://www.naropa.edu)
has an online program that includes a couple of MA options. It turns out
that they'll have an MA in Buddhist Studies soon, which would be of
interest since I was planning on doing graduate work in religious
studies and this area is one of my interests. I could also use this as a
springboard to a Religious Studies PhD later. I've written to them to
ask for their timeline but I think I'll be watching this one.
