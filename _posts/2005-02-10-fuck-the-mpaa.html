Hmmm...I guess this is &quot;Hey MPAA, fuck you!&quot; from me. While I understand where they are coming from, no one likes the self-righteous.

<a href="http://www.lokitorrent.com/">http://www.lokitorrent.com/</a> now displays the following, which means that I suppose they lost their court fight:

<h3 align="center"><font color="#FF0000">There are websites that provide legal 
downloads. This is not one of them.</font></h3>
<h3 align="center">This website has been permanently shut down by court order 
because it facilitates the illegal downloading of copyrighted motion pictures. 
The illegal downloading of motion pictures robs thousands of honest, 
hard-working people of their livelihood, and stifles creativity. Illegally 
downloading movies from sites such as these without proper authorization 
violates the law, is theft, and is not anonymous. Stealing movies leaves a 
trail. The only way not to get caught is to stop.</h3>
