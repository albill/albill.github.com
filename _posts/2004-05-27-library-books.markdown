I have a strange, nigh uncontrollable desire, to take <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0812238087/">Understanding Terror Networks</a></strong> and apply the principles in it to a paper on the cell structure of the revolutionary network of <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1563892677">The Invisibles</a></strong>. Does this strike anyone as wrong? I figure if it can apply to Al-Qaeda, it can apply to King Mob and friends... It would be interesting to do as a faux academic paper and to then submit it to some Homeland Security conference.

This is something like, in some eras, finding the private chapel of Calvin with a Latin Bible, a Bishop's mitre and a crucifex in it. Generally frowned upon in history for Gelugpa monks, which the Dalai Lama was the one of the heads of...

That gives me a four day weekend. R and I are renting a cabin overnight on Friday at a lake near Everett. It's sealed from the elements, has a fireplace and power. It ought to be fun and cozy. I'll get some reading in and some quality time with the near-missus.
