This is so cool that I want one even though I don't have an immediate
use!

so much to the TraxData TravelStudio that it's hard to know where to
begin. Here you have a portable device which can read almost any media
(CF-I and II, SD, MD, MS, MS Pro, MMC, CD, DVD) connect to any TV or PC
and play many media formats (DVD, VCD, MP3, JPG, MPEG, WAV) *and* burn
CDs as well. There are obviously many uses for such a device, but it
would really be swank if it included a hard drive and played DiVXâ€”take
your DVDs with you, without actually carting around a library of DVDs
(or a laptop). Not bad at $400, but no word on whether TraxData's US
distributor will be bringing them stateside.
