Tonight is our last night in Tulum, Mexico. We'll spend the night here
and then drive to the ruins of Coba in the morning. Following that,
we're driving to Merida, the capitol of the Yucatan province. Today, we
took things casually. Mostly we swam, hung out at the bungalow and got
massages. In a little while, we're going to a sweat lodge run at the
site here. I've uploaded a bunch of pictures from the first two days to
[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/). Here is one:
