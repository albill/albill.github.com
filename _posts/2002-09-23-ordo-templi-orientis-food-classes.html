R and I attended Gnostic Mass at Horizon Oasis today. We were there to see our friend  baptized, another fellow confirmed, a third person ordained a deacon and  first celebration of the mass at Priestess. All went well and Brandy did a most excellent job. I'm glad to see the community doing things of value and people so happy.

Last night we attended the annual Fall Thing, which is a local OTO fundraising event. Horizon is trying to raise funds to get its own space. We attended a well done production of the Rite of Mercury, participated in a raffle and got to play the infamous Hebrew Bingo with Disco Stu running things. I had an excellent time even without the ability to eat almost any of the food there.

On that note, I will say that I've lost something like 15 or so pounds in the last two weeks since I started the Atkins Diet and have had no ill effects from it so far. Certain body rhythms have changed that I never knew could (when I get tired, the way I feel before and after I eat, timing of things) but I think my body is doing fairly well with it. I plan on losing another 15 or 20 pounds on this diet. While I am a pretty big framed guy so I carry it well (I just get a bit of a belly but not a huge one), I've been about 30 to 40 pounds overweight (up and down ten or so) for about six or seven years now since I started computer work. I plan on getting to a leaner edge and then beginning the process of adding carbs and such back into my diet so I maintain myself around my optimum weight.

In about a week and a half, it looks like I'll begin taking Ancient Greek in the evenings twice a week. We'll see how that goes with work and all. If I ever do want to Graduate school, it will probably be necessary.
