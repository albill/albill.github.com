An interesting review from the Village Voice on why <b>The Da Vinci Code</b> seems to strike a nerve with many people. (<a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/vls/182/white.shtml">http://www.villagevoice.com/vls/182/white.shtml</a>):<blockquote>What <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> has created should
interest us, but not because Brown is right about Da Vinci or the
infamies of the Catholic Church or powerful secret societies or the
real role of Mary Magdalene as apostle and lover to the Christ. <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>
is important as an expression of a desire for a spirituality that
cannot be had within the confines of the institutionalized church. More
simply yet, it is the popular expression of a desire for a kind of
meaningfulness to life that is missing for most of us. And certainly,
it is the scandalous expression of a willingness to be disobedient to
achieve the heretical end of a salvation outside the confines of the
church. Through this novel we express our fundamental disgust with our
institutionalized lives, and we suggest shocking things that we might
previously have imagined were unsayable. The novel offers the
unexpected opportunity to flee the dominant culture of
Truths-That-Make-No-Sense for the Secret, the Unsayable, and the True.
From my point of view, there's nothing wrong with imagining that
something's fraudulent about the way our lives are ordered, nothing
wrong with wanting to go beyond the illusory in order to know the
truth. Beyond the scandal and the sensation and the heavy-handed
fiction, it is this assumption of our shared sense of spiritual fraud
and the assumption that we're willing to think heretically in order to
escape that fraud that makes Brown's deepest appeal to his readers. He
promises us liberation, and our eagerness to take up his offer reveals
much about our spiritual as well as our political condition.</blockquote>
