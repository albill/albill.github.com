<p>The new pope seems to think he understands the causes of World War II. It is Neo-Paganism!</p><blockquote>'And in the twentieth century, in the darkest period of German and European history, an insane racist ideology, born of neo-paganism, gave rise to the attempt, planned and systematically carried out by the regime, to exterminate European Jewry. '</blockquote><p> - Pope Benedict, Cologne, August 05</p>
