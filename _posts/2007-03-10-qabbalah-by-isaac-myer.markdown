For my thesis work, I've come across a book (well, actually, I've had it
for some time but...) by one Isaac Myer, LL. B. It is called :

## Qabbalah

* * * * *

## The Philosophical Writings

of

Solomon Ben Yehudah Ibn Gebirol

or

### Avicebron

And their connection with the Hebrew Qabbalah and Sepher ha-Zohar, with
remarks upon the antiquity and content of the latter, and translations
of selected passages from the same.

Also

### An Ancient Lodge of Initiates,

Translated from the Zohar

And an abstract of an Essay upon the Chinese Qabbalah, contained in the
book called the Yih King; a translation of party of the Mystic Theology
of Dionysos, The Areopagite; and an account of the construction of the
ancient Akkadian and Chaldean Universe, etc. Accompanied by Diagrams and
Illustrations

This book was published in 1888 and seems to have been associated with
the Theosophical Society in London. It was reviewed in their magazine,
Lucifer, with this review contained in the introduction to the copy that
I have. It is mostly translation and commentary on the Zohar but I have
no idea of the background or credentials of Isaac Myer or his connection
to Theosophy. The review from the magazine simply states that he is a
resident of Philadelphia in the United States and a Mason. Given the
remarks about the New Testament, I assume that he was a Christian as
well but maybe a convert.

Given the timing and the connection of both MacGregor Mathers and
William Westcott to the Theosophical Society, I do wonder if it
influenced any of the early Golden Dawn work. Both Mathers and Westcott
wrote articles on Kabbalah and gave lectures, often to members of the
Theosophical Society, during the late 1880's.

If any of my readers know much about this work, I'd love to hear more.
