I bought tickets last year but wound up selling them to a friend in order for R and I to take our trip to Japan instead. That seemed like a pretty good decision and still does. I did go to Burning Man the previous year, in 2006, and wound up camping with friends of friends (or acquaintances). That was ok but turned out to be a bit more drama filled that I appreciated. R hasn't been to Burning Man since our trip with the Chupacabra Policia in 2001. That was also, strangely enough, drama filled. Basically, whenever you get attached to camping with a group of people that you don't know terribly well, drama seems to ensue. I wanted to go again this year, doing it as an every other year or so thing, but I wanted R to go with me. Otherwise, it is a lot less fun. (My wife is my best friend after all!) She agreed so I got tickets for us when they went on sale yesterday. The vague plan right now is to camp on our own. I'd be willing to camp with other people but I want to avoid drama, for once, and have a good time. If someone had an interesting enough project, I'd like to help but I don't know if I'm going to try for something super creative on my own. I was looking at cheap (and I mean "cheap!!!") vans and such yesterday. I may get a vehicle, get it worked on by a mechanic, and turn it into the anchor piece for our camping area. I'm getting a little tired of the dusty BM tent and storm experience. A few whiteouts teaches you the joy of having doors that seal. If any friends or acquaintances are going this year, I'd love to hear about it.
