On Thursday night, R, her mother, and I went to one of the first
performances of
"[Firebird](http://www.thecrucible.org/ballet/index.html)" at the
[Crucible](http://www.thecrucible.org/) in Oakland. This show is an
interpretation of [Stravinsky's
Firebird](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Firebird) done with a
combination of fire performances, aerial work, ballet and break dancing.
It also included stunt work with a motorcycle and an impressive Pontiac
Firebird. For those that are unaware, the Crucible is a non-profit arts
center in Oakland dedicated various fire related and industrial forms of
art. It was founded by a number of Burning Man artists in 1999 and
offers classing in various kinds of metal casting, welding, fabrication,
neon work, and sculpture. If you want to learn to weld, cast sculptures,
or make things that shoot flames, they are a place to learn these
skills. Every year, in Spring, they do a show focusing on dance and
fire. In the Summer, they host a fire arts festival. R and I attended
one of their festivals when we lived in our old place, about three
blocks away, and attended their dance performance, a retelling of
**Romeo and Juliet**, last year. I thought that the show this year was
excellent and was actually better done than the show last year, which I
liked as well. We brought R's mother with us this year and she really
enjoyed the show as well, so it isn't just for Burning Man freaks going
out to the playa. I encourage people interested to go to the links above
and get tickets for the show. It is going on this weekend and next
(April 16 through 19).
