It is with only a minor feeling of dread that I make this announcement:
For the few that have an interest in my Master's thesis, I've made a
book form of it available on lulu.com.

It is relatively short because of the guidelines for my program and I
could have gone on at much greater length (ask me sometime about the
twenty page fifth chapter that I removed or the whole section on
talismans that was excised). For my occultist or cabalistic friends,
many of the details will be old hat. Overall, chapters are kept to a
fairly concise level without going off in all possible directions. With
these caveats in mind, [it is
available](http://www.lulu.com/content/1876937). I've made the PDF file
of it freely available to anyone. There is a print version of it as
well. The cost for that is the base lulu.com price. I'm not getting a
single penny in return for any purchased copies. The print version is
largely so that a few people, like my mother, can get decently bound
copies of the thesis. For most othes, the PDF file will suffice. I did
purchase a copy of my own thesis (it is, indeed, a sad world) so I could
make sure that the page flow, formatting, etc. was correct in book form.
On the basis of that, I made a few changes (adding some blank pages in a
couple of places and reformatting my table of contents) and also created
a much prettier cover.
