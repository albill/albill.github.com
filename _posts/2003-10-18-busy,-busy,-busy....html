My work has been really busy lately. We've finally had the reorganization that we've been waiting for so my boss is now (as of today) only responsible for one giant ass team instead of two. Since shit flows downhill, this will probably make my life a little saner even though my own org that I run is ten people with nine of them reporting directly to me. I wound up in a scheduling and planning meeting yesterday. It was supposed to be about an hour to an hour and a half long. It worked out to four hours, 38 minutes... All in one meeting though we wound up meeting in three rooms (because we weren't scheduled), had to steal batteries for laptops and took ten minutes together for lunch. I could do without that again for a while but we got a lot done. For once, I actually felt like I had some serious say in the test process and our schedule. Sarastro came over two nights ago to do some ritual work relating to the Astrum Sophia. We got a bit done, made some more plans for future work and continued to talk about where our group is going and what we want to do in regards to it. With working with him on degree specific stuff and our general meetings, I'll be meeting with people for this four times a month... Last night, I went out and had dinner and bear with Shade and Denny, the Horus-Maat comedy team. It was good to get out with them. The two of them have known each other since they were teenagers and have been doing magic for over 30 years. It's always refreshing to meet people who have been doing a work for that long and to get to talk to them about it. Definately a thought-provoking conversation along with the Cthulhu humor... Tomorrow, my mother is coming into town for her lecture on Nuit on Sunday and her ritual performance of the Vespers of Nuit the following Sunday. She'll be staying with us for at least a couple of days during the week she's here. I'm looking forward to seeing her. <strong>I'm planning to have a dinner thing next Wednesday at some as-yet-undetermined restaurant in Seattle. I want to invite any and all of the Seattle magical crowd to come and meet her and chat if they are interested.</strong>
