![The purple alloy of copper and
antimony.](http://www.arcanology.com/images/WilliamNewman3.gif)This is a
pretty cool site:
[http://www.indiana.edu/\~college/WilliamNewmanProject.shtml](http://www.indiana.edu/~college/WilliamNewmanProject.shtml).
William Newman, a professor who has written several interesting
scholastic books looking at the origins of chemistry as a science in
alchemical thought and the people that played a role in it, has been
conducting experiments replicating alchemical work. He's following notes
and plans from Isaac Newton to look at the results produced by Newton's
alchemical experiments. The page has many pictures and I find it quite
refreshing to see a chemist not following the example of people from
previous decades who liked to pretend that Newton's alchemical work
either didn't exist or were just ravings as his sanity became
questionable later in life or somesuch. In Newman's own words, from the
page:

> I am at present deciphering Isaac Newton's chymical laboratory
> notebooks and manuscripts, the subject of a forthcoming BBC/NOVA
> documentary, much of which was filmed at IU. Newton spent some thirty
> years working on chymistry, and yet the goals of his project and their
> relationship to his physics and religion remain obscure. One thing is
> clear, however. Newton based his research heavily on the work of
> "Eirenaeus Philalethes" or George Starkey, about whom I have written
> extensively. Hence my background in Starkey's work gives me an
> important Ariadne's thread into the labyrinth of Newton's alchemy, and
> one that I am busily exploiting. At the same time, Newton left clear
> directions for making chymical furnaces and other apparatus, as well
> as processes for the star regulus of antimony, a copper-antimony alloy
> called "the net," and other products of the laboratory. He also wrote
> a manuscript discussing metallic "vegetation," the formation of
> dendrites from salts and metals. To Newton, the fact that metals could
> be made to grow in a flask was a sign that they possessed a sort of
> life, and could therefore be made to ferment, putrefy, and ultimately
> multiply.
