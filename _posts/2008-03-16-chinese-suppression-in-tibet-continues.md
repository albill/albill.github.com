I'm not even go to post most of the current details of the situation in Tibet right now. The are everywhere for those paying attention. 

The violence in Tibet continues. While the reports that I've heard have said that Chinese troops have managed to contain the rioting and protests in Lhasa (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSL1548087020080316">with roughly 80 to 100 dead</a>), the protests have been spreading to other areas. The Christian Science Monitor <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0317/p10s01-wosc.html">reports</a> that 20,000 Chinese troops have flooded Lhasa.  <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSSP10739920080316?sp=true">Reuters</a> has fairly up to the minute news on events as well.

I did note that the Chinese government's pet Panchen Lama (not the real one) has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSPEK27258120080316?sp=true">criticized the protests and riots</a> on television in Tibet but stopped short of criticizing the Dalai Lama.

For his part, the Dalai Lama is taking a stronger stance (and using much stronger language) than he has in the last few years of attempting to work with the Chinese authorities. The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/world/asia/16cnd-tibet.html?_r=1&ref=world&oref=slogin">reports</a>  that he answered questions for an hour today (Sunday).  Among the things said, were the following:
<blockquote>Asked if he could stop Tibetan protesters from flouting Beijing’s deadline to surrender by midnight on Monday, the Dalai Lama, 72, replied swiftly: “I have no such power.”

He said he had received a call on Saturday from Tibet. “‘Please don’t ask us to stop,’” was the caller’s request. The Dalai Lama promised he would not, even though he said he expected the Chinese authorities to put down the protests with force.

“Now we really need miracle power,” he said, and then laughed. “But miracle seems unrealistic.”

[...]

He accused Chinese officials of resorting only to force when confronted with a crisis. “They have no experience how to deal with problems through talk, only suppress,” he said.

Asked several times whether he endorsed the protests, which had at times had turned violent over the last week, the Dalai Lama said Tibetans were entitled to air their grievances peacefully. “Protest, peaceful way, express their deep resentment is a right,” he said.

He said he was aware that the Chinese government blamed him for fomenting rebellion. “I’m happy they found some scapegoat,” he said, in half-jest, and then described what he said were deep-rooted grievances.

“Whether the Chinese government admits it or not, there is a problem. The problem is a nation with ancient cultural heritage is actually facing serious dangers,” he said. “Whether intentionally or unintentionally, some kind of cultural genocide is taking place.”</blockquote>
I don't think I've heard the Dalai Lama actually say "cultural genocide" before, as true as it is.

All of this saddens my heart. I was going to post on other things this weekend but, in the face of all of this, most of it is quite trivial.

<strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://cryptome.cn/">Cryptome CN</a> has photos available that people have gathered of events from the last few days:
