<img src="http://burningcity.com/Chrome_Web_Images/Chrome_poster.jpg" border="1" align="right">They made a play out of <b>Burning Chrome</b> a few years back and it seems to have worked out well. Weird.

<blockquote><b><font color="#006699">Mr. Charlie Athanas</font></b><font color="#006699">, our sometime poster artist, and an old school chum of mine, brought the idea of staging a William Gibson story to us almost ten years ago, and we are delighted to be a part of what I know for him is a small dream come true. I think you will be able to judge his enthusiasm for this author from the special toys he has designed for the production. Charlie and <b>Jim Currie</b> from the <b>Evanston Research Park Incubator</b> also have worked many, many weeks together inviting technological companies from the Park to participate in this project. So, it is directly due to them that we have this rather amazing group of new sponsors and advisors from our community for Burning Chrome. And I don't think we could ever thank them properly for it.</font></blockquote>
