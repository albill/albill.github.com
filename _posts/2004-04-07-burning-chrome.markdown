![image](http://burningcity.com/Chrome_Web_Images/Chrome_poster.jpg)They
made a play out of **Burning Chrome** a few years back and it seems to
have worked out well. Weird.

> **Mr. Charlie Athanas**, our sometime poster artist, and an old school
> chum of mine, brought the idea of staging a William Gibson story to us
> almost ten years ago, and we are delighted to be a part of what I know
> for him is a small dream come true. I think you will be able to judge
> his enthusiasm for this author from the special toys he has designed
> for the production. Charlie and **Jim Currie** from the **Evanston
> Research Park Incubator** also have worked many, many weeks together
> inviting technological companies from the Park to participate in this
> project. So, it is directly due to them that we have this rather
> amazing group of new sponsors and advisors from our community for
> Burning Chrome. And I don't think we could ever thank them properly
> for it.
