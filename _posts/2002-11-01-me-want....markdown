Inside, the colors are the same, only softer. A bank of steel elevators open onto a sea of gray cubes, the hallways are painted a light blue. And on a corner table of Roy Want's fifth-floor lab is a silvery lava lamp, blowing bright blue bubbles. Aside from a yellow water bottle tucked under a desk, it is the only splash of color in a windowless room of computer terminals and dry erase boards. Still, he pushes the bubbling blue lamp aside to make room for a PowerPoint display loaded inside his laptop. Want is a principal engineer in Intel's ubiquitous computing project. That means he's trying to connect people to each other and to the Internet wherever they are and whenever they want. He'd doing it with a device no bigger than a deck of cards that he calls a Personal Server. It's a circuit board with two processor chips, a memory card, a Bluetooth radio chip and all the software to make it work. Weighing no more than a cell phone, it's a personal computer minus the keyboard and display that runs on a lithium ion battery for about five hours before it needs to be charged. While the slide presentation boots up, he pushes his sandy blonde hair out of his eyes. He's a geek, with a slight British accent, laughing at his own pocket protector jokes. There's a sign reminding his engineers of the University of Washington's computer science TV show, on every Wednesday at 10 a.m. Work-flow charts and things-to-do lists cover the walls. He's approachable, in khakis and a red shirt, and serious about his work. Though Want joined Intel Research two years ago and found internal funding for his project six months later, he began his research in ubiquitous computing in the late 1980s at Olivetti Research. After finishing his Ph.D. in computer science at Cambridge University, he joined Olivetti where, in an era before the cell phone he began developing smart phones. Olivetti's smart phone system could locate a person within the building and then route his call to the nearest phone. Later, at Xerox PARC Want's team created and built a computer that was not only aware of its location, but also of the people and devices sharing the same space. It could communicate wirelessly with the other workstations to, for example, print documents to the nearest printer. (...the rest is unavailable without paying...)

In looking at ways to improve mobile computing, we focused on three technologies, which in combination, offer a potential solution: high-density, small volume storage; low-power, high-performance processors, such as StrongARM and XScale; and standardized, high-bandwidth radios, such as Bluetooth. The personal server represents the integration of these three technologies. It's a small, mobile device that eventually will hold most of the data you use from day to day. It has none of the standard physical input/output capabilities â€” no keyboard, buttons or display. For this purpose, it relies on the computing infrastructure that happens to be in the locality and short-range wireless-connections to make use of these resources. A simple way to think about the concept is to ask this question: What makes your PC your PC? The answer is that it's just the hard disk, which contains your data; the rest is simply the access device. Using the personal server concept, we're virtualizing the hard disk through a wireless connection to whatever computing device is nearby and available.
