have cake!

Tonight, R and I attended the 10th Anniversary Part for Mozilla at the
[111 Minna Gallery](http://www.111minnagallery.com/) in San Francisco.
There was quite a crowd there from Mozilla past as well as present. I
didn't get a good count but the place was packed wall to wall. It was
enough that I did not manage to circulate from one end of the room to
the other until we decided to leave.
[Mitchell](http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/),
[Brendan](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/), and
[Shaver](http://shaver.off.net/diary/) all did a little speechifying for
the masses and then the party continued. Strangely enough, [Frank
Chu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Chu) was also present... This
led to a few conversations about our local icon/nutter.

Because I can, I must include the obligatory post of my QA peeps from
MoCo:

Stephen *"Pillsy"* Donner and Juan *"Hoooo-on"* Becerra\
 (with Gary *"Dazed and Confused"* Kwong)

*Stephen and Juan have worked with me on the QA for most of the Firefox
and Thunderbird security releases for the last six months. For that
alone, they should be called out.* Oh, and me, courtesy of [Paul
Kim](http://www.numenity.org/blog/):

The party was a lot of fun and I'm glad that everyone got a chance to
celebrate 10 years of Mozilla. Mitchell had a [good post about it
earlier
today](http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2008/03/31/mozilla-turns-10-today/)
for those that don't know what's going on.
