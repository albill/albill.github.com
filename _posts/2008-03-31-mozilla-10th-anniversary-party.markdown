There was quite a crowd there from Mozilla past as well as present. I didn't get a good count but the place was packed wall to wall. It was enough that I did not manage to circulate from one end of the room to the other until we decided to leave. <a href="http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/">Mitchell</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/">Brendan</a>, and <a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/">Shaver</a> all did a little speechifying for the masses and then the party continued. Strangely enough, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Chu">Frank Chu</a> was also present... This led to a few conversations about our local icon/nutter. <p align="center">
