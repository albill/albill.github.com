"Often a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and
the other parts of the world, about the motions and orbits of the stars
and even their sizes and distances,... and this knowledge he holds with
certainty from reason and experience. It is thus offensive and
disgraceful for an unbeliever to hear a Christian talk nonsense about
such things, claiming that what he is saying is based in Scripture. We
should do all that we can to avoid such an embarrassing situation, lest
the unbeliever see only ignorance in the Christian and laugh to scorn."
-- St. Augustine, "De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim" (The Literal
Meaning of Genesis)
