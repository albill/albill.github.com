The Two Towers of Microsoft and Palm...I bought a Palm Tungsten C via Ebay last night (and got it for about half of the list price, which seems fair) so I&apos;m going to finally have a device made by someone other than my employer (or indirectly my employer). 

When it comes down to it, I got it because it has built-in WiFi, a built-in keyboard, and decent software available. I&apos;ve also heard that it should be upgradeable to next rev of the Palm OS which is supposed to be a big shift.

I&apos;ll probably get a real keyboard to use with it when I want to do some real typing though.

R and I watched the first DVD (of two) of the extended <b>Two Towers</b> movie last night. We may watch the second half tonight. So far, I&apos;m enjoying the scenes that have been added or extended in it. It helps the movie quite a bit in my opinion.

R and I are also starting to make plans to go to <a href="http://www.pantheacon.com">PantheaCon</a> this coming February. I went in 2001 and had an excellent time and people have continued to recommend that we go to it. We&apos;re just figuring out the finances end of it now.
