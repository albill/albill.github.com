Today was ritual day in the evening. The Ouroboros gang came over and we did a nice solar rite. Beyond that, we also practiced our basketball marksmanship on the inherited net that came with the house. Madeline came over today as well and she, R, and myself did a little golf putting in the back yard. That&apos;s when I realized that I need a full on croquet set. We have a large and flat enough back yard for one. I think this is a necessary thing and I vow to obtain one. Notocon is in a few more weeks and then its my birfday!!
