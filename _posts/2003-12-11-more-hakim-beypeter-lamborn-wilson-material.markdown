    Wilson reads the remarkable political constitution of one of
    northeastern India's indigenous nations.
-   [Ayahuasca
    Reading](http://www.hermetic.com/bey/ayahuasca-reading.html)

to [Hakim Bey and Ontological
Anarchy](http://www.hermetic.com/bey/index.html). Busy busy busy... I
wish I had archived the full **Pirate Utopias** book when Ibbey had it
online. I didn't because he had it on his site and, needless to say, he
is gone and yet I remain. I should point out that Peter has openly told
people that he wants his stuff disseminated so I'm not violating his
copyright. I was, after all, the person who, with permission, first
cleaned up and posted the ASCII of **TAZ** to Usenet over ten years ago.
