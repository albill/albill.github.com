My new term in school started on Monday, May 1. This term I am only
taking a single class, which is on Rousseau and the Enlightenment. Along
with reading Rousseau's confessions and a number of his political works,
we are also reading [**Candide**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candide)
by Voltaire. In fact, we are starting the class with it, which actually
seems to be a bit of a good thing. I am about 10% through it (which is
to say twenty pages), having started this evening. I must say I find
Voltaire to be quite funny and charmy. This is probably the most ribald
thing I've read in ages. From the references to the philosopher Pangloss
engaging in "experimental physics" with the maid to prove cause and
effect to the scandalous comments about Catholicism and Kings. I am
quite surprised that Voltaire was never assassinated by someone. Given
the era that he wrote he, I can see why he gained the reputation that
lasts to today.
