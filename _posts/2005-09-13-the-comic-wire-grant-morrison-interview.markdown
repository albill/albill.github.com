This was pointed out to me this evening. I hadn't seen it before.

> **GRANT MORRISON TALKS WITH FANS AT MELTDOWN HOLLYWOOD** \
>  *by [Andy Khouri](mailto:andy@comicbookresources.com), Contributing
> Writer* \
>  Posted: April 1, 2005
>
> A very unique gathering of assorted humans occurred Thursday night in
> Hollywood, California. Approximately one-hundred or so hipsters,
> hippies, geeks, bikers, punks, nerds, burnouts, freaks, mutants,
> celebrities and terribly normals affected a cease fire in the brutal
> pop culture wars of the second millennium and communed peacefully in
> the long box rows of [Meltdown Comics](http://www.meltcomics.com/) to
> hear what master comics writer and practicing magician [Grant
> Morrison](http://www.grant-morrison.com/) had to say.
>
> Morrison's eclectic flock of fans -- many of whom might possibly never
> be caught dead in even the same men's room together -- included fellow
> comics scribe Joe Casey ("Wildcats," "The Intimates"), Hollywood
> producer Don Murphy ("LXG," "From Hell") and UK pop star Robbie
> Williams. Naturally, CBR News was on hand to steal souls (snap pics)
> and record the evening's highlights for our readers.
>
> Co-presenting the event with Meltdown was national counterculture
> periodical [Arthur](http://www.arthurmag.com/), with editor Jay
> Babcock bravely wrangling the mass of dissidents and moderating the
> Q&A.
>
> As one might expect, much of the discussion centered on what is sure
> to be the writer's most mainstream exposure to date, "All-Star
> Superman," Morrison's forthcoming twelve issue DC Comics series with
> frequent collaborator Frank Quitely.
>
> Characterizing the sixty year old American icon as a God and kind of
> solar consciousness, Morrison simultaneously lamented the loss of
> Superman's "human connection," citing with great praise the work of
> legendary DC Comics editor Mort Weisinger, whose personal issues
> Morrison felt were overtly reflected in the pages of the books
> Weisinger edited. Morrison enthralled his freakish audience with
> synopsis of a number of Weisinger classics (or at least,
> now-classics), including an amazing story in which Superman found
> himself with a new power that while fantastic, afflicted him with a
> terrible exhaustion. Morrison explained how the plot had you guessing
> until finally revealing that the Man of Steel's new power was to
> produce a tiny little Superman from his palm who would fly up into the
> sky and rescue failing aircraft. "This new power has rendered me
> useless!" Morrison said of Superman's thoughts on the matter. "Nobody
> loves me anymore, they just love my SUPER-IMP!"
>
> "Take that, Sigmund!" Morrison laughed.
>
> Of course, the lines between solar consciousness, super-imps and magic
> are decidedly thin, and as such, the discussion often returned
> throughout the evening to Morrison's long association with the occult.
> A practicing magician since 1978, Morrison was heavily influenced by
> an uncle. "A man so committed to magic," Morrison explained, "he
> believed if you couldn't grow back a severed arm, you weren't really a
> magician!"
>
> Morrison then proceeded to regale the crowd with his now legendary
> contact experience in the hills of Katmandu: that while lying in bed,
> he was visited by shiny silver anti-bodies from the 5th dimension, an
> experience he described as "being electrocuted by god," and something
> that "no drugs could ever recreate." Morrison took what he learned
> from the relationship between 5th dimensional entities and us (3rd
> dimensional entities), and applied it to his work in comics. "I
> thought I could just interact with the 2nd dimension the way they
> relate to the 3rd dimension."
>
> Naturally, Morrison fielded questions concerning his being popularly
> characterized in some circles as a "rock star, drug-taking comics
> writer." He revealed that the reputation is somewhat dubious, as he
> was always very straightedge and didn't start experimenting with
> hallucinogens until he was 32, which for those keeping score puts his
> controversial "Doom Patrol" run in the drug-free zone. As for "The
> Invisibles," "Yeah, that was drugs," Morrison said. "All day, every
> day."
>
> A question was asked about the rejected Superman proposals Morrison
> pitched to DC five years ago. Morrison's glad he didn't get the job,
> saying "the ideas I've got now are so much better," and that none of
> those old concepts will find a home in "All-Star Superman" -- save
> one. Years ago at Comic-Con International in San Diego, Morrison was
> sitting at a hotel bar with then-current, now-former DC editor Dan
> Raspler, talking about Superman at 1:00 in the morning. The two were
> deep in thought and discussion when suddenly, in a moment of personal
> deus ex machina, Superman himself quite literally strolled by.
>
> Morrison accosted the man (presumably a convention goer in a Superman
> costume) and asked him to join he and Raspler at the bar. The Man of
> Steel cheerfully obliged and took his seat as any confident,
> successful and well-to-do gentlemen would, only with a bright cape
> draped casually across his arm. "That's when I GOT Superman!" Morrison
> exclaimed before detailing that his much publicized take on the
> character as a calm and cool dude is inspired primarily by that
> "shamanic experience" in San Diego, which is directly reflected in
> Frank Quitely's breathtaking cover illustration for "All-Star
> Superman" \#1.
>
> "What do you think of Batman?" Morrison asked Superman, beginning an
> interview that was to last over an hour and a half.
>
> "He only sees the darkness in the world," Superman answered. "I just
> don't get it."
>
> Of course, this is Grant Morrison, and this was Comic-Con, and if
> you're Grant Morrison and you have a Superman experience like that
> you're absolutely bound to have a Bizarro encounter as well, which
> Morrison did at a Comic-Con just a few years later. While paling
> around at a Ralph's grocery store with fellow Brit comics pro and
> noted Bizarro fan Chris Weston ("The Filth," "Ministry of Space"),
> Morrison turned around and found himself staring in the face of
> Superman's tragic clone. Once again, the comic pros engaged the man
> (again, presumably a convention-goer in costume and makeup) in
> conversation, but this time with far less desirable results.
>
> "We couldn't get rid of him!" Morrison sighed. "How do we get rid of
> this guy? He's really creeping us out!"
>
> Bizarro followed Weston and Morrison all around the Ralph's. Then all
> around the convention floor. And then finally to the hotel bar, where
> he used his Biazarro powers to solicit free drinks from the duo.
> Fortunately, they discovered his weakness, and when the drinks stopped
> coming, Bizarro went skulking into the night.
>
> The crowd eventually steered the discussion to Morrison's past work in
> the Marvel Universe, which he characterized as very gritty and
> pedestrian, "with so many rules and limitations... it's all based in
> the streets of New York City. I just didn't feel comfortable in the
> Marvel Universe." He defended his controversial "New X-Men" run as
> about, among other things, the next generation of man and ordinary
> people's reactions to them. Morrison also noted that while other
> X-scribes have employed the X-Men as a means to discuss issues of race
> and homosexuality, his run was about what he finds to be a growing
> hatred of children and the adult world's apparent mission to stifle
> children's ability to express themselves. He also touched on the
> internal politics of his lauded "Marvel Boy" series, which, according
> to Morrison, then-publisher Bill Jemas refused to allow to develop to
> its full cosmic potential. "[Jemas] couldn't wrap his head around it,"
> Morrison said. "Jemas wanted Marvel Boy based in a steel town, 'fixing
> things up good!'"
>
> As for future projects, Morrison delighted his audience with news that
> his long-awaited novel is finished and in the hands of his agent.
> "He's the same guy who sold the DaVinci Code," said Morrison.
> "Hopefully he'll work his magic on this one." And speaking of magic,
> the similarly long-awaited book "Pop Magic" is nearly done. A
> comprehensive guide to magic from the physical realm to the highest
> levels of mysticism, "Pop Magic" will be divided into three sections:
> Morrison's personal experiences; a how-to section for beginners; and a
> final section on magic theory.
>
> Before the night was over, Morrison, at the urging of his girlfriend,
> told a very unusual and, we must warn you, extremely disgusting story.
> Quite recently, a gold crown broke out of Morrison's mouth while he
> was eating. He accidentally swallowed the crown, which wouldn't have
> been such a big deal were it not for the outrageous cost of
> replacement: $1600. In a truly remarkable display of thriftiness, the
> writer spent the next several days digging through his own waste with
> a spoon trying to find that gold crown, even developing new systems to
> increase efficiency along the way. "I was shitting in a bag!" Morrison
> laughed. "But before I'd discovered the technology, I was shitting in
> the sink!"
>
> Tragically, the crown was never recovered. When asked if he would have
> put such a thing back into his mouth even if he had found it, Morrison
> replied, "That's the real question, isn't it? It's like Sophie's
> Choice."
>
> The final question of the night came from one genuinely heroic fan:
> "In the inevitable kaos war between you and Alan Moore, who do you
> think's gonna come out on top?"
>
> "It's not like that," Morrison sighed, reluctant to once again fuel
> the fire of gossip that's followed both writers for much of the last
> decade or so. "But," the writer added. "I've been practicing since
> 1978 and [Moore's] only been practicing since 1994. Who do you think?"
