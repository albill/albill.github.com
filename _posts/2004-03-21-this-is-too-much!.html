A friend of mine said this is like asking Michael Jackson if little boys are cute... <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=598&e=1&u=/nm/20040320/film_nm/mideast_passion_arafat_dc">http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=598&e=1&u=/nm/20040320/film_nm/mideast_passion_arafat_dc</a> <b>Yasser Arafat Says Gibson Film Not Anti-Semitic</b> RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat (<a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22Yasser%0AArafat%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw">news</a> - <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=yasser+arafat">web sites</a>) watched Mel Gibsons's controversial "Passion of the Christ" at a private screening on Saturday and said it was not anti-Semitic, officials said. He watched the film -- which Jewish groups say may foment anti-Semitic attacks -- with Palestinian Muslim and Christian leaders at his headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah. "The president did not feel the film was anti-Semitic," said Hanan Ashrawi, a prominent Palestinian Christian who watched it with him on a DVD copy. Arafat's advisor Nabil Abu Rdainah told the official Palestinian news agency WAFA the 74-year-old former guerrilla leader had hailed the film as "moving and historical." Jewish groups say Gibson's epic of the last 12 hours of Jesus's life could foment anti-Semitism with its graphic depiction of the torture and crucifixion of Jesus. German church leaders have also said its "overly negative portrayal" of Jews risked stoking anti-Semitic prejudice.
