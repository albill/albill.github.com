Rudy Rucker, one of my favorite science fiction freaks, has his "Transrealist Manifesto" online at <a href="http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/rucker/transrealistmanifesto.pdf">http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/rucker/transrealistmanifesto.pdf</a>.

Some will note that he also has a non-science fiction out as well in the last year.
