The enemy in this instance is the Greek ferry system and the boats. We
were going to take a speed boat to Mykonos this morning and then one of
the local boats to Delos. Two problems: there is no boat, not even a
slow ferry, back to Paros today from Mykonos (tomorrow is different, of
course). We paid for two nights in our room here...we decided to eat it
and just spend tonight in Mykonos when we found the other wrinkle. There
is only one boat to Delos a day right now from Mykonos. It leaves the
same time as our boat from Paros. So, even if we went to Mykonos, we
wouldn't get to go to Delos. I'm pretty disappointed because I really
wanted to go to Delos but there isn't much to do. We checked out of our
room early (and assured the flustered desk man that it was ok that he
couldn't give us our money back for tonight). We're catching a ferry to
Santirini within the hour. We figure that we've exhausted Paros and its
charms. It is a nice little island and the village is fairly interesting
but there isn't much to see and much going on. We figure we'd rather go
to Santirini a day early and either spend another day there (or Crete!)
than stay on Paros another day. We slept about ten hours last night and
we both feel a lot more normal today. I had the joy of a cold shower
(water comes in two temperatures: bone-nmbing cold and not-as-cold) and
we found good food. While the local version of an Americano bites, we've
had good luck ordering cuppacinos so we are sticking with those. I'm
sure we'll have a lot to see on Santirini. We did realize before we left
that our guidebook for Greece was missing most of the 30 pages on
Santirini so we have no idea how we're getting to the hotel from the
port or going around. ;-) More later...
