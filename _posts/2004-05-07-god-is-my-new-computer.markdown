Yesterday, I built a new desktop machine for home after doing some work
with AMD64 boxes here at work.

I purchased:

-   An Antec Sonata Case and Power supply (super quiet):

-   an AMD Athlon 64 3000+ CPU:

-   A gigabyte of PC3200 400 DDR RAM
-   A Western Digital Caviar 250 GB Serial ATA Hard Drive:

Into this system, I added my Radeon 9600 128 MB video card and my DVD
burner.

It took a little while to get all of the little bits into the system.
When I bought the CPU, I had them put it and the RAM on the motherboard
to avoid expensive "oops" issues (CPU seating can be tricky and they
aren't tolerant of failure). I also had to use another machine to get
SATA drivers onto a floppy and then connect the floppy from my old
machine temporarily because Windows XP needs to load the SATA drivers
from a floppy because they weren't standard technology a couple of years
ago.

After that, I installed Windows XP gold. It took *12 minutes*. Compare
this to the normal 45 minutes or an hour it normally takes. I then
installed the SP1 bits that I had on CD so my system would be patched.
That is a CD's worth of material to upgrade the OS and that took *8
minutes*. This thing smokes. Between the uberprocessor, the RAM, and the
freakin' fast hard drive, this thing just moves. I am in geek heaven.

What else has gone on this week? Hmm... not a lot overall outside of
work. I've been continuing to work through Neal Stephenson's
**Quicksilver** but am only about 1/3 of the way through the book. This
weekend, I'll be going to a friend's big 40th birthday celebration in
Downtown Seattle. I'll also be going out to Bainbridge Island to see
Garchen Rinpoche
([http://www.garchen.com/teachers.html](http://www.garchen.com/teachers.html))
present some teachings. Garchen Rinpoche is a rather highly regarded
figure who was imprisoned for 20 years, starting in the Chinese Cultural
Revolution. I've been told more than once by a number of people that I
should go see him.
