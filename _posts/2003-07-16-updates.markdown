Tonight, R and I will be going to Ted and Brandy's second class on
energy work. Fairly normal and basic stuff but it is good to go over
these things again and the pair of them are fairly accomplished. I know
that I always learn something new, which is nice. Why did the Romans
make their language so hard? I've just learned participles in the last
week and now we're working with gerundives and the absolute ablative.
Mr. Wheelock, I would keel-haul you if you weren't already in your
grave! Last night I did the Latin class thing. Monday night was my one
chance to actually read a little and relax a bit. On Sunday, R and I
rented **Gangs of New York**, which we'd both been waiting to see. I was
quite pleased with it even if it is a long movie and has Leonado di
Crapio in it. I enjoyed it and found it very interesting and colorful.
As with , it makes me want to read more about the period. Caleb Carr's
novels did the same for me as well. Why do I get the feeling that
America of the past, while having the utter squalor of a third world
country, was much more colorful and interesting of a place than the
McAmerica of today?
