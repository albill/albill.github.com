Tonight, R and I will be going to Ted and Brandy's second class on energy work. Fairly normal and basic stuff but it is good to go over these things again and the pair of them are fairly accomplished. I know that I always learn something new, which is nice.

Why did the Romans make their language so hard? I&apos;ve just learned participles in the last week and now we&apos;re working with gerundives and the absolute ablative. Mr. Wheelock, I would keel-haul you if you weren&apos;t already in your grave!

Last night I did the Latin class thing. Monday night was my one chance to actually read a little and relax a bit. 

On Sunday, R and I rented <b>Gangs of New York</b>, which we&apos;d both been waiting to see. I was quite pleased with it even if it is a long movie and has Leonado di Crapio in it. I enjoyed it and found it very interesting and colorful. As with <lj user="m7o7n7k">, it makes me want to read more about the period. Caleb Carr&apos;s novels did the same for me as well. 

Why do I get the feeling that America of the past, while having the utter squalor of a third world country, was much more colorful and interesting of a place than the McAmerica of today?
