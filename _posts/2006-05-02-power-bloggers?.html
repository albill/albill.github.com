We got to chat about blogging within the borg a bit and had a good time. Here is a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/korbyp/archive/2006/03/05/544111.aspx">link</a> to a blog post with a photo of us.... Now that I'm leaving the company, Betsy is taking over the 950+ person internal e-mail list I run at Microsoft on blogging. Good luck!!
