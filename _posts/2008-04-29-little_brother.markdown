I've been waiting to read [Cory Doctorow's](http://www.craphound.com)
new book, **[Little
Brother](http://www.amazon.com/Little-Brother-Cory-Doctorow/dp/0765319853)**,
since I first heard him talk about it. He did a reading from it last
year at **[SF in SF](http://www.sfinsf.org/)**, a local Science Fiction
salon (who are unable to provide an RSS feed for events...). The
official description of the book is:

> Marcus, a.k.a “w1n5t0n,” is only seventeen years old, but he figures
> he already knows how the system works–and how to work the system.
> Smart, fast, and wise to the ways of the networked world, he has no
> trouble outwitting his high school’s intrusive but clumsy surveillance
> systems. But his whole world changes when he and his friends find
> themselves caught in the aftermath of a major terrorist attack on San
> Francisco. In the wrong place at the wrong time, Marcus and his crew
> are apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security and whisked
> away to a secret prison where they’re mercilessly interrogated for
> days. When the DHS finally releases them, Marcus discovers that his
> city has become a police state where every citizen is treated like a
> potential terrorist. He knows that no one will believe his story,
> which leaves him only one option: to take down the DHS himself.

The afterword is written by security guru [Bruce
Schneier](http://www.schneier.com/blog/). How cool is that? Today is the
official release day and, right on time, my Amazon pre-order slapped
into my porch from my local mail dwarf. Check it out:

I put in a gratuitous pro-Tor picture of my personal laptop as well.
([Tor](http://tor.eff.org) plays a role in the book, as I recall.) I
recorded Cory's reading last year, which is embedded below, if you are
interested in hearing the excerpt from the book. There is a bit of an
introduction from the SF in SF organizers and Cory starts at about 4
minutes and 55 seconds into the recording. [display\_podcast]
