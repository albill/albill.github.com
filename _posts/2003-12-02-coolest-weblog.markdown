I'm reading a lot of weblogs via RSS feeds from them that go into my Outlook install at work. There is a free Outlook RSS aggregator.

One of the best is <strong>Another World is Here</strong> which is at <a href="http://www.worldchanging.org">http://www.worldchanging.org</a>.<lj user="worldchanging"></lj>

They have all sorts of interesting topics.
