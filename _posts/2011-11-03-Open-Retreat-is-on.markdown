The details for the upcoming two day open retreat in the East Bay of California have been updated and somewhat finalized. I am still looking for three or four teachers to cover the morning and afternoon talks/practicums/teachings on each day. Even if they can only come for that time period or that half of the day, it would be great to get some local, Bay Area, teachers to come out and teach.

The organizational site for this event is <a href="http://bayarea.opensangha.org">bayarea.opensangha.org</a>. I plan on additional quarterly open retreats and, probably, a monthly day-long sit on a weekend day.

You can RSVP on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Open-Sangha/events/38578392/">meetup.com</a> if you're local and want to attend.

I include the details below.
<hr>
<p>This is a open retreat, unaffiliated with any specific organization or tradition of practice. This is occurring on November 19 and 20, 2011.</p>
<p>This is a 2 day, community organized non-residential retreat. This retreat will be a collaboration of practitioners from the varied Buddhist traditions and will consist of periods of sitting and walking meditation, group discussion, and recorded Dharma talks from known and respected teachers. We are also seeking a local teacher who might wish to share live teachings, in person.</p>
<p>This retreat will be primarily facilitated by Al Jigen Billings, but will ultimately be community directed, according to the needs of the present participants. We hope that each person will bring something to add to the altar, and an intention or aspiration to share with the group for these two days of shared practice. This retreat will be suitable for students of all levels of experience, and we welcome people from all traditions. However, only basic instruction will be offered, so please contact us ahead of time to find out if this retreat is right for you.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule</strong></p>
<p>The daily schedule will look something like the following, with the caveat that this is a more "Zen" version and the actual schedule may be more diverse than this:</p>
<ul>
<li>9:00 - Open morning some kind of fairly open liturgical practice (this may be impractical though)</li>
<li>9:30 - 11:10 Alternate sitting and walking meditation for two sessions each (40 minute sit, 10 minute walking)</li>
<li>11:15 - 12:30 - Some kind of morning talk or practicum</li>
<li>12:30 - 1:30 - Lunch</li>
<li>1:30 - 3:10 - Alternate sitting and walking meditation for two sessions each (40 minute sit, 10 minute walking)</li>
<li>3:20 - 5:00 - Afternoon talk or practicum</li>
<li>5:10 - 6:50 Alternate sitting and walking meditation for two sessions each (40 minute sit, 10 minute walking)</li>
<li>7:00 - Dedication of merit and closing</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is to alternate periods of meditation that occur for most of two hours with other practices or talks.</p>
<p>We would love to see meditation methods, such as Vipassana techniques, explained and led for any of the larger block meditation sessions by other community members.</p>
<p>This should not be a "top down" style of event but one with just a couple of facilitators. We can do what the people who arrive want to do with a schedule planned ahead of time, loosely, to frame things if people do not feel an urge to diverge.</p>
