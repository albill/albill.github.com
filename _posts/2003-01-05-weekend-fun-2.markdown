I'm reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/189035001X/"><em>In the Dark Places of Wisdom</em></a> by Kingsley and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385498721/"><em>Survivor</em></a> by Palahniuk (author of <em>Fight Club</em>) this weekend. There's a double-feature for you. This may qualify as Kingsley's "nut job" book but it is interesting.

I did finish the recent <em>21st Century Mage</em> book on the Abramelin operation this week. It was "ok" but a bit overly lightweight. On a plus note, I found Tester's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0851152554/"><em>A History of Western Astrology</em></a> which seems to be quite a solid history text and not simply a foo-foo astology book. I found a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0877287104/"><em>Tibetan Buddhist Medicine and Psychiatry</em></a> as well.

R and I spent the day futzing about the house and had a nice walk down the road to the local coffeehouse and such. On the way back, we rented <em>The Talented Mr. Ripley</em> (which she hadn't seen) and an MST3K DVD of <em>The Crawling Hand.</em> It made for an enjoyable evening inn. We've been working our way through the Dune miniseries off and on in preparation for the next one in a couple of months.

I start Latin on Tuesday. Yee haw. I'm going to be forced to kill someone probably if I wind up going to grad school and am forced to learn Tibetan or Sanskrit instead. A strong argument can be made for not being able to really go wrong learning Latin though.

I'm still thinking of taking a martial arts class. The two schools that I looked at recently only offer classes at the same time as my Latin class so that isn't very helpful. I haven't dug out the Silat class yet and looked at their schedule. Picking a martial art is liking picking a dance style or something. So many choices and by the time you know what the right one is, you're already neck deep in a class. ;-)

R has reserved our room for <a href="http://www.notocon.org">Notocon</a> though and I bought our tickets last week. We got a room with a sitting room attached so we can have people up to our room or maybe a party while we're there.
