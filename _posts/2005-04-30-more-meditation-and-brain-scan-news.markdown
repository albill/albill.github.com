<h2>Scans of Monks' Brains Show Meditation Alters Structure, Functioning</h2>
<h2><i>November&nbsp;5,&nbsp;2004;&nbsp;Page&nbsp;B1</i>, Wall Street Journal</h2>
<h2>&nbsp;By SHARON BEGLEY</h2>
<p>All of the Dalai Lama's guests peered intently at the brain scan projected 
onto screens at either end of the room, but what different guests they were.</p>
<p>On one side sat five neuroscientists, united in their belief that physical 
processes in the brain can explain all the wonders of the mind, without appeal 
to anything spiritual or nonphysical.</p>
<p>Facing them sat dozens of Tibetan Buddhist monks in burgundy-and-saffron 
robes, convinced that one round-faced young man in their midst is the 
reincarnation of one of the Dalai Lama's late teachers, that another is the 
reincarnation of a 12th-century monk, and that the entity we call &quot;mind&quot; is not, 
as neuroscience says, just a manifestation of the brain.</p>
<p>It was not, in other words, your typical science meeting.</p>
<p>But although the Buddhists and scientists who met for five days last month in 
the Dalai Lama's home in Dharamsala, India, had different views on the little 
matters of reincarnation and the relationship of mind to brain, they set them 
aside in the interest of a shared goal. They had come together in the shadows of 
the Himalayas to discuss one of the hottest topics in brain science: 
neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>The term refers to the brain's recently discovered ability to change its 
structure and function, in particular by expanding or strengthening circuits 
that are used and by shrinking or weakening those that are rarely engaged. In 
its short history, the science of neuroplasticity has mostly documented brain 
changes that reflect physical experience and input from the outside world. In 
pianists who play many arpeggios, for instance, brain regions that control the 
index finger and middle finger become fused, apparently because when one finger 
hits a key in one of these fast-tempo movements, the other does so almost 
simultaneously, fooling the brain into thinking the two fingers are one. As a 
result of the fused brain regions, the pianist can no longer move those fingers 
independently of one another.</p>
<p>Lately, however, scientists have begun to wonder whether the brain can change 
in response to purely internal, mental signals. That's where the Buddhists come 
in. Their centuries-old tradition of meditation offers a real-life experiment in 
the power of those will-o'-the-wisps, thoughts, to alter the physical matter of 
the brain.</p>
<p>&quot;Of all the concepts in modern neuroscience, it is neuroplasticity that has 
the greatest potential for meaningful interaction with Buddhism,&quot; says 
neuroscientist Richard Davidson of the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The 
Dalai Lama agreed, and he encouraged monks to donate (temporarily) their brains 
to science.</p>
<p>The result was the scans that Prof. Davidson projected in Dharamsala. They 
compared brain activity in volunteers who were novice meditators to that of 
Buddhist monks who had spent more than 10,000 hours in meditation. The task was 
to practice &quot;compassion&quot; meditation, generating a feeling of loving kindness 
toward all beings.</p>
<p>&quot;We tried to generate a mental state in which compassion permeates the whole 
mind with no other thoughts,&quot; says Matthieu Ricard, a Buddhist monk at Shechen 
Monastery in Katmandu, Nepal, who holds a Ph.D. in genetics.</p>
<p>In a striking difference between novices and monks, the latter showed a 
dramatic increase in high-frequency brain activity called gamma waves during 
compassion meditation. Thought to be the signature of neuronal activity that 
knits together far-flung brain circuits, gamma waves underlie higher mental 
activity such as consciousness. The novice meditators &quot;showed a slight increase 
in gamma activity, but most monks showed extremely large increases of a sort 
that has never been reported before in the neuroscience literature,&quot; says Prof. 
Davidson, suggesting that mental training can bring the brain to a greater level 
of consciousness.</p>
<p>Using the brain scan called functional magnetic resonance imaging, the 
scientists pinpointed regions that were active during compassion meditation. In 
almost every case, the enhanced activity was greater in the monks' brains than 
the novices'. Activity in the left prefrontal cortex (the seat of positive 
emotions such as happiness) swamped activity in the right prefrontal (site of 
negative emotions and anxiety), something never before seen from purely mental 
activity. A sprawling circuit that switches on at the sight of suffering also 
showed greater activity in the monks. So did regions responsible for planned 
movement, as if the monks' brains were itching to go to the aid of those in 
distress.</p>
<p>&quot;It feels like a total readiness to act, to help,&quot; recalled Mr. Ricard.</p>
<p>The study will be published next week in Proceedings of the National Academy 
of Sciences. &quot;We can't rule out the possibility that there was a pre-existing 
difference in brain function between monks and novices,&quot; says Prof. Davidson, 
&quot;but the fact that monks with the most hours of meditation showed the greatest 
brain changes gives us confidence that the changes are actually produced by 
mental training.&quot;</p>
<p>That opens up the tantalizing possibility that the brain, like the rest of 
the body, can be altered intentionally. Just as aerobics sculpt the muscles, so 
mental training sculpts the gray matter in ways scientists are only beginning to 
fathom.</p>
