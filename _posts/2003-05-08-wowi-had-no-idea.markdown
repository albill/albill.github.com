**THE BUSINESS PLOT TO OVERTHROW ROOSEVELT** In the summer of 1933,
shortly after Roosevelt's "First 100 Days," America's richest
businessmen were in a panic. It was clear that Roosevelt intended to
conduct a massive redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor.
Roosevelt had to be stopped at all costs. The answer was a military
coup. It was to be secretly financed and organized by leading officers
of the Morgan and Du Pont empires. This included some of America's
richest and most famous names of the time:

-   **Irenee Du Pont** - Right-wing chemical industrialist and founder
    of the American Liberty League, the organization assigned to execute
    the plot.
-   **Grayson Murphy** - Director of Goodyear, Bethlehem Steel and a
    group of J.P. Morgan banks.
-   **William Doyle** - Former state commander of the American Legion
    and a central plotter of the coup.
-   **John Davis** - Former Democratic presidential candidate and a
    senior attorney for J.P. Morgan.
-   **Al Smith** - Roosevelt's bitter political foe from New York. Smith
    was a former governor of New York and a codirector of the American
    Liberty League.
-   **John J. Raskob** - A high-ranking Du Pont officer and a former
    chairman of the Democratic Party. In later decades, Raskob would
    become a "Knight of Malta," a Roman Catholic Religious Order with a
    high percentage of CIA spies, including CIA Directors William Casey,
    William Colby and John McCone.
-   **Robert Clark** - One of Wall Street's richest bankers and
    stockbrokers.
-   **Gerald MacGuire** - Bond salesman for Clark, and a former
    commander of the Connecticut American Legion. MacGuire was the key
    recruiter to General Butler.

The plotters attempted to recruit General Smedley Butler to lead the
coup. They selected him because he was a war hero who was popular with
the troops. The plotters felt his good reputation was important to make
the troops feel confident that they were doing the right thing by
overthrowing a democratically elected president. However, this was a
mistake: Butler was popular with the troops because he identified with
them. That is, he was a man of the people, not the elite. When the
plotters approached General Butler with their proposal to lead the coup,
he pretended to go along with the plan at first, secretly deciding to
betray it to Congress at the right moment. What the businessmen proposed
was dramatic: they wanted General Butler to deliver an ultimatum to
Roosevelt. Roosevelt would pretend to become sick and incapacitated from
his polio, and allow a newly created cabinet officer, a "Secretary of
General Affairs," to run things in his stead. The secretary, of course,
would be carrying out the orders of Wall Street. If Roosevelt refused,
then General Butler would force him out with an army of 500,000 war
veterans from the American Legion. But MacGuire assured Butler the cover
story would work:

The businessmen also promised that money was no object: Clark told
Butler that he would spend half his $60 million fortune to save the
other half. And what type of government would replace Roosevelt's New
Deal? MacGuire was perfectly candid to Paul French, a reporter friend of
General Butler's:

Indeed, it turns out that MacGuire travelled to Italy to study
Mussolini's fascist state, and came away mightily impressed. He wrote
glowing reports back to his boss, Robert Clark, suggesting that they
implement the same thing. If this sounds too fantastic to believe, we
should remember that by 1933, the crimes of fascism were still mostly in
the future, and its dangers were largely unknown, even to its
supporters. But in the early days, many businessmen openly admired
Mussolini because he had used a strong hand to deal with labor unions,
put out social unrest, and get the economy working again, if only at the
point of a gun. Americans today would be appalled to learn of the many
famous millionaires back then who initially admired Hitler and
Mussolini: Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller, John and Allen Dulles (who,
besides being millionaires, would later become Eisenhower's Secretary of
State and CIA Director, respectively), and, of course, everyone on the
above list. They disavowed Hitler and Mussolini only after their
atrocities grew to indefensible levels. The plot fell apart when Butler
went public. The general revealed the details of the coup before the
McCormack-Dickstein Committee, which would later become the notorious
House Un-American Activities Committee. (In the 50s, this committee
would destroy the lives of hundreds of innocent Americans with its
communist witch hunts.) The Committee heard the testimony of Butler and
French, but failed to call in any of the coup plotters for questioning,
other than MacGuire. In fact, the Committee whitewashed the public
version of its final report, deleting the names of powerful businessmen
whose reputations they sought to protect. The most likely reason for
this response is that Wall Street had undue influence in Congress also.
Even more alarming, the elite-controlled media failed to pick up on the
story, and even today the incident remains little known. The elite
managed to spin the story as nothing more than the rumors and hearsay of
Butler and French, even though Butler was a Quaker of unimpeachable
honesty and integrity. Butler, appalled by the cover-up, went on
national radio to denounce it, but with little success. Butler was not
vindicated until 1967, when journalist John Spivak uncovered the
Committee's internal, secret report. It clearly confirmed Butler's
story:

Needless to say, the survival of America's democracy is not an automatic
or sure thing. Americans need to remain vigilant against *all*
enemies... both foreign and domestic. Sources: Jonathon Vankin and John
