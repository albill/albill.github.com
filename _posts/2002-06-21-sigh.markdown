Burning all of your music to MP3 is so fucking time-consuming. I feel like I'm nailed to this chair as a human cd switcher sometimes. ;-)

It would probably be better if I hadn't done this once before. Most of my music was in WMA format. I know some people hate that but since I work for Microsoft and will, it looks like, spend the next two years or so working on music stuff there, that doesn't bother me. Unfortunately, most of the stereo component and car digital music players (and my DVD player) only handle MP3 so I'm switching everything over, which means clean burns. I have found CDs that I've missed though.

It's a looooong process and I have to hand type a bunch of my industrial crap. Why the hell do the programs automatically know who Razor Skyline or Waiting for God are but I have to tell them what the latest VNV Nation album is?
