Sunday

Several readers of my blog have spoken at a couple of points about
seeing me. This is your chance to speak up and work something out if
you're around. Aron, Dana, Catherine, and Sean have all said something
about getting together. Let's talk in e-mail or comments if you're
interested. Off to bed.
