Is this what it is like to get older?

You watch your friends begin to die. Some get sick. Some have accidents. Some are murdered. I think I begin to understand my grandmother more, who always pointed out places where she had worked with people in hospice and mentioned that she had "helped someone die there."

As most know, my father is dying as well though it may be a year or more in coming and could possibly be averted.

I liked Chris a lot. I only really got to know him through a few visits and the times we hung out at the Karen's Rites of Eleusis but he was a great guy. I got to hear parts of his story that he wanted to tell and it was inspiring to hear him do so. I'll miss the chance to talk to him again.
