This article is the scariest thing that I'ved read in weeks:
[http://www.harpers.org/JesusPlusNothing.html?pg=1](http://www.harpers.org/JesusPlusNothing.html?pg=1)

Now, I have nothing particular against Christians. One of my uncles is a
minister and another used to be one until fairly recently. They are good
men, by and large, even if we disagree on things. I grew up Catholic and
lived in a Protestant household through high school and college. (Of
course, the main thing this did was give me a love of ritual and a
desire not to be a Christian but that's another story.)

Reading about this behind the scenes, let's-control-the-world-for-Christ
stuff is scary though. Who is out there checking these people other than
a couple of reporters?

What's even better is that this group started in my home town in
response to all of the traditional radicalism in Seattle and Washinton
state back in the early part of the 20th century.

I'm reminded of one of the things that Bruce Sterling said recently that
you need a counter-network to stop a network. That's from the Netwars
book from the RAND institute that I'm reading right now.

An interview with the fellow that did the article is here:
