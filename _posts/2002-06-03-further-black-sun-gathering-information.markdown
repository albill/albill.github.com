This is the updated information that I received last night in e-mail for the Black Sun Gathering.

<font size="+1"><b>The Black Sun Gathering</b></font>

<b>What is it?:</b> The Black Sun gathering is a Dark Arts Festival. The intent is to bring together the weird, beautiful, dramatic and unusual elements of life and culture to a location of natural habitat. To bring forth a sense of communion with the elements and a general state of freedom to express our art and share it with those who will appreciate it.

<b>When is it?</b>   Summer Solstice, beginning June 21st (friday) and ending the morning of June 24th (monday) of 2002.

<b>History:</b>  The Black Sun Gathering is put on by Dark Star productions and has gone under various titles for each of the Solstice and Equinox occurrences. In the past they have taken place in the northern parts of Washington, on a smaller scale. Recently it has come to our attention that many are interested in becoming a part of our events... and so we are growing and becoming more accessible to the populace.

Our Prior gatherings were weekend campouts. Each night there was performance, music and ritual performance.
