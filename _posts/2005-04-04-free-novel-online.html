<p>Richard Kadrey, who has written some good stories in the past, has released 
the full text of his new urban fantasy novel in a nice PDF. I&#39;m not sure of the 
backstory on why it was not published but why look a gift horse in the mouth. He 
says in his letter:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Dear Everyone,</p>
	<p>Back around 9/11, when I saw such disparate fantasies as <strong>
	Hellblazer</strong> and <strong>Preacher</strong>, <strong>American Gods</strong> 
	and <strong>Carrie</strong>, <strong>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</strong> and
	<strong>Donnie Darko</strong> living together in happy harmony in friends&#39; 
	homes, I thought it would be a swell idea to write a little fantasy novel in 
	a modern American prose style. </p>
	<p>Damn, was I wrong.</p>
	<p>A series of misadventures, misunderstandings and missteps later, I have 
	an orphan book on my hands. Rather than let the gnarled little thing sulk in 
	the corner, getting fat on pilfered cat food and dust bunnies, I&#39;ve decided 
	to send it out into the world to seek its own good times or oblivion. Toward 
	that end, I&#39;m putting the entire text of the novel online as a free, 
	downloadable PDF. It&#39;s in a lovely package designed by type-god
	<a href="http://www.creativepro.com/author/home/951.html">John D. Berry</a>.</p>
	<p>The book is titled <b>Blind Shrike</b>. It&#39;s not a rotten book, I think. 
	In fact, it&#39;s a pretty traditional fantasy quest, just one that, to me, 
	makes sense in George W. Bush&#39;s America. The hero of the story is on a quest 
	for his own lost ignorance and innocence. He really doesn&#39;t want to know too 
	much because, as many of us have learned, too much information is a 
	soul-sucking pain in the ass. In the book you&#39;ll also find magic and 
	monsters, angels and demons, magical swords and forbidden books. And blimps. 
	Every fantasy novel should have at least one blimp.</p>
	<p>So, with a last blurt of carnival barking, I now give you <b>Blind Shrike</b>. 
	You might like it or you might hate it. I hope that you download it and 
	enjoy it. But if you don&#39;t, tough. It&#39;s free. Don&#39;t write me any stupid 
	emails. Instead, go write your own damned book. </p>
	<p>Love &amp; kisses,</p>
	<p>Richard Kadrey</p>
