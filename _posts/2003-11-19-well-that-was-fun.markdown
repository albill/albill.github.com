R and I went to couples counseling tonight. No, we&apos;re not about to break up (at least to my knowledge...). This is part of "Oh, we&apos;re going to get married and we argue a lot so we should do this" thing. She insisted and I agreed because it makes good sense in general.

I&apos;m not sure I like the counselor that we&apos;re working with. Some ol&apos; biddy who would probably run screaming from the room if I mentioned Crowley or weird sex.

In any case, here is my summary of issues from the first session as it seems to me:<ul><li>I&apos;m an argumentative bastard</li><li>I&apos;m an argumentative bastard</li><li>I&apos;m an argumentative bastard</li><li>I&apos;m an argumentative bastard</li><li><b>I&apos;m an argumentative bastard</b></li></ul>I think that summarizes it fairly well.

I think I&apos;ll do a fucking root canal next.
