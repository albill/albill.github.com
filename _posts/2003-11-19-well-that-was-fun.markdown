R and I went to couples counseling tonight. No, we're not about to break
up (at least to my knowledge...). This is part of "Oh, we're going to
get married and we argue a lot so we should do this" thing. She insisted
and I agreed because it makes good sense in general. I'm not sure I like
the counselor that we're working with. Some ol' biddy who would probably
run screaming from the room if I mentioned Crowley or weird sex. In any
case, here is my summary of issues from the first session as it seems to
me:

-   I'm an argumentative bastard
-   I'm an argumentative bastard
-   I'm an argumentative bastard
-   I'm an argumentative bastard
-   **I'm an argumentative bastard**

I think that summarizes it fairly well. I think I'll do a fucking root
canal next.
