My new computer equipment was delivered to me at work today. Since it is easier to put computers together while surrounded by other computers (for debugging, etc), I stayed late to work on it.

Four hours and a trip to CompUSA later, I have determined that either my new motherboard or my new CPU is fried. I am pretty sure it is the motherboard because the symptom is that I turn on the power, the power runs for a quarter or half second (fans cycle up and lights flash on) and then it all turns off. If it was the CPU, it would try to do a system check and then complain or beep like crazy or something similar.

I thought it was a bad power supply so I got another one at the store (something might have been shorting out and power supply problems are common). Same behavior. I unplugged everything but the RAM and the CPU so I know it is a basic issue.

Tomorrow I get to call Newegg and see about a new motherboard. I'm pretty fried now from beating my head against this (and assembling things with tiny screws in my large hands).

Sometimes it doesn't pay to be a geek.
