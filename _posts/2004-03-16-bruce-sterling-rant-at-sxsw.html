<p>Impressionistic Transcript by Cory Doctorow

<p>--</p>
<p>I'm having a party tonight and you're all invited to my house for free beer.</p>
<p>Yes yes yes.</p>
<p>We've got WiFi!</p>
<p>We've got vodka!</p>
<p>We've got 100% free electrical wall plugs</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>My next book is a technothriller called Zenith Angle, near future -- it's an 
sf novel, but not set in the future. Gibson's doing this too. It's a trend among 
aging cyberpunks. It's not cyberpunk, it's not steampunk, it's NOWpunk.</p>
<p>You've gotta be tired, weary and grey to set your sf in the present day. but 
at least we're still in the ditch, still shipping product. It makes me proud, 
especially when I see what these kids with their anime and RPGs are up to.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I've got a daily blog now. I get weird mail from Pakistani guys telling me 
that I'm wrong about the Pakistani nuke program: My cousin built that bomb! 
We're no threat to the world! We can't even make needles.</p>
<p>This is a genius administration for inspiring angry rhetoric. It's got a 
nice, interesting consistency. I like Rumsfeld, I dig his poetry. Job one in the 
Bush Admin is to get it spun: they're an info-war-centric outfit. If you get it 
spun, you don't need to get it done.</p><lj-cut text="read the rest...">
<p>Controlling the message is more important to them than controlling the 
underlying reality. It's a blatant part of their ideology. Their global climate 
change policy is in defiance of the laws of physics, it's Lysenkoism. The Union 
of Concerned Scientists has a page documenting the Bushies' Lysenkoism from 
climate change to on. </p>
<p>The science stuff is starting to blow back. The UCS is nonpartisan. It's like 
Stalin and Lysenko's faith-based agriculture: the reason Soviet wheat fields 
have weeds is because wheat is evolving into weeds. You didn't have to get the 
peasants to weed the fields, you could just allege this. Scientists were amazed 
and horrified. Soviet scientists who went abroad to talk about chemistry and 
physics were confronted with a credibility gap arising from this -- they had to 
admit that back home, politicians made up the laws of physics. So scientists 
defected to Cornell.</p>
<p>19,000 Euros died of the heatwave, and Beltway insiders are claiming that 
there's no climate change.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Austin has declared itself the clean energy capital of the world. I want 
that. I'll suffer a lot for that advantage. I won't defect to Denmark as long as 
Austin is trying to make itself into the clean energy capital of the world. I 
got 1-2 kW of photovoltaics on my roof. I'll go 20kW and power my neighborhood 
and blanket it in WiFi with South African surplus microwave horns. It's 
grassroots: it's right on my roof.</p>
<p>Every country with oil collapses: Venezuela, Iran, Iraq, Canada -- Norway's 
the sole exception.</p>
<p>Creative class people -- the people at this event -- will never prosper in an 
oil society. An oil society sinks a well and surrounds it with bayonets and 
waits for the civil society to decline around it. Why bother, so long as there's 
money coming out of the ground?</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>2003 was the year for India. The best year in 2000 years. There 
are amazing improvements in everyday Indian living standards: 
plumbing, infrastructure, health: they're abolishing 
elephantiasis! You couldn't live in India without seeing people 
whose bodies were destroyed by this affliction. Now they've got 
it's number, it'll be gone in 50 years.</p><p>It's popular to freak out over Indian offshoring, but that's 
shortsighted. If you really want 1BB people to remain ignorant 
and backward forever, why not embrace it at home? Were we more 
prosperous during the century when the American South was 
backwards and ignorant?</p><p>Indians are opposed to this, too! There's a spinning wheel on the 
Indian flag -- Ghandi's wheel, with which he made his own clothes 
to frustrate multinational English clothes corporations. Not only 
was he relentlessly against offshoring, but in order to effect 
change, he spun his own fibres. Always! He was always making his 
own clothes with his own hands all the damn time: he made that 
simple cruddy loincloth with his own hands.</p><p>But the new ruling party has opened up engineering schools to see 
if they could compete and they can! They're doin' OK!</p><p>Not only that, they're creative! Bollywood lost a lot of money 
because they'd been making the same movie for 50 years. New 
Bollywood gets offshore financing is net in NYC, everyone in it 
is an outsourced Indian living in the USA in the hood, and it's a 
hit domestically and overseas.</p><p>Go to sulekha.com -- a website for Indian diasapora people -- 
it's international, it's got guides to every city in the US, all 
used by local Indians. Or bazee.com, where you can buy the 
clothing off the backs of Bollywood actresses and have it FedExed 
to your house, and the US$ is strong against the Rupee, even if 
it's tanking on the Euro. They're making a lot of money: it's the 
Bollywood version of collectible plastic figurines.</p><p>Globalization isn't Americanization: it's everybody's ization: 
Chinese, Indian, you name it. Every little town in the US has a 
couple of Chinese restaurants, an India town and Japanese 
popculture. It's not about the Washington consensus anymore.</p><p>It used to be that globalization came out of the US State 
Department's lib-democracy stuff, but with the militarization of 
the State Dept, it's more like Brazilification. Gilberto Gil is a 
popstar, 60s acid-head and the culture minister: the weirdest 
politician in the world right now.</p><p>I wish I'd kept up a list with red pins of everywhere this guy 
has been since the govt took power in Brazil. He's touring. it's 
uncanny how much road-time he's logging. he's performing as a 
musician and being the Minister of Culture and doing culture 
deals: he's into Open Source Software! He wants to preside over 
the tropicalization of digitization.</p><p>What do 3d world people want from the Internet? They outnumber 
the advanced world by a huge margin. What's their killer app? 
It's not going to be given to them by MSFT: there's not immediate 
return on investment there. Bill might cure elephantiasis, but 
MSFT can't commercially offer Internet access to desperately poor 
people, but that doesn't mean it can't be done.</p><p>It can be done in weird ways with goys on WiFi bicycles in 
Cambodia soaking up email and pedalling off.</p><p>It's alarming to have Brazil as the world's most politically 
innovative country. Even Brazilians like to say that Brazil is 
country of the future and always will be. They've got a lot of 
things wrong.</p><p>--</p><p>I'm not into the military and I'm not an anti-war guy. I'm more 
into infosec. I wrote Hacker Crackdown in 1990 -- it was one of 
the few computer crime books that talked to computer cops. I'm 
sincerely interested in it. Cops are a fact of life. WIthout 
cops, you get riots. I spend a lot of time thinking about 
infosec.</p><p>The 4 years of the Bush administration trying to secure the 
Internet has been a debacle: it's getting worse and worse. Just 
look at the virii and the phishing, the torrents of porn, 
pharmaceutical fraud, rank quakery, privacy invasion: hordes of 
spooks TIAing around, and the civlib people playing hack-a-mole 
with the Poindexters and they just go underground and rename 
their programs.</p><p>Thousands of people have had their PCs turned into spam zombies. 
A third of your spam comes from innocent people who can't secure 
their MSFT machine because it's impossible to do so! Outlook is a 
flaw with a mailer attach to it. It's phony-baloney 
embrace-and-extend engineering, devil take the hindmost, and the 
hindmost is everybody. The Internet is choking on this stuff.</p><p>I remember cops telling me in 1990 that there is no good security 
on the Internet and that malefactors were less naive than the 
techies who weren't streetwise, they needed the shelter of cops, 
and nothing will happen until there's a major-league security 
disaster. I thought, well, they're trying to feather their own 
nests, it's alarmism. But it's worked out more or less as my 
informants told me. It's real real bad on the Internet now.</p><p>We don't notice in America cos we've had the net for so long -- 
we're a boiled frog, we don't notice the torrent of filth, but if 
you could email it to yourself 10 years ago, it would shock the 
shit out of you. Today, someone in China is plugging a computer 
in and facing the worst filth in the world. If you could get 
every scam artist, phisher, and 419 scammer and surround this 
building, we'd see them as a terrifying army, but they have carte 
blanche to go anywhere in the world and terrorize people less 
sophisticated than ourselves.</p><p>This is supposed to be one of the orchids of American culture, 
but imagine someone from a sheltered, shy society, where 
marriages last and most people earn their living growing food, 
opening up a browser and seeing what we brought on ourselves and 
on other people!</p><p>It's appalling. The Bushies had an opportunity to fix this thing. 
Go look at Clarke's and Schmidt's whitepapers on this: make 
companies responsible for their vulnerabilities, get MSFT to back 
off, it's all commonsense. But no one is paying attention, and 
it's not getting better. They have no intention of fixing things: 
they're incompetent. If they were hardcases who gave us law and 
order, kept people from being victimized, they'd be a tough 
right-wing government, but they're not, the gov't for all its 
tough-talk chatter won't even listen to the advice they got from 
their own hand-picked experts on the subject. Fixing this 
involves investing political capital, it's hard, it's global, 
it's security, it's diplomacy and freedom of speech, and they're 
not tackling any of it. It's a crying shame and a scandal. I'm 
close to it and it makes me indignant.</p><p>They don't do things in public. They lie and they're into 
super-secret stuff. When they get caught, they're embarrassed. I 
met a UN inspector, a Marine named Scott Ridder, at a convention. 
He got up and said in public, the WMDs, there aren't any. They're 
incompetent: they think they've got them, but they can't make 
them, they can't get it together. They can sell oil, but they're 
militarily incompetent. There are no WMDs. All the stuff about 
nukes and sarin and bio-agents, it's a put-up job. It's bullshit.</p><p>I haven't heard a word out of Scott Ridder in ages. Our jaws were 
dropping and we were shocked.</p><p>The administration is living a lie, like an alcoholic in denial. 
You can't say anything to them, the reaction is, "You bastard!"</p><p>--</p><p>The Spanish PM lost his job for bullshitting, for spinning the 
train attack as Basques when it was obviously Al Quaeda. In Spain 
they're tired of bullshit. They followed the PM to the poll and 
booed him: Put down that ballot, you lying son of a bitch. They 
were sick of the deceit. It wasn't the war, it was the policy of 
spin and feeding lies. It's the dismal business.</p><p>--</p><p>Coming up: Martin Rees, a UK scientist thinks that the chances of 
our civilization surviving the 21st century are 50-50. I've met 
him, he's got his facts straight.</p><p>I'm cheered up by that! 50-50! Those are great damned odds. This 
year was the 50th anniversary of the Bikini Atoll test, since the 
crust-busting bomb was invented, and we haven't blown ourselves 
up. We're up to 50-50! And my personal chances of making it to 
2100 are 99.995 against. I'll spend the rest of my life watching 
people work on this thing and die without knowing if they pull it 
off. It's exciting, a fantastic spectacle. If it were guaranteed, 
life would be just a little dull.</p><p>We've got the power to save ourselves or screw ourselves up.</p><p>--</p><p>What'm I watching? Microbial threats to health: SARS and bird 
flu. They're spooky.</p><p>These bugs mostly kill old people, and this century is the most 
old-people-top-heavy society everywhere. Old people are all over 
Italy, Japan, everywhere. It's a demographic thing.</p><p>The only things that change population are birth and death and 
immigration rates and catastrophe. With bad SARS or bird flu we 
might get s disease that makes 30-year-olds sneeze for a couple 
days and kill off hundreds of millions of people in their 70s. 
19000 people died of heat in Europe: almost all old people. 
They're metabolically vulnerable, they don't sweat well.</p><p>I'm looking at lot at global red-light districts. Globalization 
doesn't lift all boats, it can create criminal states, 
mafia-dominated, and non-competitive. They spend all their time 
exporting criminal services: trafficking in humans, drugs, money 
laundering. They only difference between them and an oil state is 
that oil states have oil -- and if it runs out they go straight 
into this.</p><p>It used to be that this was self-correcting, you'd get a 
strong-man after 2 years or so. But Somalia has been a failed 
state for 14 years. They're all online, but they're still a 
criminal state. It's ecommerce criminality, but they're not going 
to industrialize. They won't get shoe factories, but they will 
grow khat.</p><p>You chew these broomstraws, and purple foam comes out and then 
you drive your tactical around shooting at strangers. It's too 
hard to ship, so it's not in the US, but that problem will be 
corrected soon. They'll figure out how to fix it online and sell 
it via Viagra ads.</p><p>What else to they have? Their whole country is a favela, a 
red-light district. This is the real war on terror. It's the real 
problem of globalization: failed states fester and prey upon the 
successes. We could invade Somalia, but we tried it and it didn't 
work. It's a challenge in global governance for our generation 
and our childrens' generation. I dunno if its UN constabulary or 
a new feudalism with high walls.</p><p>The trouble moves in first now and the narcotics follow.</p><p>--</p><p>I'm watching NGOs, standards-setting boards, global civil society 
orgs. If there's a new world order it will come out of these 
bodies.</p><p>I watch sustainability -- the 20th Century isn't do-able. We need 
to work on this. Austin's a good city to watch people try to 
solve things. Austin's a happy place, and imperiled, but doing 
the right thing. I take comfort in Havel's statement about hope: 
"This isn't a facile expectation that things will turn out well, 
but the conviction that what you're doing makes sense no matter 
how things turn out." And that's what Austin is up to.</p><p>I'm off to sign some books -- come over to my place and drink 
some beer!</p><p>eof</p>
