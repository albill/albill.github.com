I've put the [third podcast](http://www.extemplo.org/?p=6) for [**Ex
Templo**](http://www.extemplo.org) up on its site. This is the second of
the three parts of my interview with Jiun Sensei, my Buddhist teacher
and the abbot of [Daiun-Ji Great Cloud Temple](http://www.daiun-ji.org)
in Ohio. I wound up staying up half the night working on this because in
the next to the last step of creating the source mp3 file, I lost the
first five seconds of the podcast. I just switched to a new Apple
computer a couple of days ago so I had to change from using Soundforge
for the audio work to using
[Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/), an open source program.
Unfortunately, about every third time I ever use audacity, something bad
happens... In this instance, it seems that audacity really **does not
like** cutting and pasting between open projects. I was adding the intro
and it reacted badly to the inserting. Internally, it seems to store the
files in 2.5 second pieces in a data directory and it lost the first two
pieces. I had to go find my source audio (which I had spent an hour or
two cleaning up for the file that was damaged) and recover the missing
section. The merge wasn't as seamless as I would like but it will do. I
know that some people use Apple's Garageband software for podcast
editing but I've never worked with it. By default, it only likes to save
in its native format and Apple's AAC format. I upload my podcasts to the
Internet Archive as 256kbps files and then have it downsample
automatically from their using lame. I prefer to make the nicer format
files available for those that wish to download them at maximum quality.
If anyone has any suggestion for podcasting and sound tools on a Mac
Pro, please let me know. I'm not sure if I'm going to use audacity again
after this.
