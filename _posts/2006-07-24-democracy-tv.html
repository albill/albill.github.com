I downloaded the Democracy Player last night from <a href="http://www.getdemocracy.com/">http://www.getdemocracy.com/</a>. They have a version available for OS X as of this last week.

It is an open source project to create an avenue for the democratization of visual media in the form of TV. It uses the bittorrent protocol to transfer the video files around. All of their code is available and they have guides to getting your own content up into the channel guide.

There is some cool stuff up already and I subscribed to a few things. I finally started watching the <a href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/make_podcast/">video podcasts</a> from Make, for example. We'll see where this goes but it is some cool stuff.
