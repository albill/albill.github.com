I just found out that the Math Store about eight blocks away from me (just down the street) has a web site. <a href="http://www.math-n-stuff.com/">http://www.math-n-stuff.com/</a>. I&apos;ve never been in there because their hours have often been limited.

So, I look at their site and found out that, yes, indeed, they have sets of Platonic Solids ("Geometric Solids") for $9.99. As people may recall, I bought a set of large dice, sanded them, filled the lines and painted them to make my set that I haven&apos;t been happy with.

I know what I&apos;m buying this weekend...
