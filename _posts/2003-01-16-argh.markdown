I just found out that the Math Store about eight blocks away from me
(just down the street) has a web site.
[http://www.math-n-stuff.com/](http://www.math-n-stuff.com/). I've never
been in there because their hours have often been limited. So, I look at
their site and found out that, yes, indeed, they have sets of Platonic
Solids ("Geometric Solids") for $9.99. As people may recall, I bought a
set of large dice, sanded them, filled the lines and painted them to
make my set that I haven't been happy with. I know what I'm buying this
weekend...
