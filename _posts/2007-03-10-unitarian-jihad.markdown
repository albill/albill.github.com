It is time once again to remind people of the Unitarian Jihad.

As <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/04/08/DDG27BCFLG1.DTL">Jon Carroll wrote</a> a couple of years ago:
<blockquote>"Greetings to the Imprisoned Citizens of the United States. We are  Unitarian Jihad. There is only God, unless there is more than one God. The  vote of our God subcommittee is 10-8 in favor of one God, with two abstentions. Brother Flaming Sword of Moderation noted the possibility of there being no  God at all, and his objection was noted with love by the secretary.

"Greetings to the Imprisoned Citizens of the United States! Too long has  your attention been waylaid by the bright baubles of extremist thought. Too  long have fundamentalist yahoos of all religions (except Buddhism  --  14-5  vote, no abstentions, fundamentalism subcommittee) made your head hurt. Too  long have you been buffeted by angry people who think that God talks to them.  You have a right to your moderation! You have the power to be calm! We will  use the IED of truth to explode the SUV of dogmatic expression!

"People of the United States, why is everyone yelling at you??? Whatever  happened to ... you know, everything? Why is the news dominated by nutballs  saying that the Ten Commandments have to be tattooed inside the eyelids of  every American, or that Allah has told them to kill Americans in order to rid  the world of Satan, or that Yahweh has instructed them to go live wherever  they feel like, or that Shiva thinks bombing mosques is a great idea? Sister  Immaculate Dagger of Peace notes for the record that we mean no disrespect to  Jews, Muslims, Christians or Hindus. Referred back to the committee of the  whole for further discussion."</blockquote>
This impassioned plea for, well, a little less passion and sincerity and a little more reflection, has struck a chord with many. For those so inclined, you can receive your name within the Unitarian Jihad <a href="http://www.elsewhere.org/cgi-bin/jihad">online</a>.
