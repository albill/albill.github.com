I'm going to <a href="http://www.pantheacon.org">PantheaCon</a> this coming weekend from Friday the 13th through Monday the 16th. This is a longstanding (more than a decade) pagan convention. I attended in 2002 and had a great experience. My mother is going to be presenting her presentation on the Egyptian goddess, Nuit, that she did at <a href="http://www.notocon.org">NotoCon</a> (the Ordo Templi Orientis convention) this year that she also came to Seattle to present to the <a href="http://www.speakeasy.org/~bwilliam/sps.html">Seattle Pagan Scholars</a>. Since I've seen it twice already, I'm not required to attend.
