I'm going to [PantheaCon](http://www.pantheacon.org) this coming weekend
from Friday the 13th through Monday the 16th. This is a longstanding
(more than a decade) pagan convention. I attended in 2002 and had a
great experience. My mother is going to be presenting her presentation
on the Egyptian goddess, Nuit, that she did at
[NotoCon](http://www.notocon.org) (the Ordo Templi Orientis convention)
this year that she also came to Seattle to present to the [Seattle Pagan
Scholars](http://www.speakeasy.org/~bwilliam/sps.html). Since I've seen
it twice already, I'm not required to attend.
