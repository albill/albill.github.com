I was not paying attention to the net or media today while I did that
"have a life" thing with my wife. I just found out about the execution
of everyone's pal, Saddam. While I agree that he did anything and
everything that could be done to deserve death without getting his hands
personally dirty, I find the whole thing barbaric, especially the
ghoulish attention paid to the images and even cellphone recorded
footage of his hanging. How we act towards our enemies, especially in
victory, says a lot about our nation. I don't care that we're playing
"let's pretend" and that the Iraqis technically executed him. This was
orchestrated by us. This is not a defense of Saddam Hussein. He was as
evil of a dictator as there was in the 20th century and a perpetrated
genocide. That doesn't mean that things had to work out this way.
