Robert Aitken Roshi died last night. He was 93 years old. This is a sad
moment for American Zen. Here is the [official
notice](http://robertaitken.blogspot.com/2010/08/goodbye-dad-grandfather-papa-friend.html)
from his blog. James Ford wrote a [wonderful
post](http://www.shambhalasun.com/sunspace/?p=17949) on Aitken Roshi
reflecting on his history and impact. Aitken Roshi, through his books
and example, has had a profound effect on my perception of Zen and my
desire to practice this path. He has been one of the stalwart examples
of an ethical teacher that, as far a I can tell, lived up to the
principles of our faith. His writings were and are incredibly
inspirational to me. I believe he will be remembered as one of our most
important Western teachers of the 20th and early 21st centuries. [Jack

posted the following quote from Aitken Roshi's book, “Miniatures of a
Zen Master”:

> "Old age ain’t no place for sissies. Yes, that’s true. One must cope
> with a range of afflictions from incontinence to macular degeneration,
> not to mention peripheral neuropathy, strokes and cancer – and memory
> loss! Yet I don’t mourn my loss youth. What a confused mess I was!
> What time I wasted! All in all, I am really quite comfortable in these
> last years. Pass the marmalade."
