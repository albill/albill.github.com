James Ford wrote a <a href="http://www.shambhalasun.com/sunspace/?p=17949">wonderful post</a> on Aitken Roshi reflecting on his history and impact. Aitken Roshi, through his books and example, has had a profound effect on my perception of Zen and my desire to practice this path. He has been one of the stalwart examples of an ethical teacher that, as far a I can tell, lived up to the principles of our faith. His writings were and are incredibly inspirational to me. I believe he will be remembered as one of our most important Western teachers of the 20th and early 21st centuries. <a href="http://zendirtzendust.com/2010/08/06/aitken-roshi-passes-away-at-93-pass-the-marmalade/">Jack Daw</a> posted the following quote from Aitken Roshi's book, “Miniatures of a Zen Master”: <blockquote>

Yes, that’s true. One must cope with a range of afflictions from incontinence to macular degeneration, not to mention peripheral neuropathy, strokes and cancer – and memory loss! Yet I don’t mourn my loss youth. What a confused mess I was! What time I wasted! All in all, I am really quite comfortable in these last years. Pass the marmalade."
