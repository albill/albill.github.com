For anyone that wants to find the Defcon 16 CD of presentations, it is
on [popular bittorrent
sites](http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4347389/DEFCON16_2008.rar) but
can also be downloaded
[here](http://www.i-hacked.com/freefiles/defcon16.iso) as well. Most of
the talks are pretty close to what was presented. A number of presenters
did update talks at the last minute (and said so) but I haven't seen a
central clearing house for finding the updated talks. Google Video has
various short videos on Defcon 16
[available](http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=defcon+16) and I would
expect more to show up over time since presentations from Defcon 15 [can
be found
there](http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=defcon+16#q=defcon%2015) as
well. I also noticed that
[TechWebTV](http://ca.youtube.com/user/TechWebTV) has short interviews
and bits from Black Hat 2008 online. An
[interview](http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=2lGKzHYBXtQ) with the fellows
from "Satan is on my Friends List" is one example.

On a related note, the [25th Chaos Communications
Congress](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/wiki/Main_Page) has put up
its [Call for Participation](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/) for
the event this December finally. The named theme this year is "Nothing
to Hide." This event takes place from December 27 through the 30 in
Berlin and I expect that I will be going to it still.
