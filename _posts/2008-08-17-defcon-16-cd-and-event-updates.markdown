For anyone that wants to find the Defcon 16 CD of presentations, it is on <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4347389/DEFCON16_2008.rar">popular bittorrent sites</a> but can also be downloaded <a href="http://www.i-hacked.com/freefiles/defcon16.iso">here</a> as well.

Most of the talks are pretty close to what was presented. A number of presenters did update talks at the last minute (and said so) but I haven't seen a central clearing house for finding the updated talks.

Google Video has various short videos on Defcon 16 <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=defcon+16">available</a> and I would expect more to show up over time since presentations from Defcon 15 <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=defcon+16#q=defcon 15">can be found there</a> as well.

I also noticed that <a href="http://ca.youtube.com/user/TechWebTV">TechWebTV</a> has short interviews and bits from Black Hat 2008 online. An <a href="http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=2lGKzHYBXtQ">interview</a> with the fellows from "Satan is on my Friends List" is one example.

On a related note, the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/wiki/Main_Page">25th Chaos Communications Congress</a> has put up its <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/">Call for Participation</a> for the event this December finally. The named theme this year is "Nothing to Hide." This event takes place from December 27 through the 30 in Berlin and I expect that I will be going to it still.
