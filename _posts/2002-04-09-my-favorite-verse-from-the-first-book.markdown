Today is the first day of the unveiling of the Book of the Law. This is
my favorite verse of the first book:

> 61. But to love me is better than all things: if under the night stars
> in the desert thou presently burnest mine incense before me, invoking
> me with a pure heart, and the Serpent flame therein, thou shalt come a
> little to lie in my bosom. For one kiss wilt thou then be willing to
> give all; but whoso gives one particle of dust shall lose all in that
> hour. Ye shall gather goods and store of women and spices; ye shall
> wear rich jewels; ye shall exceed the nations of the earth in spendour
> & pride; but always in the love of me, and so shall ye come to my joy.
> I charge you earnestly to come before me in a single robe, and covered
> with a rich headdress. I love you! I yearn to you! Pale or purple,
> veiled or voluptuous, I who am all pleasure and purple, and
> drunkenness of the innermost sense, desire you. Put on the wings, and
> arouse the coiled splendour within you: come unto me!
