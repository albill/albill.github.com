Hopefully, you've already heard about this. If not, read the [LA
Times](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-taser18nov18,0,4080498.story?coll=la-home-headlines)
here and [Blake
Ross](http://www.blakeross.com/2006/11/17/on-the-ucla-tasering/) writing
on this. This makes me actively sick. Leaving aside cops tasering
someone for no good reason, refusing to provide identification to
onlookers and then threatening onlookers, I'm utterly shocked that
people just stood around like sheep and watched it happen. A couple of
generations ago, bricks and bats would have been found and people would
have taken steps to stop such an obvious abuse of power. I am against
violence but I am also against people just standing by and watching
college cops taser someone repeatedly as they yell at him to "stand up!"
The video below is from someone's phonecam.
