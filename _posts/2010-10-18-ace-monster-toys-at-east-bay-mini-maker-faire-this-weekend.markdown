[Ace Monster Toys](http://www.acemonstertoys.org/display/AMT/Home), the
East Bay hackerspace, is going to have a booth at the [East Bay Mini
Maker Faire](http://ebmakerfaire.wordpress.com/) taking place in Oakland
this coming weekend. This is the first local event we will be attending
since our founding back in June and our acquisition of a space at the
end of July. The plan right now is to have three or four
[makerbots](http://www.makerbot.com/) acting as a little makerbot
orchestra, to have one or two of them printing objects (especially if I
can get the plastruder on mine working), and to have a laminar flow
water fountain. It's nice to see an event like the mini maker faire
going on right in our neck of the woods and we're looking forward to
seeing who else shows up from the local community. It is a good
opportunity to make connections with local groups and individuals,
especially the kids at the Park Day school.

By the way, as you can see above, we finally have a cool logo. [David
Rorex](http://blog.davr.org/), our treasurer, has a friend who is an
excellent designer. Rebecca Hathaway made the logo that you see above
and below, as well as some variants, and got them to us just the other
day. I'm not sure if we'll have them on our flyers, given the timing,
but I'm super excited about how it turned out. You can see an examples
of variants below, incorporating the letters "AMT" as well as a robot in
the inverse space:

The word also came down today that Ace Monster Toys has been approved as
a California nonprofit corporation. The next step is our filing for
Federal 501(c)(3) status. This, at least, means that we can finally get
all of our business, such as a bank account, in the name of the
organization. We have entered corporate personhood!
