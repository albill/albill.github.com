I'm going to start generating keys and switching my communication
options to include encrypted mail via my public key. I'll be putting
them up on Arcanology.com and posting the key here when I do so. At that
point, you should feel free to e-mail me using this key. I'll post
software suggestions for people on how to easily do this using Mozilla
Thunderbird and free, open source tools. If it is something innocuous
like "Did you feed the cat?", I don't care if it is in the clear but I
want to move to meaningful e-mail done via encryption. This is obviously
a pain in the ass and a lot of trouble. Why would I take this step? The
answer is that the surveillance state on the Internet in America is
likely becoming a permanent feature. I don't really like the idea of
some federal agent in Homeland Security reading my e-mail either. I'm a
citizen and have never been convicted of any crimes. This is not how a
free society should be run. Here is the news story of the day around
this from Threat Level:
