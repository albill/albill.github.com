<img width="174" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="236" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.cmc.net/~amrita/chagdud.jpg" />The head of the Tibetan Buddhist group that I've felt the most affinity for, <a href="http://www.chagdud.org/">Chagdud Rinpoche</a>, has died in the last 24 hours...

I was supposed to meet him on the big retreat this fall but he wasn't feeling well and his son came out instead. I just read his autobiography in the last few months and while his group was traditional in ways that didn't necessarily synch well with me, it was an embracing group and I felt the most home as I've felt anywhere with its local branch. I expect I will continue to do so. He was a man that I've only ever heard good things about as a lama. He was willing to buck convention and ordain women and westerners to be lineage holders and I haven't a negative thought about he or his people. I was hoping to meet him after reading his autobiography and I was looking forward to more teachings from him.
