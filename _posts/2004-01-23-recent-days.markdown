I haven't written much of detail recently.

Work has been security patch hell with a lot of concurrent work going on to get some deliverables out on time. I've had to do a bunch of test planning and people management stuff and have had many many meetings every day. Busy times.

I did get away for a while to go see a presentation by Microsoft Research, which is the company's privately funded R&D group for eggheads. If you thought my co-workers were geeky, you should check out these guys. The presenter I watched today was almost embarrasing to watch in a <strong>Revenge of the Nerds</strong> sort of way (complete with nerd laugh). The presentation was <strong>Quantum Computing: A Topological Approach</strong> and the fellow is a PhD math geek working on this space and publishing papers. The presentation was a precursor to ones being done at the MSR annual "Techfest" in March. The math stuff was a bit hard to follow but I got the gist of most things and it was pretty cool compared to writing a test plan. :-)

Right now, in my reading, I'm wading my way through Gene Wolfe's various "Sun" books. I'm re-reading (for the first time since I was a teen) the original Books of the New Sun. I'll follow this with <strong>The Urth of the New Sun</strong>, then the four Long Sun books and finally the three Short Sun books. This ought to keep me busy for a little while.

R and I are happily waiting to go to PantheaCon and it looks like we'll be children at the local Gnostic Mass in February. I've never done it before so it is a bit new.
