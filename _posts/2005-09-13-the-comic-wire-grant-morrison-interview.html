<p><strong>GRANT MORRISON TALKS WITH FANS AT MELTDOWN HOLLYWOOD</strong> <br /> 	<em>by <a href="mailto:andy@comicbookresources.com">Andy Khouri</a>,  	Contributing Writer</em> <br /> 	Posted: April 1, 2005 </p><p>	A very unique gathering of assorted humans occurred Thursday night in  	Hollywood, California. Approximately one-hundred or so hipsters, hippies,  	geeks, bikers, punks, nerds, burnouts, freaks, mutants, celebrities and  	terribly normals affected a cease fire in the brutal pop culture wars of the  	second millennium and communed peacefully in the long box rows of 	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.meltcomics.com/">Meltdown Comics</a> to  	hear what master comics writer and practicing magician 	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.grant-morrison.com/">Grant Morrison</a>  	had to say.  </p><p>Morrison's eclectic flock of fans -- many of whom might possibly never be  	caught dead in even the same men's room together -- included fellow comics  	scribe Joe Casey (&quot;Wildcats,&quot; &quot;The Intimates&quot;), Hollywood producer Don  	Murphy (&quot;LXG,&quot; &quot;From Hell&quot;) and UK pop star Robbie Williams. Naturally, CBR  	News was on hand to steal souls (snap pics) and record the evening's  	highlights for our readers. </p> 	<p>Co-presenting the event with Meltdown was national counterculture  	periodical <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arthurmag.com/">Arthur</a>,  	with editor Jay Babcock bravely wrangling the mass of dissidents and  	moderating the Q&amp;A. </p> 	<p>As one might expect, much of the discussion centered on what is sure to  	be the writer's most mainstream exposure to date, &quot;All-Star Superman,&quot;  	Morrison's forthcoming twelve issue DC Comics series with frequent  	collaborator Frank Quitely. </p> 	<p>Characterizing the sixty year old American icon as a God and kind of  	solar consciousness, Morrison simultaneously lamented the loss of Superman's  	&quot;human connection,&quot; citing with great praise the work of legendary DC Comics  	editor Mort Weisinger, whose personal issues Morrison felt were overtly  	reflected in the pages of the books Weisinger edited. Morrison enthralled  	his freakish audience with synopsis of a number of Weisinger classics (or at  	least, now-classics), including an amazing story in which Superman found  	himself with a new power that while fantastic, afflicted him with a terrible  	exhaustion. Morrison explained how the plot had you guessing until finally  	revealing that the Man of Steel's new power was to produce a tiny little  	Superman from his palm who would fly up into the sky and rescue failing  	aircraft. &quot;This new power has rendered me useless!&quot; Morrison said of  	Superman's thoughts on the matter. &quot;Nobody loves me anymore, they just love  	my SUPER-IMP!&quot; </p> 	<p>&quot;Take that, Sigmund!&quot; Morrison laughed. </p> 	<p>Of course, the lines between solar consciousness, super-imps and magic  	are decidedly thin, and as such, the discussion often returned throughout  	the evening to Morrison's long association with the occult. A practicing  	magician since 1978, Morrison was heavily influenced by an uncle. &quot;A man so  	committed to magic,&quot; Morrison explained, &quot;he believed if you couldn't grow  	back a severed arm, you weren't really a magician!&quot; </p> 	<p>Morrison then proceeded to regale the crowd with his now legendary  	contact experience in the hills of Katmandu: that while lying in bed, he was  	visited by shiny silver anti-bodies from the 5th dimension, an experience he  	described as &quot;being electrocuted by god,&quot; and something that &quot;no drugs could  	ever recreate.&quot; Morrison took what he learned from the relationship between  	5th dimensional entities and us (3rd dimensional entities), and applied it  	to his work in comics. &quot;I thought I could just interact with the 2nd  	dimension the way they relate to the 3rd dimension.&quot; </p> 	<p>Naturally, Morrison fielded questions concerning his being popularly  	characterized in some circles as a &quot;rock star, drug-taking comics writer.&quot;  	He revealed that the reputation is somewhat dubious, as he was always very  	straightedge and didn't start experimenting with hallucinogens until he was  	32, which for those keeping score puts his controversial &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; run  	in the drug-free zone. As for &quot;The Invisibles,&quot; &quot;Yeah, that was drugs,&quot;  	Morrison said. &quot;All day, every day.&quot; </p> 	<p>A question was asked about the rejected Superman proposals Morrison  	pitched to DC five years ago. Morrison's glad he didn't get the job, saying  	&quot;the ideas I've got now are so much better,&quot; and that none of those old  	concepts will find a home in &quot;All-Star Superman&quot; -- save one. Years ago at  	Comic-Con International in San Diego, Morrison was sitting at a hotel bar  	with then-current, now-former DC editor Dan Raspler, talking about Superman  	at 1:00 in the morning. The two were deep in thought and discussion when  	suddenly, in a moment of personal deus ex machina, Superman himself quite  	literally strolled by. </p> 	<p>Morrison accosted the man (presumably a convention goer in a Superman  	costume) and asked him to join he and Raspler at the bar. The Man of Steel  	cheerfully obliged and took his seat as any confident, successful and  	well-to-do gentlemen would, only with a bright cape draped casually across  	his arm. &quot;That's when I GOT Superman!&quot; Morrison exclaimed before detailing  	that his much publicized take on the character as a calm and cool dude is  	inspired primarily by that &quot;shamanic experience&quot; in San Diego, which is  	directly reflected in Frank Quitely's breathtaking cover illustration for  	&quot;All-Star Superman&quot; #1. </p> 	<p>&quot;What do you think of Batman?&quot; Morrison asked Superman, beginning an  	interview that was to last over an hour and a half. </p> 	<p>&quot;He only sees the darkness in the world,&quot; Superman answered. &quot;I just  	don't get it.&quot; </p> 	<p>Of course, this is Grant Morrison, and this was Comic-Con, and if you're  	Grant Morrison and you have a Superman experience like that you're  	absolutely bound to have a Bizarro encounter as well, which Morrison did at  	a Comic-Con just a few years later. While paling around at a Ralph's grocery  	store with fellow Brit comics pro and noted Bizarro fan Chris Weston (&quot;The  	Filth,&quot; &quot;Ministry of Space&quot;), Morrison turned around and found himself  	staring in the face of Superman's tragic clone. Once again, the comic pros  	engaged the man (again, presumably a convention-goer in costume and makeup)  	in conversation, but this time with far less desirable results. </p> 	<p>&quot;We couldn't get rid of him!&quot; Morrison sighed. &quot;How do we get rid of this  	guy? He's really creeping us out!&quot; </p> 	<p>Bizarro followed Weston and Morrison all around the Ralph's. Then all  	around the convention floor. And then finally to the hotel bar, where he  	used his Biazarro powers to solicit free drinks from the duo. Fortunately,  	they discovered his weakness, and when the drinks stopped coming, Bizarro  	went skulking into the night. </p> 	<p>The crowd eventually steered the discussion to Morrison's past work in  	the Marvel Universe, which he characterized as very gritty and pedestrian,  	&quot;with so many rules and limitations... it's all based in the streets of New  	York City. I just didn't feel comfortable in the Marvel Universe.&quot; He  	defended his controversial &quot;New X-Men&quot; run as about, among other things, the  	next generation of man and ordinary people's reactions to them. Morrison  	also noted that while other X-scribes have employed the X-Men as a means to  	discuss issues of race and homosexuality, his run was about what he finds to  	be a growing hatred of children and the adult world's apparent mission to  	stifle children's ability to express themselves. He also touched on the  	internal politics of his lauded &quot;Marvel Boy&quot; series, which, according to  	Morrison, then-publisher Bill Jemas refused to allow to develop to its full  	cosmic potential. &quot;[Jemas] couldn't wrap his head around it,&quot; Morrison said.  	&quot;Jemas wanted Marvel Boy based in a steel town, 'fixing things up good!'&quot; 	</p> 	<p>As for future projects, Morrison delighted his audience with news that  	his long-awaited novel is finished and in the hands of his agent. &quot;He's the  	same guy who sold the DaVinci Code,&quot; said Morrison. &quot;Hopefully he'll work  	his magic on this one.&quot; And speaking of magic, the similarly long-awaited  	book &quot;Pop Magic&quot; is nearly done. A comprehensive guide to magic from the  	physical realm to the highest levels of mysticism, &quot;Pop Magic&quot; will be  	divided into three sections: Morrison's personal experiences; a how-to  	section for beginners; and a final section on magic theory. </p> 	<p>Before the night was over, Morrison, at the urging of his girlfriend,  	told a very unusual and, we must warn you, extremely disgusting story. Quite  	recently, a gold crown broke out of Morrison's mouth while he was eating. He  	accidentally swallowed the crown, which wouldn't have been such a big deal  	were it not for the outrageous cost of replacement: $1600. In a truly  	remarkable display of thriftiness, the writer spent the next several days  	digging through his own waste with a spoon trying to find that gold crown,  	even developing new systems to increase efficiency along the way. &quot;I was  	shitting in a bag!&quot; Morrison laughed. &quot;But before I'd discovered the  	technology, I was shitting in the sink!&quot; </p> 	<p>Tragically, the crown was never recovered. When asked if he would have  	put such a thing back into his mouth even if he had found it, Morrison  	replied, &quot;That's the real question, isn't it? It's like Sophie's Choice.&quot;</p> 	<p>The final question of the night came from one genuinely heroic fan: &quot;In  	the inevitable kaos war between you and Alan Moore, who do you think's gonna  	come out on top?&quot; </p> 	<p>&quot;It's not like that,&quot; Morrison sighed, reluctant to once again fuel the  	fire of gossip that's followed both writers for much of the last decade or  	so. &quot;But,&quot; the writer added. &quot;I've been practicing since 1978 and [Moore's]  	only been practicing since 1994. Who do you think?&quot; </p> 	<p><em>CBR Executive Producer Jonah Weiland contributed to this story</em> </p> </blockquote> <p><a href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=5044"> http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=5044</a> </p>
