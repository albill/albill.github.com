[Daniel Reetz](http://www.danreetz.com) has released his beta files for the newer [DIY Book Scanner](http://www.diybookscanner.org) that he showed at the Open Hardware Summit. This is the first version designed to be CNC milled directly and from a single standard sheet of plywood. Of course, to do so, you'd need a shopbot or similarly sized router. You can also do it with smaller pieces of plywood on a more commonly sized CNC though some of the pieces are fairly large. It should be noted that the plywood is sized to be about 3/4" in thickness, as it gets a bit wobbly otherwise in places.
 
Daniel has an [announcement](http://diybookscanner.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=1192) on the DIYbookscanner.org forums and a 16 minute long demonstration and walk through of the new version up on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4-qMc2QSOw), which I have embedded below:

Daniel links to the source files, offered under the [Open Hardware (OSHW 1.0)](http://freedomdefined.org/OSHW) license, in his [post](http://diybookscanner.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=1192) but I link to them directly here as well:

[Ace Monster Toys](http://www.acemonstertoys.org), as Daniel mentions in the video, has the wood parts for one of these. We have to get a few additional parts but I expect that we'll be building our new DIY book scanner in the next few weeks. I want to thank Daniel for all of his hard work here and for being a good friend to AMT.
