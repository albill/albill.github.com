Alright, so my title is a little inflamatory. I got in a fun near
flamewar on a local list within the last couple of weeks because I was
soliciting others to get together to protest any invasion of Iraq if it
occured. A friend has posted some links to various places online to add
to the efforts to lodge protests against such a war (for all of the good
it will do). I did find [this fun
site](http://www.hermes-press.com/brainwash1.htm) this evening. Heh. I
like the posters:
