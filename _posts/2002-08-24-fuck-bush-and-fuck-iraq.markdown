Alright, so my title is a little inflamatory. I got in a fun near flamewar on a local list within the last couple of weeks because I was soliciting others to get together to protest any invasion of Iraq if it occured.

A friend has posted some links to various places online to add to the efforts to lodge protests against such a war (for all of the good it will do).

I did find <a href="http://www.hermes-press.com/brainwash1.htm">this fun site</a> this evening. Heh. I like the posters:
