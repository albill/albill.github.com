Alright, so my title is a little inflamatory. I got in a fun near flamewar on a local list within the last couple of weeks because I was soliciting others to get together to protest any invasion of Iraq if it occured. A friend has posted some links to various places online to add to the efforts to lodge protests against such a war (for all of the good it will do). I did find <a href="http://www.hermes-press.com/brainwash1.htm">this fun site</a> this evening. Heh. I like the posters: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/1703303795/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2176/1703303795_8b6c7d9ece_o.gif" width="250" height="368" alt="backtheattack" /></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/1703303595/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2398/1703303595_efbfbe8de4_o.jpg" width="308" height="510" alt="silence" /></a>
