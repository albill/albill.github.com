I've uploaded the last part of my three part interview with [T. Thorn
Coyle](http://www.thorncoyle.com/) to the [Ex
Templo](http://www.extemplo.org) site. You can go directly to the entry
on the [Ex Templo Blog](http://www.extemplo.org/?p=12). [Father Jordan
Stratford](http://egina2.blogspot.com/) and I have been talking recently
and we'll be doing an interview in the near term. Father Stratford is a
Gnostic priest in the [Apostolic Johannite
Church](http://www.johannite.org/) in Victoria, British Columbia. There
is also a fair chance that I'll be able to interview a local activist
Roman Catholic priest that Thorn knows but I have to track the fellow
down and chat with him first so we'll see.
