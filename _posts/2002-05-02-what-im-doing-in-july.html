I'm going to attend a version of the Rites of Eleusis that happens in California every year. It turns out R has gone to this before and has spoken quite highly of it. I'll be gone for a bit over a week at it. I'm rather looking forward to this...

They have a <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Aegean/3193/">web site</a> which speaks a bit about the original rites and some about the event.
