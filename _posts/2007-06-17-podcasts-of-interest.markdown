I listen to quite a few podcasts while walking or driving in the car (I
have a connector for my iPod in the car). I wanted to give people a list
of some of my favorite podcasts.

-   [Buddhist Geeks](http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/)
    ([feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/BuddhistGeeksPodcast)) - This is
    a fairly recent podcast done by a trio of, well, Buddhist Geeks.
    They interview a variety of Buddhist teachers and are probably
    pretty closely aligned to a lot of my thought on Buddhism.
-   [12 Byzantine
    Rulers](http://www.anders.com/lectures/lars_brownworth/12_byzantine_rulers/)
    ([feed](http://www.anders.com/lectures/lars_brownworth/12_byzantine_rulers/rss.xml))
    - A phenomenal podcast on the history of the misnamed Byzantine
    Empire through 12 of its emperors. This is a fun podcast to listen
    to if you have any interest in history.
-   [alchemically braindamaged](http://uroboros.wordpress.com/)
    ([feed](http://zacharius.libsyn.com/rss)) - Zac's podcast on magic
    and spirituality. He's a Buddhist practitioner with a background in
    Western occult practices so a lot of what he says makes pretty solid
    sense to me. I don't agree with some of what he goes on about but it
    is an exceptionally interesting podcast. This has probably been,
    over time, my favorite podcast.
-   [Dan Carlin's Hardcore History](http://www.dancarlin.com/)
    ([feed](http://www.dancarlin.com/dchh.xml)) - This is an excellent
    podcast on history. I've been enjoying this a massive amount
    recently. Dan also has a podcast called "[Common
    Sense](http://www.dancarlin.com/cswdc.xml)", which I just subscribed
    to as well. I haven't listened to much of it yet though.
-   [Path of the Ekayana](http://daiun-ji.org/path)
    ([feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/daiun-ji/thzP)) - This is Rev.
    Jiun Foster's podcast. He's is the abbot of Daiun-Ji Great Cloud
    Temple, which is the organization that I am "attached" to and he's
    my primary Buddhist teacher. He's also all that ***and*** a bag of
    chips. The podcast is mostly audio from teachings given during group
    practice on Sundays and a few classes.
-   [Unfettered Mind](http://www.unfetteredmind.com/audio/) ([iTunes
    only
    feed](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=106320028))
    - This is [Ken McLeod](http://www.unfetteredmind.org/um/ken.php)'s
    audio of Buddhist retreats and classes that he teaches. Ken is a
    Vajrayana teacher in Los Angeles and I've gotten a lot of his
    Buddhist material. He recently started up "[Unfettered
    Questions](http://www.unfetteredmind.com/audio/podquest.php)" as a
    Q&A audio podcast as well.
-   [Cory Doctorow's Craphound.com](http://craphound.com/)
    ([feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/doctorow_podcast)) - Cory
    Doctorow is a well known science fiction writer (he won a Locus
    award yesterday for the third year in a row). He's also a technology
    and privacy pundit who used to be an evangelist for the [Electronic
    Frontier Foundation](http://www.eff.org/). He uploads talks by him
    (including one that I recorded!) and readings of his stories.

Please check these out. If you have any suggestions of podcasts for me,
please feel free to leave me comments or e-mail me as well.
