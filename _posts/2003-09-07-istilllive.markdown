I&apos;m back. Shit, air travel really is the Greyhound of the Sky. I was stuck with a two year old directly behind me and over one seat and an infant in my row across the aisle... ;-)

I&apos;m in Seattle again. After my ritual work yesterday, we had a large gathering at the order head&apos;s home with chicken, wine, cheese, wine, cookies, wine, scotch, wine...you get the idea. Oh, there was some beer too. That being said, a number of us stayed up on the back deck until 3:30 AM or so chatting and drinking a little. I got up at 9:30, had some coffee and got dropped off at the airport (to discover my plane was delayed). 

The lack of sleep, weird eating habits (I didn&apos;t eat at all really yesterday until after the ritual work) and the travel seems to have done a number on my stomach. I&apos;m feeling pretty wiped as well.

I&apos;m off to work in the morning and then flying out Tuesday morning. I just checked my work e-mail and it turns out that my speaker phone turned itself on Friday evening and one of my employees was frantically trying to find a key to my office (I have a lock because I do hardware ordering for our test team). Eventually they got in and turned it off. Heh. How does  a speaker phone turn itself on 24 hours after I leave my locked office. That&apos;s a good one.

Anyway, I&apos;m off to rest a bit more...
