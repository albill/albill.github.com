I just saw [this
article](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article5217495.ece)
at the Times Online today. An excerpt is below:

This is pretty big news, if it is true or even being considered. I
expect that it is. For those that are somehow unaware of the traditional
Tibetan systems of reincarnation and transfer of authority, the Dalai
Lama (and almost every other major lama) is considered to be the
reincarnation of those that have come before him. The current one is the
14th in the series (the Karmapa is the 17th of his line). When a lama
dies, there are traditional methods to find his next incarnation once he
is born and to confirm him as this incarnation. The child found is then
taken into the monastic system and trained until adulthood in Buddhist
teachings, practices, and other things he'll need to know as an
incarnation of that line. Traditionally, certain monasteries or
positions are always held by an individual in the line. This is how the
current Dalai Lama was running the government in Lhasa when the Chinese
invaded when we was a boy. It is expected that the current Dalai Lama,
who is quite old, will explicitly continue this tradition. During the
time period when the reincarnated Dalai Lama is not yet an adult, his
responsibilities go to a regent or set of regents (and many political
shenanigans have resulted from this in the past). The article is saying
that the current Karmapa, who is quite young and fairly well respected,
may wind up fulfilling this role. As some may recall, I took a trip to
Seattle early this year in order to [see the 17th
Karmapa](http://www.arcanology.com/2008/06/03/starbucks-buddhism/) on
his first ever visit to the United States. (Since escaping from Chinese
control and fleeing to India years ago, his movements have been pretty
curtailed.) I found the Karmapa to be a pretty inspiring and even
progressive figure from my brief exposure to him and his teaching during
that visit. He's definitely forward looking in his approach, open
minded, and he speaks English fairly well. His influence could have a
dramatic impact on the course of events for the Tibetans in their
diaspora if he does become regent.
