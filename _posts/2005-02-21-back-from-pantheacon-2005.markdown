We're home at last. I didn't really have a lot of time over the weekend
to write as much as before. Maybe I'll put something together in the
next couple of days. Pantheacon 2005 was fun though it reaffirmed my
desire to wear "normal" clothes and to never wear a tunic. We attended
some neat workshops and I had some engaging and occasionally drunk
conversations with many a pagan and magician at a number of parties. Due
to limiting myself to only a few drinks last night, I feel ok today. As
always, everyone thinks my mom is cool though I got revenge by her
wandering into a party across the way from the one that I was at and
having a stranger (to her) look at her badge as soon as she came in and
say "Oh, he's in the other party" to her. Heh. I also had a nice chat
with Thorn Coyle about her **Evolutionary Witchcraft** book since I
started using parts of it in my prison work recently. I haven't seen how
the guys feel about it yet but I quite like the book. Her friend,
Francis, also delighted us with tales about his years as a bouncer in
questionable clubs and why only ugly, straight people seem to have a
requirement to have sex in public. I also got to spend some time hanging
out with Sam Webster and we had a long chat about recent difficulties
and resolved the issues to, I think, our mutual satisfaction.
