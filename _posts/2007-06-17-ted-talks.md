Before a couple of months ago, I did not have much awareness of <a href="http://www.ted.com">TED</a> or the TED Talks. TED defines itself and the talks site with:
<blockquote>"TED stands for Technology, Entertainment, Design. It started out (in 1984) as a conference bringing together people from those three worlds. Since then its scope has become ever broader.

The annual conference now brings together the world's most fascinating thinkers and doers, who are challenged to give the talk of their lives (in 18 minutes).

This site makes the best talks and performances from TED available to the public, for free. More than 100 talks from our archive are now available, with more added each week. These videos are released under a Creative Commons license, so they can be freely shared and reposted.

Our mission: Spreading ideas."</blockquote>
There are some excellent talks on this site. Here are a few examples:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/71">Rick Warren: Living a Life with a Purpose</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/66">Sir Ken Robinson: Do schools kill creativity?</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/121">James Howard Kunstler on suburbia</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/11">Jane Goodall on what separates us from the apes</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/102">Dan Dennett on our consciousness</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/28">Seth Godin on sliced bread</a></li>
</ul>
I encourage those so inclined to go check it out. There is some neat stuff on the site.
