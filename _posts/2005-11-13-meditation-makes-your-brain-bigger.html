<p>Interesting news on the meditation front. I'm glad this sort of work is being  done.</p> <p>From Livescience.com via <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/space/20051111/sc_space/meditateonthisbuddhisttraditionthickenspartsofthebrain&printer=1;_ylt=Aha8P8ZUgmUt9zF0413VZ3H737YB;_ylu=X3oDMTA3MXN1bHE0BHNlYwN0bWE-"> Yahoo News</a>:</p> <h2>Meditate on This: <br /> Buddhist Tradition Thickens Parts of the Brain </h2> <p> 	<em class="timedate">Fri Nov 11,12:00 PM ET</em></p> <p>Meditation alters brain patterns in ways that are likely permanent,  scientists have known. But a new study shows key parts of the brain actually get  thicker through the practice.</p>  <p>Brain imaging of regular working folks who meditate regularly revealed  increased thickness in cortical regions related to sensory, auditory and visual  perception, as well as internal perception -- the automatic monitoring of heart  rate or breathing, for example. </p>  <p>The study also indicates that regular meditation may slow age-related  thinning of the frontal cortex.</p>  <p>&quot;What is most fascinating to me is the suggestion that meditation practice  can change anyone's gray matter,&quot; said study team member Jeremy Gray, an  assistant professor of psychology at Yale. &quot;The study participants were people  with jobs and families. They just meditated on average 40 minutes each day, you  don't have to be a monk.&quot;</p>  <p>The research was led by Sara Lazar, assistant in psychology at Massachusetts  General Hospital. It is detailed in the November issue of the journal  NeuroReport.</p>  <p>The study involved a small number of people, just 20. All had extensive  training in Buddhist Insight meditation. But the researchers say the results are  significant.</p>  <p>Most of the brain regions identified to be changed through meditation were  found in the right hemisphere, which is essential for sustaining attention. And  attention is the focus of the meditation.</p>  <p>Other forms of yoga and meditation likely have a similar impact on brain  structure, the researchers speculate, but each tradition probably has a slightly  different pattern of cortical thickening based on the specific mental exercises  involved.</p>
