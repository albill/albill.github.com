I realized today that I actually don't have any good sources to the traditional Roman Catholic and Church of England views concerning the soul, its nature, the afterlife, etc. especially during the 19th century.

I know what I know from a general education concerning the Bible but it would probably be good to have access to a specific 19th century source or too if I want to talk about some of the influences on the Golden Dawn's view of the soul. I know various members of the Golden Dawn were Catholic and members of the Church of England so the view that these bodies would have on the soul would probably be somewhat influential on these individuals.

If anyone has any suggestions to offer, please leave a comment or e-mail me. Thanks!
