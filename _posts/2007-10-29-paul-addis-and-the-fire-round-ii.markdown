Good ol' Paul "I'm going to burn the Man at Burning Man" Addis was just arrested in the last day for apparently trying to burn down Grace Cathedral in San Francisco.

According to the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/29/BAGJT2QQB.DTL&amp;tsp=1">San Francisco Chronicle</a>:
<blockquote>Paul David Addis, 35, was arrested on the cathedral steps at 11:40 p.m. Sunday by police who said they had been tipped that someone intended to set fire to the Episcopal church, police spokesman Sgt. Steve Mannina said.

Addis was wearing an old ammunition belt that carried small explosives, Mannina said. He was booked on suspicion of attempted arson, possession of an incendiary substance, possession of explosives and possession of explosives with intent to terrorize a church.

[...]

Tabak said police didn't know what Addis' alleged motive was. "He said something about it was his religious right," Tabak said.</blockquote>
I'm nearly speechless here at the sheer audacity of this crazy fire bug. This guy is even more nuts than I thought! It's kind of incredible in a way.

I wonder how this is going to develop... I like crazy people. They make me feel more normal.
