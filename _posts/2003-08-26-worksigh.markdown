Wow, people are <b>really</b> going apeshit at work over the Blaster virus.

I spent hours in meetings today discussing plans in relation to it and how certain of our plans are changing, timelines moving up, etc. to try to do our share in keeping horrible things like it from happening again. Some of them are really good but the whole thing just makes my head hurt. A bunch of people all keyed up and one of them empowered by a senior VP to go make things happen.

<b>What a clusterfuck.</b>

It will all work out in the end but my guys are probably going to be randomized by this shit for months and it blows my schedule out of the water.
