R and I watched **[Lone Wolf and Cub: White Heaven in
Hell](http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=70000330)** this
evening. This is the sixth [Lone Wolf and
Cub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Wolf_and_Cub) movie and it turns
out that we accidentally skipped the fifth so we'll need to go back and
watch it now. The cheese factor in it does get a bit high, as much as I
love the series (and the manga) overall. The super tunneling foes and
the "entire Yagyu Snow Combat Brigade" chasing Lone Wolf on skis
complete the hot-dog ski jumps is a little too much. It reminds me of
James Bond movies from the same period (early 70s) with the Yagyu clan
chief as the SPECTRE villian.

I was exposed to the comics when it was first re-released in the late
80s and my mother, of all people, has actually collected all of the
issues from that original run. I have the manga style editions of the
first twelve books or so. I still love these and they are great reading.
Recently, I've been reading the related (intersecting characters)
**Samurai Executioner** manga as its volumes are released.
