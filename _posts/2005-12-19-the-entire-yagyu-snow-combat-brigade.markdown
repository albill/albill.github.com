<p>R and I watched <strong><a href="http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=70000330">Lone Wolf and Cub: White Heaven in Hell</a></strong> this evening. This is the sixth <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Wolf_and_Cub">Lone Wolf and Cub</a> movie and it turns out that we accidentally skipped the fifth so we'll need to go back and watch it now. The cheese factor in it does get a bit high, as much as I love the series (and the manga) overall. The super tunneling foes and the "entire Yagyu Snow Combat Brigade" chasing Lone Wolf on skis complete the hot-dog ski jumps is a little too much. It reminds me of James Bond movies from the same period (early 70s) with the Yagyu clan chief as the SPECTRE villian.</p>

<p>I was exposed to the comics when it was first re-released in the late 80s and my mother, of all people, has actually collected all of the issues from that original run. I have the manga style editions of the first twelve books or so. I still love these and they are great reading. Recently, I've been reading the related (intersecting characters) <strong>Samurai Executioner</strong> manga as its volumes are released.
