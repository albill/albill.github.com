Today has been an especially long day. Today and tomorrow are the second
annual Leads Offsite for leads on the Windows Client team at Microsoft.
I spent my entire day at a nice retreat center sitting at a table while
various people did presentations on client issues, engineering process,
and various other tasks or issues. In between each session, we had a ten
minute discussion at each of our round tables (with 10 people at each
table) and then we had to stand up and give a take-away or three from
the presentation as redacted by those of us at the table. We did get a
nice lunch and coffee was ever flowing but it makes for a long day away
from the day to day work (which nags in the back of all of our minds). I
then went from this to a coffee shop to work on my Latin homework for
tonight and then to my Latin 102 class, which I missed the first couple
of weeks of while in Greece. I'm catching up but I'm still behind. I got
home around 9:30 PM, made dinner and then finished watching **Supercop**
on the Tivo with R. We're enjoying the device though I haven't had a
chance to watch the **Trigun** and **Cowboy Bebop** episodes that I've
started recording (I've never watched either of these before). R seems
to like **Reign**, an anime that looks visually reminiscent of **Aeon
Flux**. I haven't watched any of that one yet but probably will... Off
to bed now for a day of breakout sessions tomorrow. In the evening, my
daughter will come over to spend the night and then we're all going
hiking with on Saturday.
