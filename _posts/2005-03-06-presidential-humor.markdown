A lobbyist, on his way home from work in Washington, DC, came to a dead
halt in traffic and thought to himself, "Wow, this traffic seems worse
than usual." He noticed a police officer walking between the lines of
stopped cars so he rolled down his window and asked, "Officer, what's
the holdup?" The officer replied, "The President is depressed, so he
stopped his motorcade and is threatening to douse himself with gasoline
and set himself on fire. He says no one believes his stories about why
we went to war in Iraq, or the worsening deficit and economy, or that
his tax and the privatization of Social Security cuts will help anyone
except his wealthy friends. So we're taking up a collection for him."
The lobbyist asks, "How much have you got so far?" The officer replies,
"About four gallons."
