I'm attending a weekend Vajrakilaya retreat with a local Nyingma center the weekend after this next. I've been looking forward to this for a while and it should be an all day and early evening affair on both days (starting on Friday night, actually). I'll have an online brother (an acquaintance but a friend of friends) coming down from Canada for this. I offered to let him crash at my place.

Leading up to this, I made sure to find my old iron phurba and I wound up, through fortunate circumstances, getting an <em>excellent</em> deal on a very large Vajrakilaya thangka. It arrived today and I took some pictures of it.
