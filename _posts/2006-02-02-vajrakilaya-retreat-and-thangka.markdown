I'm attending a weekend Vajrakilaya retreat with a local Nyingma center
the weekend after this next. I've been looking forward to this for a
while and it should be an all day and early evening affair on both days
(starting on Friday night, actually). I'll have an online brother (an
acquaintance but a friend of friends) coming down from Canada for this.
I offered to let him crash at my place. Leading up to this, I made sure
to find my old iron phurba and I wound up, through fortunate
circumstances, getting an *excellent* deal on a very large Vajrakilaya
thangka. It arrived today and I took some pictures of it.
