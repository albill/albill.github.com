So, I've never read **Transmetropolitan** before. This is a rather kick
ass (and now defunct) comic series by Warren Ellis
([http://www.diepunyhumans.com](http://diepunyhumans.com)) about a
sociopathic journalist in some non-future named "Spider Jerusalem." This
is despite the fact that I read Warren's RSS feed from his site and am
on his badsignal e-mail list. Weird, eh? While R and I were out this
morning, I picked up the second graphic novel version of TM. This is
fairly early on in the series (obviously) but it kicks some serious ass.
I've been laughing my ass off on and off all day... Definitely good
reading for cynical bastards.
