So, we had the house inspected by <b>my</b> inspector this Thursday. Nothing too terribly extreme was found. There is dry rot in one section of siding (fairly limited) on a corner of the house caused by a incorrectly hung drainspout. Also, two out of the three front pillars need to be replaced (which are 20+ feet long lengths of 8" X 8" wood) because of water damage and a couple of other things. I&apos;m told that this isn&apos;t too unusual in buying a house or given our damp local climate.

R and I met with our agent this morning at Third Place books and went over the inspector&apos;s report. We prepared the documents to request the seller fix these problems and a couple of other minor things. The estimation, including labor, is that they&apos;ll cost about $2,500 but we offered $1,000 over her asking price (because we knew another offer was on the table) so we&apos;re thinking that she&apos;ll probably fix them. We&apos;ll find out in the next few days. We&apos;re still on track to move in within a month unless there is a fight about this stuff. 

The Papyri Magic list seems to have taken off pretty well, better than a number of ths lists I&apos;ve run over the years. No one has ripped anyone a new asshole yet either. I added some more stuff to my site at <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/pgm/">http://www.hermetic.com/pgm/</a> as well. This and its connection to Neoplatonism is probably the main form of magic that I study and work with on occasion that isn&apos;t connected to any of my social or order involvements unless you want to count the Tibetan Buddhist stuff.

On that front, I&apos;m going to be in New York City from August 29 through 31 <b>OR</b> I&apos;m going to be in Conway, MA from September 9 through 15. It isn&apos;t clear yet. The default is going to NYC though as I have a friend who has volunteered crash space for me and it&apos;s the cheapest place to fly. This is for Namkhai Norbu&apos;s Dzogchen teachings or for a particular retreat with him, respectively. I&apos;m also going to be attending a Dzogchen direct introduction and teaching from Lama Wangdor here in Seattle in July, which I&apos;ve volunteered to help organize if they need more bodies.

I&apos;m also likely to be going to Minneapolis to visit with my Ordo Astrum Sophiae brethren the weekend of September 6 so I&apos;ll either go to NYC for a long weekend, come home and go to Minneapolis the next weekend or I&apos;ll be going to Minneapolis, staying in that area for a couple of extra days and then going straight to Conway for the retreat. I need to buy my tickets soon but I haven&apos;t finalized everything.
