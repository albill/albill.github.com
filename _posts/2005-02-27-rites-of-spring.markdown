<p>I guess spring is here. It hasn&#39;t rained in about two weeks and it has been 
55 to 60 almost every day this week. This weekend was the beginning of our rites 
of spring: yardwork. R did a bunch of weeding in the flowerbeds and mowed the 
front and side of the house. I just did a once over for our backyard on the 
highest setting. This is the first mowing in a few months. I&#39;ll have to go over 
it again this week.</p>
<p>I must say it is odd to be doing all of this in February. Blame global 
warming or El Nino or something. Meanwhile, I keep hearing about the record 
floods in California. Sorry about that, guys, that was our rain.</p>
<p>Today, after I dropped Madeline off at home, R and I went to the gnostic mass 
and witnessed the ordination of our friend, Oniyeh, as a priestess of the&nbsp; 
Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica. It was quite nice to see this and she was obviously 
very moved by the experience.</p>
<p>I also just received my grade for my first philosophy paper. I got an &quot;A&quot; on 
it, which is two for two for my first papers for each class. Let&#39;s see if I can 
continue the trend. This prof actually returned a marked up word file of my 
first paper so I could see what he was looking at to some degree. This is the 
one that I didn&#39;t get R to proof and I (and the prof) found two typos but that 
isn&#39;t as bad as I feared.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still considering thesis topics. I&#39;ll probably keep the history 
concentration. I&#39;m leaning towards something to do with American fraternal 
orders though I&#39;ll probably avoid the masons because of my own membership. 
Co-masonry may be an option though.</p>
