I guess spring is here. It hasn't rained in about two weeks and it has
been 55 to 60 almost every day this week. This weekend was the beginning
of our rites of spring: yardwork. R did a bunch of weeding in the
flowerbeds and mowed the front and side of the house. I just did a once
over for our backyard on the highest setting. This is the first mowing
in a few months. I'll have to go over it again this week.

I must say it is odd to be doing all of this in February. Blame global
warming or El Nino or something. Meanwhile, I keep hearing about the
record floods in California. Sorry about that, guys, that was our rain.

Today, after I dropped Madeline off at home, R and I went to the gnostic
mass and witnessed the ordination of our friend, Oniyeh, as a priestess
of the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica. It was quite nice to see this and
she was obviously very moved by the experience.

I also just received my grade for my first philosophy paper. I got an
"A" on it, which is two for two for my first papers for each class.
Let's see if I can continue the trend. This prof actually returned a
marked up word file of my first paper so I could see what he was looking
at to some degree. This is the one that I didn't get R to proof and I
(and the prof) found two typos but that isn't as bad as I feared.

I'm still considering thesis topics. I'll probably keep the history
concentration. I'm leaning towards something to do with American
fraternal orders though I'll probably avoid the masons because of my own
membership. Co-masonry may be an option though.
