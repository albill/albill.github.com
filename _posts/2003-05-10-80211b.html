So I&apos;ve got 802.11b working on my PocketPC now. It&apos;s kind of amusing that the card for it is a third the size of my card at work but whatever... I&apos;m pretty happy with it. 

I&apos;m wondering if anyone knows of any wireless utilities and programs for the PocketPC. I&apos;ve got e-mail and messenger (though I really detest IM) and I&apos;m resisting the urge to put telnet on but some tools for sifting the ambient wireless network that I might be sitting in would be cool. ;-)
