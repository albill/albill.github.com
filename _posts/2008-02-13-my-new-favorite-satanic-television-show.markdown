A change of pace from all of the Buddhism, tech work, and such for once.
R and I have recently watched all of **[Lucy, the Daughter of the
Devil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy,_the_Daughter_of_the_Devil)**
from [Adult Swim](http://www.adultswim.com/video/index.html). I'm very
sad that there are only 11 short episodes but, as a plus, I included
portions of them below. They involve the 21 year old, female anti-christ
and her attempts to date D. J. Jesus and relate to her father, Satan.
Then there are the two "Special" Fathers and the "Special" Sister sent
by the Vatican to eliminate her. The Vampire Altar Boys made me laugh
and laugh. and then there is the send up of Burning Man... as a veteran
attendee, I almost cried, I was laughing so hard. and: It is definitely
worth checking out for easy laughs.
