There be spoilers ahead. Don't read further if you care and haven't seen the seaon opener for season 3 of Battlestar Galactica. Wow, I just got done watching the new episode. The show continues to twist in turn. Whereas the first two seasons hewed closely to the intent, if not the content, behind the original show, the new season goes off the rails in a new direction. We have the surviving humans (about 7,000 in this one place) on "New Caprica" living under cylon occupation. The episode deals with themes of quislings, suicide bombers and their justification (on the side of the "good" guys), torture of illegal detainees, and mass murder in unmarked graves. Pretty heavy stuff for a science fiction show on mainstream television. I'll be surprised if there aren't some people in parts of the U.S. freaking out about the content of the show, disclaimers or not. I am utterly impressed by the balls of the writers and to see this on the air in the current political atmosphere. It was actually decently written as well. My hat is off to the creators of the show.
