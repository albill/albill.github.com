So I've got 802.11b working on my PocketPC now. It's kind of amusing
that the card for it is a third the size of my card at work but
whatever... I'm pretty happy with it. I'm wondering if anyone knows of
any wireless utilities and programs for the PocketPC. I've got e-mail
and messenger (though I really detest IM) and I'm resisting the urge to
put telnet on but some tools for sifting the ambient wireless network
that I might be sitting in would be cool. ;-)
