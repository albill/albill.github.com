I'm on my second night in Los Angeles right now. I'm staying at the Disneyland Hotel while attending the Star West conference here. Star West is a QA conference and I'm down here with my boss and another coworker.

Today was the first big set of sessions. There were some interesting bits and it was definitely thought provoking. It's also very clear that the state of QA is very sad in much of the industry. As much as I (and others) kvetch and moan about testing at our jobs and the problems that we face, we seem to be lightyears ahead of many of our professional peers. I heard quite a few problems outlined today as being very common for testers that are problems that we recognized and took efforts to deal with years ago. They don't always get fixed but my work seems to address problems that other people seem to be only realizing exist.

At the end of the day, Scott (my boss) and Levent, and I decided to go over to Disneyland, of course. As convention attendees, we were able to get more affordable "evening" tickets for the last four hours of the day. Levent had never been befoe and I hadn't been in 10 1/2 years. We went over there, did the Indiana Jones Adventure, Splash Mountain, Pirates of the Carribean and many other rides. One special thing of note is that they converted the Haunted Mansion for the upcoming Christmas holiday so it is now a "Nightmare Before Christmas" Haunted Mansion. It was actually pretty cool and my favorite of the evening.

We stayed for the fireworks and left just before closing on the monorail back to our hotel. It was a nice change of pace from a day of sitting in chairs listening to people do presentations or keynotes. Tomorrow will be more of the same, as will part of Friday.

I'm online through dialup right now but I forgot my battery charger so... :-)
