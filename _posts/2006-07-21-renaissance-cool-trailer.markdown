This trailer simply kicked ass. I'm looking forward to seeing this movie in my "I was a teenage Gibson fan" bones.

On the film's website, there is a <a href="http://www.renaissance-movie.com/clip_popup.html">link</a> to a clip from it.

There is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_(film)">wikipedia entry</a> on the movie as well.
