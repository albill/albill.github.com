This trailer simply kicked ass. I'm looking forward to seeing this movie
in my "I was a teenage Gibson fan" bones.

On the film's website, there is a
[link](http://www.renaissance-movie.com/clip_popup.html) to a clip from
it. There is a [wikipedia
entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_(film)) on the movie as
well. ![Renaissance
