We drove out from Nafplio to Epidaurus, about 25 km away. It is a fairly large site and the longtime home to the Asclepius cult. There are extant writings on stele of the mythic origins of the cult preserved there along with a lot of statuary. We wandered around the site for a while along with the huge ampitheatre that is preserved there. We also looked through the small museum on site. Both of us are getting a bit tired of being in strange cities surrounded by non-English and some rather odd customs. The trip is winding down. Tomorrow, we go into Athens for the last few days before flying home Tuesday (local) morning. We should be back in Seattle by the evening of the same day with the time shifts. In Athens, we&apos;ll be staying with a friend of R&apos;s for at least a day. I&apos;m hoping to wash some clothes!!
