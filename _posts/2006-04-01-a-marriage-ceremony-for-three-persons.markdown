This is the marriage ceremony that I performed last Sunday. I am the
"Celebrant" in this though I was copied down as "Buddhist Priest" on the
marriage certificate by Rubylou. Rubylou and J are women. Drake is a
man. Drake and J have been acquaintances and then friends of mine for
about five years or so. Rubylou is one of my oldest friends at this
point. She and I worked together in a bookstore in 1993 and 1994 and
dated for a while about five or so years after that. She's a Christian
of a more gnostic sort and attends a variety of places for services
(between Catholicism and more open churches) along with retreats. Drake
identifies as Catholic but has been involved in a Zendo off and on. I'm
not sure about Jeliza's spiritual beliefs. The ritual was put together
by Rubylou and had no input from me beyond some suggestions concerning
the joining of the three through the bit with the wine at the end. Doing
a ceremony involving a triad instead of a dyad is somewhat unusual in my
experience (leaving aside the unusual nature of marrying three people in
a same sex group marriage).

## A Marriage Ceremony for Three Persons

**Celebrant:**

> If life has any meaning to us at all, it possesses it because of love.
> Love enriches our human experience. It is the reason for the peace in
> the family and the peace of the peoples of the Earth. A meeting
> between those who are made for each other is a beautiful miracle. We
> are united to witness the marriage of three such people. Jeliza,
> Drake, and Rubylou's understanding of the true meaning of marriage has
> resulted from many influences; their families, their friends, and
> their own personal beliefs and experiences. What defines their love
> today will change and grow to new depth in the future. It takes three
> seconds to say: “I love you”, but it can take a lifetime to show it.
> This ceremony is the celebration of a single stage in a much larger
> process that is the love between life partners. The promises made
> today and the ties that are bound here greatly strengthen your union.
> They will cross the years of each soul's growth. Do you seek to begin
> this ceremony?

**All:** Yes, we do. **Celebrant:**

> The human soul shares characteristics with all things divine. It is
> this belief that assigns virtues to the cardinal directions: North,
> South, East and West. Let us offer a blessing in support of this
> ceremony. Blessed be this union with the gifts of the East:
> communication of the heart, mind, and body, fresh beginnings with the
> rising of each sun, and the knowledge of growth found in the sharing
> of silence. Blessed be this union with the gifts of the South: warmth
> of hearth and home, the heat of the heart's passion and the light
> created by all to lighten the darkest of times. Blessed be this union
> with the gifts of the West: the deep commitments of the lake, the
> swift excitement of the river, the refreshing cleansing of the rain
> and the all-encompassing passion of the sea. Blessed be this union
> with the gifts of the North: firm foundation on which to build,
> fertility of the fields to enrich your lives, and a stable home to
> which you may always return. Now I ask you to join hands and state
> your intentions.

> deepening love they share. You are now wife, husband, and wife.
