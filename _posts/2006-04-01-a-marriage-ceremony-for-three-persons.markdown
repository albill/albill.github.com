This is the marriage ceremony that I performed last Sunday. I am the "Celebrant" in this though I was copied down as "Buddhist Priest" on the marriage certificate by Rubylou. Rubylou and J are women. Drake is a man. Drake and J have been acquaintances and then friends of mine for about five years or so. Rubylou is one of my oldest friends at this point. She and I worked together in a bookstore in 1993 and 1994 and dated for a while about five or so years after that. She's a Christian of a more gnostic sort and attends a variety of places for services (between Catholicism and more open churches) along with retreats. Drake identifies as Catholic but has been involved in a Zendo off and on. I'm not sure about Jeliza's spiritual beliefs.

The ritual was put together by Rubylou and had no input from me beyond some suggestions concerning the joining of the three through the bit with the wine at the end. Doing a ceremony involving a triad instead of a dyad is somewhat unusual in my experience (leaving aside the unusual nature of marrying three people in a same sex group marriage).
<h2>A Marriage Ceremony for Three Persons</h2>
<strong>Celebrant:</strong>
<blockquote>If life has any meaning to us  at all, it possesses it because of love. Love enriches our human experience. It  is the reason for the peace in the family and the peace of the peoples of the  Earth. A meeting between those who are made for each other is a beautiful  miracle. We are united to witness the marriage of three such people.

Jeliza, Drake, and Rubylou's  understanding of the true meaning of marriage has resulted from many influences;  their families, their friends, and their own personal beliefs and experiences.  What defines their love today will change and grow to new depth in the future.  It takes three seconds to say: “I love you”, but it can take a lifetime to show  it. This ceremony is the celebration of a single stage in a much larger process  that is the love between life partners. The promises made today and the ties  that are bound here greatly strengthen your union. They will cross the years of  each soul's growth.

Do you seek to begin this  ceremony?</blockquote>
<strong>All:</strong> Yes, we do.

<strong>Celebrant:</strong>
<blockquote>The human soul shares  characteristics with all things divine. It is this belief that assigns virtues  to the cardinal directions: North, South, East and West. Let us offer a blessing  in support of this ceremony.

Blessed be this union with  the gifts of the East: communication of the heart, mind, and body, fresh  beginnings with the rising of each sun, and the knowledge of growth found in the  sharing of silence.

Blessed be this union with  the gifts of the South: warmth of hearth and home, the heat of the heart's  passion and the light created by all to lighten the darkest of times.

Blessed be this union with  the gifts of the West: the deep commitments of the lake, the swift excitement of  the river, the refreshing cleansing of the rain and the all-encompassing passion  of the sea.

Blessed be this union with  the gifts of the North: firm foundation on which to build, fertility of the  fields to enrich your lives, and a stable home to which you may always return.

Now I ask you to join hands  and state your intentions.</blockquote>

&lt;<em>The Mixing of Wine from Three Chalices into One Chalice and then Back to  the Three is done here. All three drink</em>&gt;

<strong>Celebrant:</strong>

<blockquote>Spirit of Love, may Jeliza,  Drake, and Rubylou know great love together, and may they live in the desire to  always support each other in positive and uplifting ways. May they strengthen  one another in sorrow, share with one another in gladness, and be companions to  each other in times of silence. May their home be a haven for themselves, their  children, their family and friends, and wherever they are plagued by changing  fortune, may they be united not in word and outward form alone, but by the  presence in the hearts of each, of the deepening love they share. You are now  wife, husband, and wife.</blockquote>

&lt;<em>The Three celebrate with a kiss</em>&gt;
