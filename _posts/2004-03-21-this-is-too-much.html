<b>Yasser Arafat Says Gibson Film Not Anti-Semitic</b>

 RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) -   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat (<a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22Yasser%0AArafat%22&amp;c=&amp;n=20&amp;yn=c&amp;c=news&amp;cs=nw">news</a> - <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=yasser+arafat">web sites</a>) watched Mel Gibsons's controversial "Passion of the Christ" at a private screening on Saturday and said it was not anti-Semitic, officials said.

He watched the film -- which Jewish groups say may foment anti-Semitic attacks -- with Palestinian Muslim and Christian leaders at his headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah. 

 "The president did not feel the film was anti-Semitic," said Hanan Ashrawi, a prominent Palestinian Christian who watched it with him on a DVD copy. 

Arafat's advisor Nabil Abu Rdainah told the official Palestinian news agency WAFA the 74-year-old former guerrilla leader had hailed the film as "moving and historical." 

Jewish groups say Gibson's epic of the last 12 hours of Jesus's life could foment anti-Semitism with its graphic depiction of the torture and crucifixion of Jesus. 

 German church leaders have also said its "overly negative portrayal" of Jews risked stoking anti-Semitic prejudice.
