As people may have noticed (my mother has), I have not been blogging as much during the last six months as before. I have been blogging, first on Livejournal, and then here, since 2001. Like all bloggers, I go through more and less motivated periods.

Right now, with the increase in things like Twitter and Facebook, there are a lot more distractions in the area of online communication. I post shorter links and interesting bits on my @openbuddha twitter account more often than mentioning things here (and that is mirrored to my Facebook account). I have also still been fighting the horrible insomnia that I have had since my protracted illness last winter. While I have recovered from the illness, the insomnia has been a real issue, leaving me with, on average, a night or two a week where I really don't sleep and no nights where I sleep all night. (I haven't slept all night since November of last year.) This has left me with a lot less energy and motivation to work on the blog a lot of the time when I have other things to get done. It is also not a very interesting topic to others so I don't talk about it much anymore.

I've checked my statistics and I have a couple of hundred people that read my blog. What I don't know at this point is what it is that people who read my blog want to read. I have been thinking of refocusing the blog in a new direction, since it has often been all over the map with my various interests, but I don't even know what people come here to read or why they subscribe to my feed. 

What I am interested in hearing is why you, as a reader, read my blog, and what sort of thing you'd like to read here. If I can get responses to those questions, I can decide how I want to change direction without completely alienating my existing readers. 

I don't want to stop blogging but I want to be more focused in what I do blog about in the future. I am starting my doctoral program at the end of the month and going part-time at my job at Mozilla, so it is likely that my mindset is going to be more focused on academia and Buddhist Studies much of the time.
