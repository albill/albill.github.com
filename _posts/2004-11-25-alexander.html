She's not much for seeing movies during opening week but I was insistent. Apparantly, it was "Al gets his way Day." (I got to pick the Chinese food place afterwards too!)

It is an Oliver Stone movie and ol' Ollie seems to have a fixation on semi-mythological figures, be they Nixon, JFK, or, in this instance, Alexander the Great.

Some parts of it were exceptional such as the vision of the city of Babylon. I also thought the one major battle scene with the Persians was well-done though R found it gruesome. Personally, I prefer that the battle scenes be gruesome. Warfare is a horrid, horrid thing and it is not pretty and it should not be glorified. There are acts of glory and heroism that occur in war but it is also a brutal thing and grinds up people like nothing else. I dislike the old movies that show these huge battles like pageants but don't show the horror of people losing limbs, eyes, bleeding everywhere, etc. Not something you'd want to see normally though.

I think Oliver Stone would have been better served showing Alexander's rise to power and his conquest of Eqypt and then the Persians. That would have been a much tighter scope that would have allowed for more character display/development.
