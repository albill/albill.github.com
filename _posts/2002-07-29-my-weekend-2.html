This weekend was pretty busy but good. This is the first time R and I have had a significant amount of time in the house together since we moved in. Normally, she gets home after I've gone to bed unless I'm up extremely late.

I did get to see China Mieville read from "The Scar" on Friday night at the University Bookstore. He did about 45 minutes of questions and answers afterwards and I got to ask him a couple of questions. He seems pretty interesting and not pretentious at all. I'm not sure what I expected but I liked him. He had a good sense of humor.

Saturday morning we slept in very late, which we've been trying to get away from over the last few months... We got up and went to this coffee house that make crepes that's only a few blocks away. introduced me to the place earlier this year. Yummy breakfast! I was supposed to go back to my old apartment to clean it a bit and to get some more of the boxes of random stuff that are sitting in it but the day kept getting later and later. We watched <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0165499">Storm Riders</a>, which had been recommended to me after we saw "The Duel" a month or so ago. I must say that while the effects were cool, the whole thing was a bit on the heavy handed cheezy side. I mean, most Hong Kong kung fu and sorcery movies are cheezy but this one was based on a comic book and it showed. "The Duel" was a lot better and a lot more bawdy, which made it amusing.

R and I made tacos and then decided that we had to watch something else. Instead of going out to rent, we watched <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120586">American History X</a>, which I own but R had never seen. It stars Ed Norton as a skinhead gang leader and is not a happy film. I found it to be very powerful though and I like it quite a bit. I'm not sure of R's opinion overall though. It doesn't leave you in a happy space though... Eventually I made it over to my old apartment and dragged a bunch of boxes of things home including my altar for home.

Sunday we again wound up sleeping late and R and I cooked breakfast together. Ah, happy domestic bliss. ;-P

In the early afternoon, Charly and J rolled by as they were in the neighborhood and decided to show up on our doorstep. J had helped me move but trapecia had never seen the place so R gave the tour while J and I discussed Mithras, my book collection and <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/timaeus.html">Timaeus</a>. The Cabiri have a performing gig next week which is based around Timaeus for the script so it is a bit on J's mind. I have a minor part in the production (no singing, dancing or fire-spinning except in a smoky sense).

After they took off, R went to help some friends move and I went and got Madeline, my daughter. She and I went out for a while down in Seattle and I went and moved more crap out of my apartment afterwards. Hopefully my neighbors don't get too pissed about a 70% full dumpster of my old shit. How I managed to both acquire and keep so much crap over these years and as many moves as I had amazes me. Somehow I don't think I'm going to get my damage deposit back though. My cats did wonders for the carpet in one of the closets and it will need to be repaced I bet... ah well, that's why I paid a cat deposit for each of them I suppose.

Tomorrow is yet another fun day of work and then a Cabiri practice for the Timaeus show.

Aurum Solis stuff still has not calmed down. I'm sick of bullshit group politics though. The only groups that I&apos;ve ever had a lot of success with in the long term were though that I started or help start. Hopefully things calm down a bit and those of us in North America can continue largely as before. We shall see though.
