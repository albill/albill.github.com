This must be my week for getting advanced reader's copies of books. I
received a copy of **[Seeds of
Change](http://www.amazon.com/Seeds-Change-Tobias-S-Buckell/dp/0809573105/)**
today from the editor, [John Joseph
Adams](http://www.johnjosephadams.com/). He's made some electronic PDF
copies available to bloggers and some others for review. Given the
guidelines from him, I won't have the review up until August, a couple
of weeks before the book comes out. The book description is:

> Imagine the moment when the present ends, and the future begins - when
> the world we knew is no more and a brave new world is thrust upon us.
> Gathering stories by nine of today's most incisive minds, Seeds of
> Change confronts the pivotal issues facing our society today: racism,
> global warming, peak oil, technological advancement, and political
> revolution. Many serve as a call to action. How will you change with
> the future? These nine stories sow seeds of change across familiar and
> foreign territory, from our own backyards to the Niger Delta to worlds
> not yet discovered. Pepper, the mysterious mercenary from Tobias S.
> Buckell's Crystal Rain and Ragamuffin, works as an agent for change -
> if the price is right - in "Resistance." Ken MacLeod envisions the
> end-game in the Middle East in "A Dance Called Armageddon." New writer
> Blake Charlton imagines a revolutionary advance in cancer research in
> "Endosymbiont." Award-winning author Jay Lake tackles technological
> change and the forces that will stop at nothing to prevent it in "The
> Future by Degrees." Other stories by K.D. Wentworth, Jeremiah Tolbert,
> Mark Budz, Ted Kosmatka, and Nnedi Okorafor-Mbachu range from the
> darkly satirical to the exotic. All explore the notion that change
> will come.

[Ken MacLeod](http://kenmacleod.blogspot.com/) has been a favorite
author of mine for most of a decade. I'm a big fan of Tobias Buckell and
his work (including his [blog](http://www.tobiasbuckell.com/)) and I
just finished Jay Lake's
**[Mainspring](http://www.amazon.com/Mainspring-Jay-Lake/dp/0765356368)**
a couple of days ago. Overall, this looks to be a fine collection of
authors and an interesting focus for an anthology. I expect that I'll
enjoy it.
