We're attending the Thelemic Symposium on Saturday night.

Earlier in the afternoon, I'll be at Seket-Maat Lodge using the library there to try to get copies of some of the material related to my thesis work. I'll also be bringing a couple of things down for the lodge.

R and I are staying at the <a href="http://www.markspencer.com/">Mark Spencer Hotel</a> a block from Powell's in downtown so I expect to get some good book shopping in as well. We should be back in Seattle by Sunday afternoon.
