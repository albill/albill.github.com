I used to be a big fan of <a href="http://www.illwillpress.com/">Ill Will Press</a> and Foamy the Squirrel a few years back. I have a Foamy coffee mug (with him giving the finger) and a DVD that my wife bought for me. At least one person is convinced that I sound like Foamy when I start ranting (hi, Sean!).

I lost track of Foamy as the schtick started getting a bit old but I came across this today. It is Foamy ranting about the use of Zen in American Marketing (your old Dharma Burgers). I just about fell out of my chair laughing but then I love the angry squirrel. 

"The Zen of Anger is all you need to master. Arrrgh!"

I encourage everyone to take a moment out for a little decompression with a rant from Foamy. Watch it below or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw5lsBHecvM">here</a>.
