As most people watching the weather know, we had our "once every few years" snowstorm in Seattle yesterday. Things got covered completely and almost no one went to work. A lot of people kvetch about how badly the locals here drive in the Snow but considering that it usually snows about once a year and even then it rarely stays (winter is rain here mostly), of course no one knows how to drive. Also, the area is very hilly and a lot of people (like me!) don't have chains... In any case, I stayed home and telecommuted for a while into work. I then bummed around a bit on the net and read my book. Last night, the freezing rain began and it started to warm up (from 17 to around freezing). This morning, the roads were mostly icy slush and I made it into work. The only wrinkle in all of this is that my power died in the middle of the night last night. So, I woke up around 5:30 AM with no lights and no heat. I slept it but, no, it was all still off when I got up (though it was well above freezing at that point). I called my house an hour ago and my answering machine answered so it seems that power is restored. I am very pleased.
