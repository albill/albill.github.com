I just announced over on [openbuddha.com](http://www.openbuddha.com) that I'm effectively closing that blog. I've also changed my twitter username from [openbuddha](http://www.twitter.com/openbuddha) to [makehacklearn](http://www.twitter.com/makehacklearn) as part of doing so. I'm moving my blog focus here to blog about more hackerish things, which have been more my public interest for some time and less about talking in public about spirituality, which was effectively the focus of the site. I figured that I'd mention it here as well since I did change twitter usernames. I still figure that my blogging will be somewhat irregular!
