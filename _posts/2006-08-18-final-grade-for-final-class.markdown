I have received my last paper back for my last normal class in my Master's program. I only have the one credit thesis prep class left (whenever they let me take it). I received a 4.0 for my last class, which gives me a 4.0 grade point average for my 24 credits of graduate work over the last 1 1/2 years. While I did not initially care much about my GPA, the fact that I have managed to retain a perfect GPA, only getting a 'B' on one paper for the entire coursework, makes me relatively happy.
