<p>I filled out an application today for the Master of Arts in Humanities at
<a href="http://www.csudh.edu/hux/">California State University, Dominguez Hills</a>. 
This is an accredited MA program at one of the CSU schools outside of Los 
Angeles. They&#39;ve been doing this for 30 years this year and are part of the 
California State University system so accrediting is fairly solid.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t my first choice for a program. I kept hoping the
<a href="http://www.naropa.edu">Naropa</a> would reinstitute their MA in 
Buddhist Studies that they <i>almost</i> started a year ago but it doesn&#39;t seem 
like it is happening. The CSU program is actually relatively cheap ($5K over a 
couple of years) and it will have me write a master&#39;s thesis on an approved 
topic of my choice. I&#39;ll end the program with an accredited MA and a thesis to 
show for it (along with the education, one supposes). </p>
<p>I was actually accepted to this program back in 1995 when I was only a couple 
of years out of the university but life situations caused me to decide to wait 
to start taking classes at that time. That was within a year of my getting into 
the tech industry and getting married for the first time.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still trying to figure out a good way to learn at least basic Tibetan as 
well but it looks like self-teaching might be the only real option. With the 
full-time job that I have and an MA program along with getting married and 
having my daughter, I might be full up on stuff for a couple of years. With any 
luck and some work, I&#39;ll be done with my degree in about two years if I work at 
it a bit. </p>
<p>Assuming that I get accepted, I&#39;ll start classes in January. Since this is a 
distance program, it&#39;s mostly reading and writing papers, which I was always 
fairly good at so I&#39;m not worried about doing that end of it at all. It&#39;s more a 
matter of keeping focus over the next year or two.</p>
<p>I have some ideas for thesis topics within History or Philosophy relating to 
Western Esotericism so it should be interesting.</p>
