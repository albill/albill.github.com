R and I are hanging out with the people from the local
[Shambhala](http://www.shambhala.org/) center this weekend. A couple of
years ago (wow), we attended their Level I [Shambhala
Training](http://www.shambhala.org/shambhala-training.php) together.
This was before R had taken refuge or attended any Buddhist retreats or
events (as far as I know). The basic Shambhala Training is offered in
five classes (imaginatively labeled "Level I", "Level II", etc. though
they do have other names). These five levels are an introduction to
Shamatha practice with some Vipassana thrown in (at least from what I
can tell, only ever having taken the first). Each class is taught as a
weekend intensive. They do a Friday night lecture with instructions and
maybe a short sitting session. Then it is group sitting all day Saturday
and Sunday. We're supposed to arrive at 8:30 AM on the mornings and it
goes until about 7:00 PM, though there is a lunch break in there
somewhere. I've long been a fan of Chogyam Trungpa's work and
Shamatha/Vipassana practices are fairly similar, at least across
Mahayana traditions. I'm interested in how they teach these in a graded
series and how they develop the practice. It is also an opportunity to
get some more intense sitting practice done in a supportive setting with
other practitioners. It is also something that R and I can do together
(even if it is a solo event in another sense). We'll see how I feel
tomorrow or Sunday night but I'm looking forward to it. I've never been
to the Berkeley Shambhala Center though it is one of the oldest in the
country. I probably should not have had as much coffee as I've had this
afternoon though... Unfortunately, R has had a bad cold for a few days
and I have feeling that I've picked it up as well. This could turn an...
enlightening experience into one of the hell realms. We'll see how it
goes though. As an aside, there are a series of videos on Google Video
on Trungpa's vision of an enlightened society and the Shambhala
Tradition. Here is the first one but there are at least four more:
