Great. I have over a month off from school and the holidays coming off so work will be lighter than normal. Because of this, I reinstalled World of Warcraft to have some fun.

After installing, an hour of downloading updates and re-enabling my frozen account, I log in and find my old characters still in place. Great!

I log into the world and immediately get the blue screen of death (BSOD) when the world renders. The cause? My ATI video drivers (per the memory dump) for my Radeon 9800. I go to the ATI site and get new drivers that only came out two days ago. Update, reboot, etc. Log in and BSOD again.

Fuck. How much patience do I have to troubleshoot video driver issues for my own home machine? Don't I do this enough at work?
