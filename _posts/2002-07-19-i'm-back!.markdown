<strong>Iacchos!</strong> I'm back from the San Bernadino Forest in California. I was there until Wenesday afternoon and then spent the last day in Palm Springs (which is as soulless as Las Vegas). I stepped off of my plane 2 1/2 hours ago and am digging through my e-mail now. I had an excellent time. Now I get to move to my new house with R the day after tomorrow. Argh.
