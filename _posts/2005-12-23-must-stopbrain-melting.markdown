This is just the weirdest thing that I've seen in a while. I'm a
Vajrayana practitioner (at least of sorts) but I've spent the last 16 or
so years as a pagan as well. This whole thing just crosses my wires.

![Celtic Buddhist
Mandala](http://www.arcanology.com/images/mandala-whole.jpg)

This image is explained at
[http://www.celticbuddhism.org/thangkas\_mandala\_notes.htm](http://www.celticbuddhism.org/thangkas_mandala_notes.htm)
as **The Iconography of the Mandala of Celtic Buddhism**. I've read the
book that they publish, which is really on the founder's life with
Chogyam Trungpa. I can't figure out if their "Celtic Buddhism" is as
kitchy as it seems and a hodge-podge or if it is inspired. (Probably the
former though unless there is something miraculous going on...)
