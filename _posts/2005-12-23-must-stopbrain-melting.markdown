This is just the weirdest thing that I've seen in a while. I'm a Vajrayana  practitioner (at least of sorts) but I've spent the last 16 or so years as a  pagan as well. This whole thing just crosses my wires.
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/mandala-whole.jpg" alt="Celtic Buddhist Mandala" border="0" height="495" width="450" /></p>
This image is explained at <a href="http://www.celticbuddhism.org/thangkas_mandala_notes.htm"> http://www.celticbuddhism.org/thangkas_mandala_notes.htm</a> as <strong>The  Iconography of the Mandala of Celtic Buddhism</strong>. I've read the book that they  publish, which is really on the founder's life with Chogyam Trungpa. I can't  figure out if their "Celtic Buddhism" is as kitchy as it seems and a hodge-podge  or if it is inspired. (Probably the former though unless there is something  miraculous going on...)
