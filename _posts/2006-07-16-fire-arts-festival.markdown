R and I went to the Fire Arts Festival put on by the Crucible last
night. We met up with my recent friend, Autumn, and her husband. The
event was quite a bit of fun. Lots of fire, lots of Burning Man derived
or related art. The highlight of the evening for us was watching
**Dance, Dance Immolation**. DDI is a take on Dance, Dance Revolution
with the addition of flame proof bunny suits and flamethrowers. When a
player makes too many mistakes or the MC feels so inclined, they get a
flamethrower blast in the face. Lots of fun for the whole family! Here
are a few pictures from [my
set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157594200045324/) on
Flickr. We weren't supposed to take photos so I left my real camera at
home. The rule turned out to be completely unenforced with many people
taking photos so I did a few with my camera on my phone. I apologize for
quality issues.
