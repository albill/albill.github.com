I finally bit the bullet and bought tickets to see Cirque Du Soleil tomorrow. I missed it two years ago and kicked myself ever since. I even got us good seats so R and I can enjoy the show.

From their site:<blockquote>Dralion is the fusion of ancient Chinese circus tradition and the avant-garde approach of Cirque du Soleil. The show&apos;s name is drawn from its two main symbols-the dragon, representing the East, and the lion, representing the West. Dralion derives much of its inspiration from Eastern philosophy with its perpetual quest for harmony between humankind and nature. 
 
Suspended in time between the past and the future, Dralion is a celebration of life and the four elements that maintain the natural order: air, water, fire and earth. Innovation soars to new heights as it defies the laws of nature. Dralion is a dynamic performance that transcends the boundaries of the imagination and leads us into a dreamscape with a new and sparkling perspective. </blockquote>
