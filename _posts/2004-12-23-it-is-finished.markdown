I took Freya to the vet. They gave her a sedative while I held her. When she was relaxed, they took her away for the IV to stop her heart. I didn't need to watch that. She was sweet at the end.

Ah well. Other than Doodle the Ferret, who was much more Rebecca's baby, this is the first pet that I've lost as an adult and the only one that I had raised from a baby.
