<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/2122006596/" title="firefox3-beta2 by albill, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2266/2122006596_a09cd67e54_m.jpg" width="240" align="right" height="194" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="firefox3-beta2" border="1" /></a>After a lot of work by everyone in the Mozilla Community, the second beta of Firefox 3 went live just a short while ago (with a robot!).

Notable improvements are all over the place but especially in the <a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2007/11/firefox-3-location-bar-just-became-almighty/">Awesome Bar</a> and Places (the updated Bookmark and History system), where the organizer has been improved along with the "smart" folders that query the <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">database backend</a>. You can take a look at the <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Places">API documentation for Places</a> if you want more information. You can also see the overall <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Places:Fx3UIPlan">UI plan for it</a>, if you're so inclined. I think Places is one of the great things in this release but then I do some of the QA for it so I am biased.

The <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Firefox_3_for_developers">Firefox 3 pages</a> for developers are up at the <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Developer Center</a> now as well if you are interested.

Mozilla Links has been <a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/category/subject/firefox3/">posting on Firefox 3</a> on a regular basis and I expect that there will be more posted there for this Beta 2 release.

You can download Beta 2 on the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html">beta download page</a>.
