[![firefox3-beta2](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2266/2122006596_a09cd67e54_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/2122006596/ "firefox3-beta2 by albill, on Flickr")After
a lot of work by everyone in the Mozilla Community, the second beta of
Firefox 3 went live just a short while ago (with a robot!). Notable
improvements are all over the place but especially in the [Awesome
Bar](http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2007/11/firefox-3-location-bar-just-became-almighty/)
and Places (the updated Bookmark and History system), where the
organizer has been improved along with the "smart" folders that query
the [database backend](http://www.sqlite.org/). You can take a look at
the [API documentation for
Places](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Places) if you want more
information. You can also see the overall [UI plan for
it](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Places:Fx3UIPlan), if you're so inclined. I
think Places is one of the great things in this release but then I do
some of the QA for it so I am biased. The [Firefox 3
pages](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Firefox_3_for_developers)
for developers are up at the [Mozilla Developer
Center](http://developer.mozilla.org/) now as well if you are
interested. Mozilla Links has been [posting on Firefox
3](http://mozillalinks.org/wp/category/subject/firefox3/) on a regular
basis and I expect that there will be more posted there for this Beta 2
release. You can download Beta 2 on the [beta download
page](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html).
