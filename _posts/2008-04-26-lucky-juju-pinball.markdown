Tonight, R and I went to [Lucky JuJu
Pinball](http://www.ujuju.com/index.php) in Alameda. (For the
non-locals, Alameda is a small city on island in the Bay next to
Oakland.) Lucky JuJu Pinball is, you guessed it, a pinball place. It is
only open on the weekends and is filled with a variety of pinball
machines, both old school and more modern digital devices. The place
charges a ten dollar fee and you can stay and play all you want. They
have a [list of their machines](http://www.ujuju.com/pinballs.php) on
their website. The **Embryon** and [**Orbitor
1**](http://www.ujuju.com/item.php?id=581) machines were my two favorite
of the bunch. This is the Embryon:

It had a lot of cool lights, shiny bits, and a third flipper up near the
top for a fun play. I took somes closeups of the shiny joy as well:

The Orbitor 1 was just downright weird. It has a three dimensional
surface with curves and spinning bumpers. The way the ball moves, it
would seem like their were a bunch of magnets underneath but the link
above claims that this is not the case, that it is done with the shape
of the space and the spinning bumpers. The picture doesn't really convey
it well but I did take a few:

I put a [set of photos
up](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157604736566085/) on
Flickr this evening after we got back if you want to take a look. It was
good fun and I'm glad that we finally took the time to get down there.
We had encountered their traveling RV full of pinball machines at the
Cruicible's fire festival in previous years but it was only a sample of
the machines that they have. According to their site, the three rooms
have three dozen machines available for play.
