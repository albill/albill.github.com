Nullsoft has a program called "Safesex" which is an encrypted notetaker.

<a href="http://www.nullsoft.com/free/safesex/">http://www.nullsoft.com/free/safesex/</a>.

<em>In 1998 Nullsoft brought you Sex, a little virtual notepad for "scribbling" things down. Then we made the UI a little different, but never released it. Fast forward to 2002, and we added encryption and better profile support to Sex, and called it SafeSex.</em>

<em>SafeSex allows you to have some notes that are easily accessible, but relatively secure. It sits on your screen, waiting for a click, and on a click it will activate and give you access to your notes. That is, of course, if you enter the passphrase that your notes are encrypted with. For ease, the passphrase will be cached in memory, and expire after a user-configurable time.</em>

<em>The notes themselves are stored in RTF, and encrypted when stored to disk. When the SafeSex window is not open, the notes are not stored in memory. They are encrypted and decrypted on demand.</em>

<em>The encryption used is Blowfish, using the 20 byte SHA-1 of the passphrase as the key. It uses Blowfish in CBC mode, with the initialization vector being incremented every time.</em>

<em>SafeSex keeps running in the background, using very little memory and resources, and automatically keeps itself running across reboots (i.e. if you reboot with SafeSex running, it will come back on startup)</em>.

Cool shit!
