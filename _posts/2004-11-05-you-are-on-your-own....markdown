No one is going to save you. There is no rescue party on its way. You are on your own. You control your destiny and are responsible for your success or failures. The Bodhisattvas, the angels, the gods, will help you if you ask but they will only help. They will not take responsibility for you. They will not do your work for you. It is up to you to do what needs to be done, whether you take their advice or not. You are on your own and it shouldn't be any other way. You are a child of earth and starry heaven. You can do this.
