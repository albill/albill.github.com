It is amazing how little people talk about Katrina and its aftereffects (or the city of New Orleans) over a year after the fact.

Maybe people assume that it has all been dealt with but the k-hole still exists. New Orleans has, I've heard, less than half of the population it had before the hole was ripped through the area. Infrastructure is still in dire straits and it doesn't seem to be getting much better.

This could be <strong>your</strong> city if the right disaster came through. I live in one of the worst earthquake zones in the U.S. and this is something I think about: whether I and my friends and family are on our own in the case of the emergency on a vast scale.

I still cannot believe that the nation that managed the Berlin airlift during the Cold War couldn't evacuate New Orleans or actively help the people stuck there afterwards. Of course, then there are the words of the Legendary K.O.:
<blockquote>I ain't saying he's a goldigger,
but he ain't messing with no broke niggas
I ain't saying he a goldigger,
but he ain't messing with no broke niggas

George Bush don't like black people
George Bush don't like black people

Hurricane came through, fucked us up round                 here
Government acting like it's bad luck down here
All I know is that you better bring some trucks round here
Wonder why I got my middle finger up round here

People lives on the line you declining to                 help
Since you taking so much time we surviving ourself
Just me and my pets, and my kids, and my spouse, trapped
In my own house looking for a way out (pause)

Five days in this motherfucking attic
Can't use the cellphone I keep getting static
Dying 'cause they lying instead of telling us the truth
Other day the helicopters got my neighbors off the roof (off the                 roof)

Screwed 'cause they say they coming back                 for us too
That was three days ago, I don't see no rescue
See a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
Since God made the path that I'm trying to walk through

Swam to the store, tryin' to look for food
Corner store's kinda flooded so I broke my way through
I got what I could but before I got through
News say the police shot a black man trying to loot</blockquote>
