From <a href="http://www.low-carb-friends.com/bbs/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=92670">http://www.low-carb-friends.com/bbs/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=92670</a>

<i>Here&apos;s a puzzler: do you count carbs in the Body of Christ?</i> <blockquote>I offer the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass twice on Sunday, 3 or 4 times during the weekdays. It is the only time wheat enters my system and alcohol too (I have been in recovery 14 years). Being an Episcopalian (World-wide Anglican Communion, with the Church of England as our &apos;mother church&apos;) we believe the bread and wine really become Body and Blood (we call it the Doctrine of the Real Presence). And if Jesus commands it (John 6:50 and following) then he will not use it to harm me but rather to my greater sanctification. </blockquote>

That&apos;s a hard one. heh.
