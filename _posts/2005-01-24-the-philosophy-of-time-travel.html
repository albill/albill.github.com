I like Donnie Darko. I like it a lot. 

So, I'm happy to see that other people have gone to the trouble of creating interesting sites around it.

For your enjoyment, <b><a href="http://www.tangent-universe.org/dump/time_travel.html">The Philosophy of Time Travel</a></b>.<blockquote><i><h2>The Manipulated Living</h2>The Manipulated Living are often the close friends and neighbours of the Living Receiver.

They are prone to irrational, bizarre, and often violent behaviour.
This is the unfortunate result of their task, which is to assist the
Living Receiver in returning the Artifact to the Primary Universe.

The Manipulated Living will do anything to save themselves from Oblivion.</i></blockquote>
