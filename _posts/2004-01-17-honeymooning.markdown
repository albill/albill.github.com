Since R and I are still planning, however loosely, to get married this
year, we've been discussing honeymoon possibilities. I'm still fairly
intent on Italy, since we went to Greece last year. I'd love to see
Rome, Venice, Florence, etc. R would **really** like to go to Turkey but
we're not sure about American tourists travelling in Turkey with Iraq
next door and the fact that much of Turkey, outside of the cities, is
your typical Turkish muslim sort of thing, which might not be feeling
real friendly right now... Once possibility is Thailand. I just found
one friendly acquaintance of mine's travel report from her honeymoon
