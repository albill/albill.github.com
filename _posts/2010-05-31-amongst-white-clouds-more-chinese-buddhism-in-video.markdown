Rev. Paul Lynch, my preceptor and the head of the [Five Mountain
Sangha](http://www.fivemountain.org/), just did a [blog
post](http://zenmirror.blogspot.com/2010/05/amongst-white-clouds.html)
about "[Amongst White Clouds](http://www.amongstclouds.com)," a Buddhist
documentary filmed a few years back. Since I've been posting a bit about
videos, especially Buddhist documentaries recently, I thought I'd
mention it as well. It is a film about Chinese Buddhist hermits living
in the Zhongnan Mountains of China. The filmmaker, Edward Burger,
wanders around interviewing various hermits to ask them about their
practice and why they live that way up in the mountain. It is quite
interesting and the Journal of Buddhist Ethics has a
[review](http://www.buddhistethics.org/14/kirkpatrick-review.html) of it
online as well that gives it a positive evaluation. It turns out that
the entire video is up on [Google
Video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5902279151658995270&hl=en#)
as well so it can be watched online. I've embedded it below for people
viewing my blog locally. Go give it a watch if you've got time to kill
(and, if you're reading this, you probably do...).
