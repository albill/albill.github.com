Yesterday, I finished the novel, <strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765311313">Orphans of Chaos</a></strong>,  by John Wright. Be warned, it is a two part novel just like his Everness books  were. I didn't realize it until I got near the end and was wondering how it was  going to be wrapped up quickly. I must say that I enjoyed it quite a bit. I had  heard some criticism of the combination of seeming kids boarding school and  sexuality but I found it non-jarring. After all, the "orphans" of the books are,  at worst, in their mid-teens and, without giving away plot points, they may be  quite a bit both older and younger than that.

Like Wright's <strong>Everness</strong> duology, there is the combination of Classical  mythology with other bits (like Christianity and Albion/Arthurian bits). Based  on his first trilogy plus these books, it is clear that Wright has a wonderful  love of the Classical myths but also a relatively deep cultural knowledge of  Christian and other myths (or at least enough to appear to have a deep  knowledge...). In the Everness books, the "gods" appear, at various points as  Greek deities, faery beings from the milieu of Oberon and Titania, and as  archangels of the Lord while being the same actual beings between these  identities. As a magician, I found this to be comfortable territory and Wright  continues this kind of thing in the Chaos books.

The main issue at hand in those books is the conflict between the Olympians,  who are the children of Zeus and, before him, of Saturn, and their created world  and the the Titans or "Uranians," who exist outside the created world and aren't  too happy about it being there, locking people away in our reality. There are  strong Gnostic overtones with Saturn as a demiurge who creates the world for  reasons unknown and sucks the souls (by accident or on purpose) of most of  non-existence into it, locking them into his rules, forms, and power structure  with only a few Uranians escaping from this to rebuild their own realities. They  want their people back... There are also strong elemental themes and different  (and conflicting) forms of magical paradigms. Good stuff.

I'm now reading David Marusek's <strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765312670/">Counting Heads</a></strong>,  which comes highly recommended.

While I was out yesterday, I also picked up some library books that were  waiting and a couple that I just found. I'm going to be reading <strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159030134X">At Hell's Gate: A  Soldier's Journey from War to Peace</a></strong> soon as well. This looks to be a  just amazing book and it is actually relatively short. I also picked up a  library copy of the Chogyam Trungpa biography but I'm not sure if I will read  that cover to cover rather than picking sections out of it.
