My Tivo knows that I love Jackie Chan movies so records them for me. Tonight R and I had a seemingly rare weekday evening together (between classes for both of us and friends, we can be out a bit). She made a nice dinner for us and we proceeded to watch <b>The Legend of the Drunken Master</b>, which I&apos;d never seen before. I sometimes forget how good of a martial artist, at least for performance, Jackie Chan really did. Watching him move in this movie and knowing that he does all of his own stunts, it was fairly impressive to watch in places. I give the film a thumbs up.

The Tivo is gradually recording more <b>Reign</b> so we&apos;ll be able to watch an hour or two of Alexander the Great and Pythagorean Ninjas again soon. I still haven&apos;t watched the <b>Cowboy Bebop</b> episodes that I&apos;ve been recording. Maybe this weekend though with a big Beltane event on Saturday, lodge on Sunday night and Madeline coming over, I&apos;m not sure when...
