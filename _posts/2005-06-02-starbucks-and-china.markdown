My friend and coworker, John, is in China on a business trip for our group this week. Via e-mail, he has confirmed that they have Starbucks in Beijing. There is, apparantly, one at the Forbidden City.

Should I be appalled or glad to know that if I go to the great sites of China, a latte will be waiting for me?
