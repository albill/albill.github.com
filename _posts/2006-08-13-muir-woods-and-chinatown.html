R and I took a drive out to the Muir Woods today. I had never been out there before.

Being from the Pacific Northwest, I am a great lover of trees so going to the forest is a nice change from the last couple of months of day to day in Oakland.

I've put a photoset of pictures I took there up on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157594234821434/">Flickr</a>.

After that, we took a visit to Chinatown in San Francisco. I had also never been there except driving through by accident. We had a late lunch at one of the restaurants and took a walk up and down Grant, looking at shops along the way. I bought a couple of silk cloths to use on my altar, a statue stand for one of my altar statues, and a couple of DVDs, including the recent movie about poachers in Tibet.
