Sweet. I have an Archos Jukebox 20 GB MP3 player. I've had it for a year and a half or so. There are two things I dislike about it:
<ol>
	<li>The USB 1.1 interface to move files onto it.</li>
	<li>The shitty control software compared to other players.</li>
</ol>
Well, I can't fix the first without buying a new player but I just found Rockbox, an open source project that wrote a whole new operating system for Archos players. I just installed it and it kicks ass.
