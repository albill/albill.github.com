Sweet. I have an Archos Jukebox 20 GB MP3 player. I've had it for a year
and a half or so. There are two things I dislike about it:

1.  The USB 1.1 interface to move files onto it.
2.  The shitty control software compared to other players.

Well, I can't fix the first without buying a new player but I just found
Rockbox, an open source project that wrote a whole new operating system
for Archos players. I just installed it and it kicks ass.
