I found two lists of Roman Virtues that don't quite match. I should look up the sources for these...

Virtue is an interesting concept. Something to be striven for, not something that is innate.

The first list:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Auctoritas</strong>: "Spiritual Authority" The sense of one's social standing, built up through experience, Pietas, and Industria.</li>
	<li><strong>Comitas</strong>: "Humor" Ease of manner, courtesy, openness, and friendliness.</li>
	<li><strong>Clementia</strong>: "Mercy" Mildness and gentleness.</li>
	<li><strong>Dignitas</strong>: "Dignity" A sense of self-worth, personal pride.</li>
	<li><strong>Firmitas</strong>: "Tenacity" Strength of mind, the ability to stick to one's purpose.</li>
	<li><strong>Frugalitas</strong>: "Frugalness" Economy and simplicity of style, without being miserly.</li>
	<li><strong>Gravitas</strong>: "Gravity" A sense of the importance of the matter at hand, responsibility and earnestness.</li>
	<li><strong>Honestas</strong>: "Respectibility" The image that one presents as a respectable member of society.</li>
	<li><strong>Humanitas</strong>: "Humanity" Refinement, civilization, learning, and being cultured.</li>
	<li><strong>Industria</strong>: "Industriousness" Hard work.</li>
	<li><strong>Pietas</strong>: "Dutifulness" More than religious piety; a respect for the natural order socially, politically, and religiously. Includes the ideas of patriotism and devotion to others.</li>
	<li><strong>Prudentia</strong>: "Prudence" Foresight, wisdom, and personal discretion.</li>
	<li><strong>Salubritas</strong>: "Wholesomeness" Health and cleanliness.</li>
	<li><strong>Severitas</strong>: "Sternness" Gravity, self-control.</li>
	<li><strong>Veritas</strong>: "Truthfulness" Honesty in dealing with others.</li>
</ul>
The second list (which seems a bit more true to form as a list though not as long):

<strong>Aequitas</strong>
