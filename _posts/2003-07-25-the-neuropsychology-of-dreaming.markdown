Excerpts:<blockquote>Based on recent findings in my own and other neuroscientific laboratories, I propose that dreams are indeed meaningful. Studies of the hippocampus (a brain structure crucial to memory), of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and of a brain wave called theta rhythm suggest that dreaming reflects a pivotal aspect of the processing of memory. In particular, studies of theta rhythm in subprimate animals have provided an evolutionary clue to the meaning of dreams. They appear to be the nightly record of a basic mammalian memory process: the means by which animals form strategies for survival and evaluate current experience in light of those strategies. The existence of this process may explain the meaning of dreams in human beings.<lj-cut text="read the rest">

At least one animal experiences slow-wave but not REM sleep - and, consequently, does not exhibit theta rhythm when asleep. This animal is the echidna, or spiny anteater, an egg-laying mammal (called a monotreme) that provides some insight into the origin of dreaming. The absense of REM sleep in the echidna suggests that this stage of the sleep cycle evolved some 140 million years ago, when marsupials and placentals diverged from the monotreme line (Monotremes were the first mammals to develop from reptiles.)<br /><br />By all evolutionary criteria, the perpretuation of a complex brain process such as REM sleep indicates that it serves an important function for the survival of mammalian species. Understanding that function might reveal the meaning of dreams.

...

The echidna has a large convoluted prefrontal cortex, larger in relation to the rest of the brain than that of any othermammal, even humans. I believe it needed this huge prefrontal cortex to perform a dual function: to react to incoming information in an appropriate manner based on past experince and to evaluate and store new information to aid in future survival. Without theta rhythm during REM sleep, the echidna would not be able to process information while it slept. (The echidna does, however, show theta rhythm when foraging for food.) For higher capabilities to develop, the prefrontal cortex would have to become increasingly large - beyond the capacity of the skull - unless another brain mechanism evolved.

REM sleep could have provided this new mechanism, allowing memory processing to occur "off-line." Coincident with the apparent development of REM sleep in marsupial and placental mammals was a remarkable neuroanatomical change: the prefrontal cortex was dramatically reduced in size. Far less prefrontal cortex was required to process information. That area of the brain could then develop to provide advanced perceptual and cognitive abilities in higher species.

The nature of REM sleep supports this evolutionary argument. During the day, animals gather information that involves locomotion and eye movement. The reprocessing of this information during REM sleep would not be easily separated from the locomotion related to the experience - such disassociation might be expecting too great a revision of brain circuitry. So to maintain sleep, locomotion had to be suppressed by inhibiting motor neurons. Suppressing eye movement was unnecessary because this activity does not disturb sleep.

...

With the evolution of REM sleep, each species could process the information most important for its survival, such as the location of food or the means of predation or escape - those activities during which theta rhythm is present. In REM sleep this information may be accessed again and integrated with past experience to provide an ongoing strategy for behavior.<br /><br />Although theta rhythm has not yet been demonstrated in primates, including humans, the brain signal provides a clue to the origin of dreaming in humans. Dreams may reflect a memory-processing mechanism inherited from lower species, in which information important for survival is reprocessed during REM sleep. This information may constitute the core of the unconscious.

Because animals do not possess language, the information they process during REM sleep is necessarily sensory. Consistent with our early mammalian origins, dreams in humans are sensory, primarily visual. Dreams do not take the form of verbal narration.<br /><br />Also in keeping with the role of REM sleep played in processing memories in animals, there is no functional necessity for this material to become conscious. Consciousness arose later in evolution in humans. But neither is there any reason for the material of dreams not to reach consciousness. Therefore, dreams can be remembered - most readily if awakening occurs during or shortly after REM sleep period.

Consistent with evolution and evidence derived from neuroscience and reports of dreams, I suggest that dreams reflect an individual&apos;s strategy for survival. The subjects of dreams are broad-ranging and complex, incorporating self-image, fears, insecurities, strengths, grandiose ideas, sexual orientation, desire, jealousy, and love. 

...

For reasons he could not possibly have known, Freud set forth a profound truth in his work. There is an unconscoius, and dreams are indeed the "royal road" to its understanding. However, the characteristics of the unconscious and associated processes of brain functioning are very different than Freud thought. Rather than being a cauldron of untamed passions and destructive wishes, I propose that the unconscious is a cohesive, continually active mental structure that takes note of life&apos;s experiences and reacts according to its own scheme of interpretation.</blockquote>
