R and I just watched <strong>The Proposition</strong> this evening. It is a Western set in Australia written by Nick Cave and accompanied by his music.

Visually, I found it an interesting film but, whoa!, what a bummer of a movie. The nasty brutishness of pointless craziness and violence of man against man.

I feel like I should watch <strong>Requiem for a Dream</strong> to cheer myself up or something.
