I received my copy of the graded version of my first assignment for my graduate World Religions class back from my professor while I was out of town. As I was warned, he does has spidery handwriting. On the plus side, he covered my paper in remarks, often as much as every other sentence with copious notes on the sides. I received an 'A' grade on the paper and lots of positive comments throughout, including ideas for areas to look into for some of the issues that I raise or questions that I ask. He closed with a long remark about the Jesuit education the prof had received and it forcing him to comment on everything. Overall, it was nice to both get a good grade and get such copious positive feedback. It makes me feel good about the paper, especially since it wasn't very easy for me to write. (Unlike most people in his class, I know too much about certain topics rather than too little. It makes it hard to scope what the assignments should really cover to achieve their goals.)
