R and I went into San Francisco this evening to see
"[Dream](http://www.dreamonstage.co.uk)" at
[SHN](http://www.shnsf.com/shows/show.asp?key=18&subkey=704) in the
Curran Theatre. R had been fortunate enough to win tickets to this
through BART, of all things. "Dream" is a version (retelling?) of
Shakespeare's "[A Midsummer Night's
Dream](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream) that
stars an Indian and Sri Lankan cast in all of the roles. The setting and
circumstances of the play are given an Indian viewpoint, including
language in much of it. The show toured India and then England before
coming to San Francisco. The show included a fairly minimalist set but
made use of a certain amount of acrobatics in order to utilize the
vertical space. The costumes, dancing, and singing were just beautiful.
I feel very fortunate to have gotten to see this. The only difficulty
for some will be the mix of languages. If you aren't familiar with the
story, when the actors switch from one language to another (which
happens quite often), you may become confused. You can see a [large
video](http://www.dreamonstage.co.uk/dream.mov) promoting the piece on
its [British website](http://www.dreamonstage.co.uk). Watch the video
for a good mix of little bits from the show. This was an incredible show
and I recommend that those of you in the Bay Area take the time to go to
it if you have the chance. You can read a [review of the
show](http://www.theaterdogs.net/2008/05/08/review-a-midsummer-night’s-dream’/)
with pictures. SHN has also done a podcast episode about the show, which
you can listen to
[here](http://shnsf.com/dynamic/widgets/link_1_3590.mp3), which includes
some audio from it, along with discussion.
