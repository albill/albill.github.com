I finally paid my University of Washington Alumni membership fee. I've
been expired for a year. The main reason to do this is that Alumni get a
library card to the University of Washington library system. While I
can't borrow as many books as a student, I have full access to their
library. This is good for me personally as well as, potentially, for my
research for my degree work. I went there on Wednesday night, got a new
library card, and picked up a few books:

-   **[The Mithras
    Liturgy](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/3161481283/)**
    by Hans Dieter Betz. I've wanted a copy of this book forever but it
    costs more than $100 and I'm not going to pay that much. It has a
    copy of the Greek text of the Mithras Liturgy from the Paris Codex
    of the Greek Magical Papyri, Betz's translation (which is the most
    recent and best done) and extensive notes on the meaning and
    references of particular phrases or words in it, along with a
    conversation about the origins and placement of this text.
-   **[Nine Ways of
    Bon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0877737398/)** by David
    Snellgrove. This is one of the few details texts on the Bon religion
    of Tibet and its practices. Given that Dzogchen exists as a Nyingma
    Buddhist tradition and a Bonpo tradition (probably originating
    there), I'm quite interested in Bon. I also plan on continuing to
    connect with the Bon teachers that I come across. This book is long
    long out of print and can only be had for $400+ from collectors. I
    knew that the UW Library had a copy and this was the primary reason
    I went there the other night.
-   **[Yoga and the Jesus Prayer
    Tradition](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0809126389/)** by
    Thomas Matus. This was a book recommended to me many years ago by
    John Michael Greer. It is a cross cultural look at Yogic practices
    and relating them to the Heart Centering prayer tradition in the
    West. The author is a Christian monk. Flipping through it, it seems
    pretty interesting.
-   **Kurukullakalpah**. This is a grimoire of Kurukulla practices in
    both Sanskrit and Tibetan (neither of which I read). The book only
    came out in 500 copies and I know people that have been trying to
    translate some of this material. I figured that I would photocopy it
    for possible future purposes since it is available to me and fairly
    rare.

I turned in my second Philosophy paper on Thursday. I have two weeks
until me seven or eight page second History paper is due. After this, I
have two more short Philosophy papers and one longer History paper which
will be an evaluation of a history book chosen by me. The criteria for
this book is that it has to be written by an actual historian on an
event or theme predating 1973. I found a copy of **[Under the Molehill:
An Elizabethan Spy
Story](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0300094507/)** by
John Bossy, the author of **Giordano Bruno and the Embassy Affair**.
This is a book about spying in Elizabethan England at the French
Embassy. It seems fairly interesting and the author is a PhD historian.
It also seems to be a fairly simple read about a focused subject matter,
which will make my life easier. Today, R and I slept in late (which was
nice), went out to breakfast together and got our taxes done. I plan to
spend the rest of the day relaxing, reading and maybe playing a game or
two or watching a movie. Something lowkey.
