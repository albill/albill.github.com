I've had a busy weekend and actually haven't had much of a chance to get on the computer for more than a brief e-mail or two. <a href="http://www.anunnaki.org/origins/">Origins II</a> went well. I'm not sure how many people showed up in total but the FUNC was pretty much filled by the end of the evening. I heard most of the alcohol was sold as well. I got drafted for impromptu fire safety duty which generally means crouching low and in front ready to put flaming friends out. ;-) Here are a couple of picture of the Cabiri mid-air with flaming torches from the show. We'll have details of the performance up on the <a href="http://www.anunnaki.org/productions">Anunnaki Productions page</a> soon. These are Charly and J wrapped around each other, hanging in mid-air and carrying flaming torches. <img width="403" height="269" border="2" src="http://www.zhangzhung.net/lj/peacock1-web.jpg" /> <img width="353" height="353" border="2" src="http://www.zhangzhung.net/lj/peacock2-web.jpg" /> Cool stuff. Some day I'll learn to do aerial work (whenever it gets offered in class). Avoiding the clinging and zombie-like grasp of Work, on Saturday R and I had a nice breakfast and spent some quality time together. We also got to watch the movie <a href="http://www.kfccinema.com/reviews/action/versus/versus.html">Versus</a>, a kind of Japanese Yakuza meets Night of the Living Dead movie. I found it highly entertaining, though mindless, and plan on purchasing it. During the course of the day, I went to the release party for my friend William's edition of the <em>Picatrix</em>, an important Arabic magical text that was very influential in Europe but which has never been translated into English until now. A summary of the Picatrix in general is <a href="http://www.esotericarchives.com/picatrix.htm">available</a> and you can <a href="http://www.blarg.net/~kiesel">contact William</a> if you are interested in purchasing it. It isn't cheap though. This was a nice event to attend and a number of people that I haven't seen in quite a while were there. We've been waiting years for this project to be done and to have the book in our hands so I was quite pleased. After this, I ran off to an OTO dinner celebration in honor of a local Brother who has been given a new role in the Order as a whole. There were 40+ people at this event, which was provided gratis by the local body, Horizon, as a celebration. I had an excellent time and got a chance to talk with number of local people that I don't usually get to sit down with... Today I had a fairly low-key day with R again. Since we normally only really get to see each other on the weekend for any period of time, it was nice to have a bit of quality time with her. We got breakfast and hit the Fremont Sunday Market. The only thing we purchased was a reproduction of an Athenian coin bearing the image of the goddess Athena on one side and the Owl, Olive Tree and Waning Moon (her symbols) on the other. This will make a fine addition to my altar. She and I eventually went to a ritual practice for the Black Sun Gathering (detailed a bit in <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=cadmus&itemid=54506">this post</a> of mine) and found out what roles we get to play in the main ritual there. I'm looking forward to the event and the ritual but aspects of it are kind of daunting for me. I'm sure I'll manage to do well though but I have some prepatory magical work that I have to do to lead up to it. All of this was followed by a lodge meeting for <em>Ouroboros Lodge</em>, the local magical group with whom I do my personal magical work. All in all, a fairly busy weekend and I'm only now getting home and having a chance to sit down.
