So, the house has apparantly passed the appraisal (cross fingers here because I trust my mortgage broker as far as I can drop-kick him) and the paperwork is going to underwriting. This means that we should be able to sign ze papers by the end of the week.

R and I have scheduled the moves to come on Friday the 27th (since the 28th, 29th, and 30th are all booked) to move all of our shit into the new house. Time to pack furiously!

Oh the flaccid joy of a new home without DSL. I don&apos;t think I can even order it until we move in...no phone, no dsl... (That&apos;s assuming that we can get it.)
