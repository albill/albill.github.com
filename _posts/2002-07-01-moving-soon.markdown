Well, R and I found out today we got the house (this is to rent...). As a bonus, in a way, we're moving in, technically, on 7/15 though we'll actually be out of town until 7/18. They didn't want to hold it for us until the end of the month. Since I paid last month's rent on my current place, I don't mind this at all. It will make the move easier for us without being a burden. Since we're moving so soon, we only have to pay a pro-rated half of the first month's rent plus a giant ass deposit (the deposit is a couple of hundred more than a month's rent) but no last month's. Moving out will be harder but we're moving in for a lot less than we expected so we have all of the money on hand. Yay!! We'll be having a house warming sometime in August, I assume, after we get moved in. I'm sure I'll invite my local LJ friends, especially since you guys are the core group of people that I've known for years anyway. I found an interesting site by accident today. (Actually, I can't recall where I saw the link now...) It is 
  
  <a href="http://www.fireninja.com/">http://www.fireninja.com</a>. This is the site for a fire dancer down in Portland, Oregon who specializes in staff spinning and the fire whip. He's got a bunch of moves that I've never seen before and one that I've seen once and couldn't figure out what the hell I'd seen. It's inspiring me with some new stuff to work on with my staff spinning, which hasn't been going anywhere dramatic lately. Anyway, I&apos;m off to fire spinning class now.
