My copy of **Yeats's Golden Dawn** by George Mills Harper has not been a
lot of use in my Golden Dawn research for my thesis. One appendix at the
back has been useful. It is the catalogue of books in the "Westcott
Hermetic Library" founded by...Westcott in 1891. The catalogue is from
1897 but it lists the books of the library, many of which would have
been in Westcott's personal collection earlier. Among these books, there
are Ginsburg's and Franck's books on the Kabbalah. There are also Thomas
Taylor's translations of Iamblichus' **On the Mysteries** and
Sallustius' **On the Gods and the World**. Since one section of my
thesis is on the antecedents to the Golden Dawn's conceptions of the
soul, it is very useful to know what texts Mathers and Westcott, as the
two architects of the Golden Dawn, had access to in their work. Both
published extensively during the time of the formation of the Golden
Dawn or just before it but having a list of books from a library that
Westcott founded strengthens my ability to point to things like Taylor's
translation of Iamblichus or Franck's writings on Kabbalah. The fact
that Westcott is the translator of published editions of Levi's work
helps there as well. Nothing "proves" anything but it helps with the
arguments about where their ideas were coming from before I get into the
Golden Dawn's own ideas concerning the nature, role, and structure of
the soul (my thesis topic) in their papers, ritual work, lectures, etc.
Happy Day.
