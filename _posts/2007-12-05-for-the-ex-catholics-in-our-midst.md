Like many, I grew up Roman Catholic. My mother was a convert from a form of Methodism before converting further to the truly odd (though I think Catholicism qualified to much of our family already).

As a child, I was one of the seemingly rare unmolested altar boys. I can safely say that I actually never had any really negative experiences as a Catholic and look upon the memories with unbelieving fondness. I'm just not terribly good at being a monotheist (or even much of a theist, really).
