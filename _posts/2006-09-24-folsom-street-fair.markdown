R and I went to the Folsom Street Fair with Sandy this afternoon. I'd
never been before and didn't want to miss out. The crowd was **HUGE**. I
took photos but there wasn't enough space to take many pictures because
it was wall to wall people everywhere. Eventually, we wandered over to
one of the stages and saw part of a set by [Smash-Up
Derby](http://www.smashupderby.com/) and then My Life with the Thrill
Kill Kult. The funny thing is that SUD was a much better band...

Good times. The [photo
set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157594298512822/) is up
on Flickr now and I expect that R will upload her own photos later.
***Edit**: Previous picture changed because of man with exposed penis
lurking in...rear.*
