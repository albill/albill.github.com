It is amazing the amount of drek that is on the Internet sometimes. I
was thinking about the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn today and my
thesis. Since I put it up on [Lulu](http://www.lulu.com) as a free
download, I happened to go there. I then made the mistake of doing a
search there on ["Golden
Dawn"](http://www.lulu.com/browse/search.php?fSubmitSearch=1&fSearch=golden+dawn&fPageNumber=7).
Whoa! 83 items! Of course, like anything in life, out of 83 items, 90%
are probably of sub-standard value. I must say that I wasn't overblown
by the things I saw there though I did see a few things from friends or
acquaintances of mine who are practicing magicians. Not exactly a center
of scholastic endeavor, unfortunately. I've been thinking of doing a
paper on Golden Dawn ritual, mapping the Neophyte ceremony using the
method of [Frits Staals](http://fritsstaal.googlepages.com/) that
Richard Payne makes us of in his analysis of the Ajikan in the **Journal
of Chinese Religion** and his dissertation on the Goma. I'm not fully
convinced that it is the best method but there seem to be no *excellent*
or even *good* methods of analyzing different rituals and comparing them
that aren't simply long discussions of them. At least this method
presents the data in a different manner. I've been wanting to try to
publish an essay or two in the field where I actually did my master's
and I figure that it wouldn't hurt on my doctoral application to have a
publication credit, if something I write is accepted and doesn't take
two years to show up. I am still surprised at how little actual academic
work is done on the Golden Dawn, of all things. I've also been
considering trying to publish the [Allan
Bennett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Bennett) rituals that [JFC
Fuller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFC_Fuller) copies down between
1906 and 1908. I have copies of most of this material from the Ransom
Center in Austin. I would have to get their permission, because it is
from their archive, but, as far as I know, given the date and history,
it is all public domain outside of it being in a collection. Fuller's
handwriting is pretty clear and the illustrations are very well
executed, as I've mentioned previously. Given the amount of work
involved, I'm not sure that it would be worth the work to transcribe
400+ pages of Fuller's handwriting in order to try to publish rituals of
the 1890s Golden Dawn. I mean, it might sell all of 100 copies.
