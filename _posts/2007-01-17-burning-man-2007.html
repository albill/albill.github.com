Burning Man tickets went on sail today. They start out at a lower price and work their way up so it is worth getting them early if possible.

R and I just purchased our tickets for this year so we're going to be going. I'm either going to see about organizing a camp or just camping on our own. The only way that I could see us being involved with another group is if we were involved from the get-go, which would mean soon.

I need to track down a few of the Buddhist practitioners that I know who are current or ex-burners and see if they might be interested in trying to figure something out.
