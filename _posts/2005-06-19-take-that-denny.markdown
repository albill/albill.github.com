<p>My friend Denny was mocking me this evening. It was his wife, Sophia&#39;s, 
birthday party. R and I went over in late afternoon to attend for a while. I&#39;d 
already spent the morning and most of the day with my daughter since it is 
Father&#39;s Day. The problem that I have is that I have two papers, one for each 
class, due this Friday, the 24th.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a major pain when the paper dates line up for classes because I can&#39;t 
just focus on one. (Sort of like life, I suppose.) The real wrinkle is that I&#39;m 
driving a state over on Friday afternoon to attend teachings from a Bon Lama 
that I know. I attended teachings with him last year and I have been wanting to 
maintain the connection. This means that I don&#39;t have time on Friday to work on 
the papers. </p>
<p>One of the papers is to be turned in by e-mail and I can do it up until 
Midnight on Friday. That means that, being the deadline guy that I am, I might 
work more on it on Friday. (Though, historically, I turn in the e-mail papers a 
day or two early). The other paper has to be mailed physically to the professor. 
Normally, he&#39;s not a stickler for dates as long as he gets them in the right 
general time. He doesn&#39;t care if it is a day or two (or week) late normally. 
I&#39;ve never been late but I know other students of his. The issue there is that 
he&#39;s given all of us an alternate address because he&#39;s attending his daughter&#39;s 
wedding and (presumably) staying with her. We have to send them to him there. 
Since we don&#39;t know when he&#39;s leaving, we probably need to get them in on 
time... This means that I need to mail the paper by Wednesday, early evening, at 
the latest.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I wanted to get some work done on my papers this weekend. 
With people over yesterday for the ritual work that my friend was teaching, the 
whole afternoon and early evening were a washout for school work. For late 
evening, I read scholastic criticisms and commentaries on <b>Sula</b>, which my 
literature paper is using. So, marginally useful but I get nervous the longer 
that I go without any sort of rough draft. I tend to write by doing. I&#39;m not a 
big outliner ahead of time. I get in my groove and just write.</p>
<p>When we were at the birthday party, I didn&#39;t want to stay forever (or drink a 
lot like others) because I knew I needed to get these papers done and I needed 
to work on them tonight. Denny gave me crap when we decided to leave (&quot;Another 
hour won&#39;t kill you!&quot; &quot;I&#39;ve got papers to grade tonight too&quot; and things like 
that). We forcibly extracted ourselves anyway and came home.</p>
<p>I am happy to report that in the last four hours (with probably three hours 
or so hours of work in that), I wrote nine and a half pages of draft for my 
World Religions paper. This is for an eight to ten page paper. The prof actually 
doesn&#39;t care if you go long if it is interesting but I do need to cut it down 
some. I haven&#39;t written my concluding page or so that ties things together but 
my overview (very high level) of the Three Ways of Salvation and the Four 
Permissible Goals in Hinduism contrasting these with the philosophy and way of 
the Buddha (which derived from these to a great extent as a cultural matrix) is 
done. I&#39;ll spend tomorrow night finishing the last section and then going over 
the whole thing repeatedly to clean it up. </p>
<p>Hopefully, R will proofread it for me then and I&#39;ll clean it up. If I&#39;m 
lucky, I can mail it by Tuesday evening and be done with it. That will just 
leave the literature paper. That one has an out in that we have four papers 
(this is #2) and we&#39;re allowed to be a week late with one paper without penalty. 
If I can&#39;t get it done before I leave town (or in the hotel that night on 
Friday), I&#39;ll e-mail the prof and tell him that it will be my late one. I want 
to avoid that because you always like to keep a wild card in your hand for the 
future.</p>
