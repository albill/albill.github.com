I just finished Cory Doctorow's new book, **[Eastern Standard
Tribe](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0765307596/)**,
this evening. I liked this one quite a bit but I have a feeling that it
will only really appeal to the geeky set. Lots of stuff about artificial
tribes of interest, which really already exist today, organized by time
zones because it is a natural affinity. The main character is a user
experience guy, which was amusing. The whole book was actually rather
short and I read almost all of it this evening. I should sit down and
read **[Singularity
Sky](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441010725/)** by his
buddy, Charles Stross soon as well. I have a copy here. [This
book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1930846258/) by him
looks like it will be a doozy as well. I'm finding that I enjoy reading
the current crop of science fiction authors who are also computer geeks
and professionals.

I did have an evil thought this evening: Since
[Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org) is open to the public in order to
make entries, would it be truly evil to make up, say, a spurious nation,
history, language, etc. and then add it to the encyclopedia? I bet
Prester John's kingdom could use a long and detailed history in the
wikipedia... Anyone up for a project? heh.
