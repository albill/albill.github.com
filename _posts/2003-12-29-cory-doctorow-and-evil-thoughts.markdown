I just finished Cory Doctorow&apos;s new book, <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0765307596/">Eastern Standard Tribe</a></b>, this evening. I liked this one quite a bit but I have a feeling that it will only really appeal to the geeky set. Lots of stuff about artificial tribes of interest, which really already exist today, organized by time zones because it is a natural affinity. The main character is a user experience guy, which was amusing. The whole book was actually rather short and I read almost all of it this evening. I should sit down and read <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441010725/">Singularity Sky</a></b> by his buddy, Charles Stross soon as well. I have a copy here. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1930846258/">This book</a> by him looks like it will be a doozy as well. I&apos;m finding that I enjoy reading the current crop of science fiction authors who are also computer geeks and professionals. <hr width="30%" />

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> is open to the public in order to make entries, would it be truly evil to make up, say, a spurious nation, history, language, etc. and then add it to the encyclopedia? I bet Prester John&apos;s kingdom could use a long and detailed history in the wikipedia... Anyone up for a project? heh.
