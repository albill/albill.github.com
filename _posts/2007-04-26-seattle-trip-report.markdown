I suppose that I should post something about my trip to Seattle for the
five people who care. :-) I went up on Friday morning last week and
stayed through Sunday evening. In that time, I shared a meal with 15
different people (including two tiny tots). I met with an additional two
people who chose not to break bread (they were either drinking coffee or
smoking something). I went to two Thai restaurants, one Spaghetti house,
two greasy spoon breakfast diners, and one random food court. One of my
friends actually cooked for me as well. Friday was mostly at Microsoft
or with ex-Microsoft (and ex-college) friends. I had lunch with three of
my coworkers and then got escorted around the building a bit so I could
say "Hi" to a bunch of my old coworkers as well. The place looks pretty
much the same but I'll have been gone a year in a couple of weeks. In
the evening, I stayed with my magician/pagan friends, Aion 131 and
Sophia and got to crash in the wonderful yurt that they have on their
property. Saturday was mostly spent at the Seattle Center's exhibit on
"Grossology" with my daughter which was terminated (without prejudice)
by a visit to the Space Needle. I hadn't been up there since I was a kid
so that was fun. On Sunday, following breakfast, I tried to get access
to a rare book, a ritual manual, that Sarastro had used his magical
librarian powers to have moved from a hidden location to one accessible
to me. Unfortunately, the library gnomes moved a bound volume of the
Japan quarterly from 1950 instead, which was quite a surprise. Sarastro
promised me revenge on said gnomes. The evening was closed by dinner
with my friend, Richard, which he cooked. Richard is my Neoplatonist
magician friend who also happens to be trained (in Taiwan) in Taoist
ritual practices and Tai Chi. He and I share a similar Buddhist
affiliation historically as well. Some of my readers will know him as
one of the two people I've dedicated my thesis to and Richard is the one
who taught me how important Neoplatonism is to the West as both a
philosophical tradition but also as a contemplative one (read Sarah
Rappe's "[Reading
Neoplatonism](http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Neoplatonism-Non-discursive-Thinking-Damascius/dp/0521651581/)"
for more information). I got home around midnight on Sunday night and
jumped back into the current busy mess which is my life. I've got photos
up on [my Flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/) (many
**many** photos) but they are not organized yet.
