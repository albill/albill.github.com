Some lightweight thought here before I go to bed. Is there a calculus of
souls that can be done in regards to ethics and moral imperatives? Early
in life, I was taught, "No," that there is a clear right and a clear
wrong. Doing the right thing for the wrong reasons or doing the wrong
thing for the right reasons was never allowable. There were rules and
they were meant to be followed. The world was black and white. Later on,
when I was no longer a child, this black and white turned into the
endless shade of gray that so many of us are completely mired within.
There was no moral compass provided for us. At best, people could find a
moral code or some form of honor and hold true to it. Then when you
repeatedly failed to live up to it, you could beat yourself about the
head and shoulders but think that at least you had a code of some sort
and tried. Now, I actually live with vows that I have sworn to follow.
In their most literal sense, they are like the black and white rules of
childhood. Tell no falsehoods and promote truth. Kill no one and promote
life. The truth is that seeing these as black and white rules does one
no good. No simple rule lives up to the reality of living in the real
world within which we all spend our lives. Tell no lies but when they
come for the Muslims and ask you if you know where they are, what do you
say? Do you weight the rules or make some have precedence over the
others? The truth of the matter is that the questions that these vows
make me ask are probably more important in some regard than the vows
themselves. That isn't to say that the vows are then disregarded but
they are a living thing that you must contend with, wrestle to the
ground, or, if not that, bend and flow with in some manner. The
contention, perhaps until there is no contention, somehow, is important.
All things to remember when someone at work asks me if I drank the last
of the coffee with a gleam in their eye...
