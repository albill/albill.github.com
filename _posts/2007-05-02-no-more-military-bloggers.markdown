The United States Army, in its infinite wisdom, has decided that
unfiltered discussions by soldiers is a bad thing. Because of this, new
directives have come down that may effective kill military blogging (and
potentially e-mail as well) by requiring troops to get the approval of
their commander before any post or, potentially, any other electronic
communication. This is discussed in an
[article](http://www.wired.com/politics/onlinerights/news/2007/05/army_bloggers?currentPage=1)
on Wired News. An excerpt is below:

> The new
> [rules](http://blog.wired.com/defense/files/army_reg_530_1_updated.pdf)
> (.pdf) obtained by Wired News require a commander be consulted before
> every blog update.
>
> "This is the final nail in the coffin for combat blogging," said
> retired paratrooper Matthew Burden, editor of [The Blog of
> War](http://www.blackfive.net/main/2006/09/the_blog_of_war.html)
> anthology. "No more military bloggers writing about their experiences
> in the combat zone. This is the best PR the military has -- it's most
> honest voice out of the war zone. And it's being silenced."
>
> [Army Regulation 530--1: Operations Security
> (OPSEC)](http://blog.wired.com/defense/files/army_reg_530_1_updated.pdf)
> (.pdf) restricts more than just blogs, however. Previous editions of
> the rules asked Army personnel to "consult with their immediate
> supervisor" before posting a document "that might contain sensitive
> and/or critical information in a public forum." The new version, in
> contrast, requires "an OPSEC review prior to publishing" anything --
> from "web log (blog) postings" to comments on internet message boards,
> from resumes to letters home.
