The United States Army, in its infinite wisdom, has decided that unfiltered discussions by soldiers is a bad thing. Because of this, new directives have come down that may effective kill military blogging (and potentially e-mail as well) by requiring troops to get the approval of their commander before any post or, potentially, any other electronic communication.

This is discussed in an <a href="http://www.wired.com/politics/onlinerights/news/2007/05/army_bloggers?currentPage=1">article</a> on Wired News. An excerpt is below:
<blockquote>
<p>The new <a href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/files/army_reg_530_1_updated.pdf">rules</a> (.pdf) obtained by Wired News require a commander be consulted before every blog update.</p>
<p> "This is the final nail in the coffin for combat blogging," said retired paratrooper Matthew Burden, editor of <a href="http://www.blackfive.net/main/2006/09/the_blog_of_war.html"><cite>The Blog of War</cite></a> anthology. "No more military bloggers writing about their experiences in the combat zone. This is the best PR the military has -- it's most honest voice out of the war zone. And it's being silenced."</p>
<p> <a href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/files/army_reg_530_1_updated.pdf">Army Regulation 530--1: Operations Security (OPSEC)</a> (.pdf) restricts more than just blogs, however. Previous editions of the rules asked Army personnel to "consult with their immediate supervisor" before posting a document "that might contain sensitive and/or critical information in a public forum." The new version, in contrast, requires "an OPSEC review prior to publishing" anything -- from "web log (blog) postings" to comments on internet message boards, from resumes to letters home.</p>
