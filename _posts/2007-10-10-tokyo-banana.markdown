I'm now back at work after my trip to Japan for the last couple of
weeks. While I was in Tokyo, I was able to experience the joy which is
the Tokyo Banana. Think of a twinkie-like spongecake (without a shelf
life measured in the lifespan of the planet) with a piece of banana in
the center. That is the Tokyo Banana.

When R and I were waiting at the airport in Tokyo, we found a vender
that sold them. We'd seen them at the train stations but we knew that
there had to be a convenient source because R's co-workers at Six Apart
always brought them back from Japan. Overcome with joy, we bought
several boxes so we could both take them in to work. Now, fortified with
a foreign food product, the Mozilla QA team soldiers on!
