From a thread on a
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/gordonzola/197169.html">Livejournal community</a> where they were discussing bad tattoos (and no, it isn't about a tattoo...):<blockquote><em>and this reminds me of when i used to be a union negotiator, well,
that one time, and the only advice the previous negotiating team gave us was, "if you are going to use the meeting room in the library, make sure you get there first so you can have your back to the painting. let management stare at the painting." it was this painting</em>

This leaves me speechless with awe as a negotiating tactic though, given that this wasn't a bathhouse, one has to wonder about the inspiration for the art. Was this in a union hall?!?
