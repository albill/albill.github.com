I just now found the following reference on a page about Blavatsky's
[plagarism of
sources](http://educate-yourself.org/cn/blavatskyplagiarisms07jul05.shtml):

> "I cannot find a single reference to Chatterji’s glossary in any part
> of the later Glossary. Nearly all of the matter concerning Egyptian
> mythology, etc., in the latter, was copied from Bonwick’s Egyptian
> Belief and Modern Thought. A small part of this was credited, but over
> 100 passages from Bonwick were not credited."
