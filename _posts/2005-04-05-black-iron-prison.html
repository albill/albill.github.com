<P>My wife is sick today. When I was leaving for work, she was watching <B>What Dreams May Come</B> starring Robin Williams. She was feeling underwhelmed by the movie.</P>
<P>It reminded me of a thought that I was having a night or two ago. I've only seen a section of the movie before but it is clear that its vision of the afterlife is one of those Swedenborgian visions where the souls of the dead create their own heaven or hell from their worldview or, in a Buddhist sense, from the karma that they bring with them. It isn't imposed on them but something that they create. People are then able to deal with their issues or traumas and find some sort of peace.</P>
<P>The question that occurred to me is: If this world or life (the one you are in now) is not fair, if there is no true justice in the world, why do you think an afterlife would be any different? If the Stalins, Pinochets, or Kissingers of the world can do the horrific things they do, enjoy the rewards of fucking over and murdering people, and still die peacefully surrounded by friends and family, what would lead you to think that things are ever any different anywhere? That there is some punishment or reward waiting for anyone or, as the movie shows, that there is some glorious afterlife where wrongs are righted and we can finally be at peace?</P>
<P>It seems like a species of wishful thinking and maybe wishful thinking at its worst. The disempowered says "You'll get yours sooner or later and I'll get my just reward" when there is no reason to think so. It's a good way to keep the peasants down, I would say. I'm not sure what they get out of the deal other than the ability to endure their lives.</P>
<P>Now, at least one Buddhist point of view actually seems to agree with the view of the afterlife outlined above in which you cause your own heaven or hell in an afterlife. It's just, there, that this afterlife is a temporary matter and you are burning through the positive or negative dross that you bring with you when you are there. Sure, you can live a virtuous life and be reborn as a demigod or the like but, in the end, you will create enough negative karma to be reborn in a lower realm.</P>
<P>I still don't buy this though. It seems to be yet another mechanism of control for those with power, institutional or otherwise, over those without. "Be good and live a virtuous life and you will be rewarded. Be bad and it is the realm of the hungry ghosts for you."</P>
<P>Fuck 'em. </P>
<P>As conditioned as I am by the controls that we are raised within, I can still tell when they are pounding my square peg into the round hole. I am not interested in embracing the process of the destruction, control, and channeling of my soul in order to not cause disorder for those in charge. I am also not interested in lining anyone up against a wall and shooting them, which is the extreme reaction to the awareness of many of the levels of control placed on us. </P>
<P>There has to be a way out that doesn't involve being draped in chains, being an overseer holding the whip, or in burning it all to the ground. A metaphor that I read once comes to mind:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A group of people are locked into a very large and extensive prison. They live their entire lives in this prison, have children, and otherwise continue their people there. There is no way out of this locked place that they know of. Eventually, some become important in the prison. They get more food than the others. They enforce the rules, get cells with a nicer view, and generally feel important and in charge. They are the top of structure. The important thing to remember, though, is that <I>they are still in the prison with everyone else</I>. They have just accommodated themselves to it and worked the system to their advantage. They haven't escaped the prison.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>That's life in our current civilization in a nutshell. Do you want the gold-plated bars or do you want to be one of the prisoners in the muck and the dark in the dankest part of the prison? Either way, you are inside. What's on the outside? How do you get there?</P>

<p><b>Note based on comments received:</b> Pay attention to the last paragraph. The point of my entry is not based on the idea of: "Oh, fook, we're screeewed!" The prison has been built up, stone by stone, by ourselves to the point where we don't even realize that there is an inside and an outside. We think the prison is the world so I'd just better get with jockeying for a better position since we're all stuck in the shit anyway. There is a way out though....</p>
