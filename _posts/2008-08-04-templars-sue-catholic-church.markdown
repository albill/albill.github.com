One of the modern day Templar orders is suing the Roman Catholic Church in Spanish court in order to get the Pope and the Catholic Church to clear the good name of the Templars (and return billions of dollars of property seized hundreds of years ago). As historians, conspiracy theorists, or Davinci Code fans may recall, the Templars were accused of heresy (or were they?), banned, lost their property, and had their leaders burned at the stake. A number of people still think that Freemasonry may have gotten a kickstart in Scotland by former Templars who did a duck and cover there.

You can <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/2495343/Knights-Templar-heirs-in-legal-battle-with-the-Pope.html">read about today's news</a> at the Telegraph's website:
<blockquote>The Association of the Sovereign Order of the Temple of Christ, whose members claim to be descended from the legendary crusaders, have filed a lawsuit against Benedict XVI calling for him to recognise the seizure of assets worth 100 billion euros (Â£79 billion).

They claim that when the order was dissolved by his predecessor Pope Clement V in 1307, more than 9,000 properties as well as countless pastures, mills and other commercial ventures belonging to the knights were appropriated by the church.

But their motive is not to reclaim damages only to restore the "good name" of the Knights Templar.

"We are not trying to cause the economic collapse of the Roman Catholic Church, but to illustrate to the court the magnitude of the plot against our Order," said a statement issued by the self-proclaimed modern day knights.</blockquote>
The idea of modern Templars getting a <em>Spanish</em> court to give them Catholic assets is so irony filled that it leaves me with the vapors...
