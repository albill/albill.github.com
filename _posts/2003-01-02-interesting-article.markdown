Wow. This is a really cool article. I want to read this fellow's book.
**What Should I Do With My Life? The real meaning of success -- and how
to find it** *by Po Bronson*
[http://www.fastcompany.com/online/66/mylife.html](http://www.fastcompany.com/online/66/mylife.html)
A quote:

> *This is not a new idea. But it may be the most powerfully pressing
> one ever to be disrespected by the corporate world. There are far too
> many smart, educated, talented people operating at quarter speed,
> unsure of their place in the world, contributing far too little to the
> productive engine of modern civilization. There are far too many
> people who look like they have their act together but have yet to make
> an impact. You know who you are. It comes down to a simple gut check:
> You either love what you do or you don't. Period.*

and

> *And this is where the second big insight came in: Your calling isn't
> something you inherently "know," some kind of destiny. Far from it.
> Almost all of the people I interviewed found their calling after great
> difﬁculty. They had made mistakes before getting it right. For
> instance, the catﬁsh farmer used to be an investment banker, the truck
> driver had been an entertainment lawyer, a chef had been an academic,
> and the police ofﬁcer was a Harvard MBA. Everyone discovered latent
> talents that weren't in their skill sets at age 25.*
