I just got back a couple of hours ago from spending the day at a workshop with OTO Bishop Lon Milo Duquette and Constance Duquette (his wife). Both are multiple decade veterans of the OTO and Lon is one of the most experienced bishops within the <a href="http://www.otohq.org/oto/egc.html"><em>Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica</em></a>, the religious side of the OTO. He's also the author of quite a few amusing books (and an object lesson of how to <strong>not</strong> use Abramelin oil...).

The Duquette's were here in town to present their workshop on the <a href="http://www.otohq.org/oto/l15.html">Gnostic Mass</a>. They've been doing this one for years and developing the material over time. It involves a detailed breakdown of EGC history, concepts and then a going through of the mass, literally line by line, explaining or suggestion explanations for symbolism and the magical workings going on. This took about four hours with a couple of breaks. The Duquette's then performed the mass and we all had dinner together.

I found the whole thing rather enlightening (though staying focussed and awake on this stuff for that many hours can be tasking) and I look at the mass in a bit of a new light now. I would recommend their workshop to anyone who gets the chance to attend.
