**3** Keep Matters for a time in suspense. Admiration at their novelty
heightens the value of your achievements. It is both useless and insipid
to play with your cards on the table. If you do not declare yourself
immediately, you arouse expectation, especially when the importance of
your position makes you the object of general attention. Mix a little
mystery with everything, and the very mystery arouses veneration. And
when you explain, do not be too explicit, just as you do not expose your
inmost thoughts in ordinairy conversation. Cautious silence is the
sacred sanctuary of worldly wisdom. A resolution declared is never
highly thought of -- it only leaves room for criticism. And if it
happens to fail, you are doubly unfortunate. Besides, you imitate the
divine way when you inspire people to wonder and watch.
