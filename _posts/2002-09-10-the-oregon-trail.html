So, this last weekend I drove to Oregon and back. It was about 290 miles or so each way plus side trips and the like. Even doing 80 mph for most of it, that's a hell of the long time in the car.

My great-grandmother, Hazel, died on August 20, the day after my birthday. She was 94 years old. She was living in Seattle because her oldest son, Ethan (my maternal grandfather), had moved her here a few years ago after a stroke and the onset of alzheimer's following it. She was still verbal and active but had experienced a progressive decline in memory and her mental ability. This is one of my worst fears of mine when it comes to old age but, anyway... she died peacefully of, effectively, being really old and a bit frail. My daughter was playing with her just six days before her death during a visit.

Hazel's family had a homestead in Summit, Oregon, which isn't too far from Albany on I-5. Hazel's grandfather had settled there from Wisconsin with his family after the Civil War. I have a copy of his Civil War diary, in fact. He and his brother had fought and his brother died of disease. Hazel grew up around Summit and its environs. When she was 13, she had a schoolteacher at their tiny school named "Forest Wayne Beals." Wayne was put up by local families as a schoolteacher, was a World War I veteran and was about 25 or so. Over the next few years, he and Hazel made some kind of connection and it was pretty clear to everyone that they would marry. Her family sent her away for a year to get her away from him and to try to get it out of her system. Hazel didn't forget Wayne and they married when she was 16 in 1924. A bit scandalous for the time, moreso even now, but not illegal then. My grandfather Ethan was their first child and born in 1927 in Alsea.

The family moved to Corvallis in 1944 so my grandfather and brothers would be by Oregon State University there. Hazel lived at home with the children, though she did attend college, and Wayne worked as a postman. She lived there with him until his death in 1972 and on her own in their house until this last decade.

I lose track of the count but I believe that it is three sons, eleven grandchildren, twenty-three great-grandchildren and one great-great-granddaughter (my daughter) from her and Wayne.

She's dead and gone now. I'm not as emotionally touched by it as I would have expected but then she hasn't been all of the way there everytime I've seen her in the last ten years. I hope that my daughter remember her great-great-grandmother though.
