<p>Slept in, got out of bed, went to the bathroom to do morning bathroom things 
that we don&#39;t discuss here. While in bathroom, I heard &quot;drip...drip...drip&quot; from 
floor/wall next to toilet. &lt;insert fun &quot;oh shit&quot; moment less than five minutes 
after waking up&gt; </p>
<p>Stopping self before ripping hole in wall, I pondered whether this was an 
internal or external leak since it was raining. I clambered (without a ladder) 
into the attic crawlspace. There I spied a drip coming from the edge of the wood 
next to the sewage line vent (that all houses have). So, it is an outdoor leak. 
It was dripping every three to five seconds. As the rain sped up, it went to two 
drips every three seconds. </p>
<p>I go to the sewage pipe in my laundry room (directly underneath) and, indeed, 
see some moisture following the pipe down.</p>
<p>I kiss second day of vacation peace goodbye. I wave as it leaves to go see 
someone else.</p>
<p>I called the handyman company that did my exterior repair in June. They are 
going to send a guy out to look at the flashing and the roof there. 
Unfortunately, they are down to one guy (two on vacation, one out with a bad 
tooth) so it will be...next Tuesday.</p>
<p>I call my friend Denny because we were arranging to have coffee or somesuch 
this week. He says &quot;oh ho ho, I&#39;ve had horrible and yet eerily similar problems 
before!&quot; and then proceeds to give me advice. Sum total of advice (beyond how 
much it sucks), get up on the roof, wrap some blue tarp around the leaky spot 
and use lots of ducktape to hold it down and to the pipe.</p>
<p>So, I head off to the store and get duct tape and tarp. I cut the tarp down. 
I then try to borrow a ladder from neighbors. Of course, no one is home on my 
block. &lt;sigh&gt;</p>
<p>I drive off to home depot after looking at website and purchase six foot 
folding ladder. I congratulate myself on being proactive.</p>
<p>Sometime around there, I manage to get first cup of coffee and a sandwhich. 
Oh yes, eating is good.</p>
<p>I come home, go onto back deck and attempt to assault the summit of my home.</p>
<p><b>Note to Self</b>: Roof access requires an eight foot ladder, not a six 
foot one.</p>
<p><b>Second Note to Self</b>: While stationing the ladder on top of the formica 
dining room table does gain necessary height, since ladder is 1/2 inch bigger 
than table, it makes getting off roof much more interesting.</p>
<p>I cut a small hole in a three foot or so square of tarp, pull it over 
outflow, wrap duct tape around it, and then place fist sized rocks around edges 
to hold it down since duct tape doesn&#39;t stick to wet tar paper. Luckily, I 
thought to bring the rocks with me as I can&#39;t seem to find many on the roof.</p>
<p><b>Total Elapsed Time</b>: 4 hours, 22 minutes.</p>
<p>If my vacation keeps being like this, I should fucking go back to my job.</p>
