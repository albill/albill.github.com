R and I went and saw **[Speed
Racer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811080/)** this evening. We both
wanted to see it on the big screen. I've heard mixed reviews of it, with
some people find it too cartoonish or just frenetic. For a movie done by
the Wachowski brothers based on a cartoon, I'm not sure what they were
expecting... I enjoyed it quite a bit and I think R did as well. It has
a simple plot but it is probably the most psychedelic movie, from the
point of few of colors and motion, that I've seen in quite a while. It
is just awesome to behold on a big screen. I enjoyed the look and feel
quite a bit and I found it a worthwhile night out to go see it. Too each
their own. Going to the theater, I did notice the line around it to see
the new Indiana Jones movie but I'm glad that I went and saw this while
I had the chance. Of course, now I have the sound of Big Black's song,
"[Racer X](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-vmMburpMw)," running through
my head constantly... The [first seven
minutes](http://movies.yahoo.com/feature/speedracer.html?showVideo=1) of
the movie are available online, with higher resolution versions on the
site.
