Today, R and I went over to my grandparents' place in order to open some  Christmas gifts with them. My daughter is going out of town on the twenty-third  so we had moved up the gift exchange to accommodate her. R and I will be opening  gifts on the twenty-first as we normally do.

Things went well and we actually had a fairly good garlic chicken pizza from  the Central Market, which is surprising. My grandparents live in a retirement  community so it is usually either not terribly tasty food in their apartment or  the group dining with the near dead in the community dining hall.

I gave Madeline a computer as a gift. She'll be ten years old in March and  they're using Windows machines at her current school. She's been wanting one. I  wanted to have a system that would last her a few years so I built a machine  rather than give her a hand-me-down one. Her system is actually as fast as mine  though I have a lot more RAM, a better video card, and a few extras in mine. Her  system is an AMD 3000+ machine with 512MB of RAM, an 80 gigabyte 7200 RPM drive,  and an ATI card with 128MB of RAM and both digital and analog outputs. It has  5.1 sound on the motherboard and a state of the art internal modem. All told, it  cost me a little over $400 to build from scratch so this was way outside the  range of her normal gifts. I did want her to have a decent system that would  last a while and not simply one that would work for a year or so. I may wind up  paying for an MSN account for her in order to have dial-up access but that may  wait until after her birthday.
