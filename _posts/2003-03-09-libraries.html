So I went and got my University of Washington library card today... They had no record of me in the system so it seems that the gods are smiling on me (or sending me the message that fines go away if you wait long enough...).

I picked up four books which I'll have for two weeks max. I'll probably photocopy three of them (I've photocopied one of them before). The books are <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/075460408X">Iamblichus' <em>De Mysteriis</em>:A manifesto of the miraculous</a></strong> by Emma Clarke (her PhD dissertation), <strong>From Iamblichus to Eurugena: An Investigation of the Prehistory and Evolution of the Pseudo-Dionysian Tradition</strong> by Stephen Gersh, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9004095136/">The City of the Moon God</a></strong> by Tamara Green (the only book on Harran, home of the last Hermeticists), and <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0521651581/">Reading Neoplatonism</a></strong> by Sara Rappe.

The last of these was heavily recommended to me a while ago by my friend, Richard. It looks at Neoplatonism as a contemplative tradition. I expect it to be hard slogging but quite good.
