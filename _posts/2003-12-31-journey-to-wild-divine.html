My copy of <em>The Journey to Wild Divine</em> arrived yesterday. Damn that was quick (compared to the copy of <em>The Hidden God</em> that still hasn't arrived...). <lj user="stonemirror"> and <lj user="abrasax"> have their copies as well. I only did the intro and it was late but it is interesting.</lj></lj>

It has a fairly solid piece of biofeedback hardware that plugs into your USB port: the "lightstone" and three "magic rings." Basically, the magic rings are the sensors. They go over your middle three fingers on your non-use hand. They have small wings that press the back of your fingers so your pads quite comprehensively touch the sensors. They plug go into a cable that has a ps-2 port on the end. That plugs into the Lightstone. The lightstone is solid and plastic and obviously has technical bits inside. It has a fairly standard USB interface (one of the square ones) that you plug it's cable into and the other end goes into your box.

<strong>The Artifact in Question</strong>

I only did the intro so I don't have a lot to say about it. It seems like it has a lot of possibilities. The graphics are good but not super exceptional. I have a nice 3D card (Radeon 9600) for games so I have high standards. Fairly Myst-like in a way.

Ken Schroeder wrote a novel called "<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0765342855/">Permanence</a></strong>" which features a religious sect that is actually fairly agnostic but dedicated to spiritual ideals, practice and the maintenance of a longterm human culture (hence the name of the book). Among other things they do, they use devices to help them develop their meditation abilities and as part of their work. I think there are some possibilities there as long as they are used as a learning aid and not as a crutch to replace actual work. I see these things as teaching aids to help learn to recognize states and to aid them in learning practices.
