He's walking around and stopping when his whiskers encounter something. He still seems to know his way around the house so diagnosis has been difficult. When you wave a finger about a centimeter in front of a cat's eyeball repeatedly, you do get a definite impression that he isn't seeing though.

We've noticed that he's looked a bit like Puss 'n Boots in Shrek 2 recently. By this, I mean that his eyes look very large. I realized today that it is because his pupils seem to be dilated almost all of the way open all of the time. I've only seen them close down a bit when he has faced into direct sunlight. It isn't normal for a cat's eyes to be open to that degree in normal light. That's night vision mode in my experience.

This strikes me as possibly a good reason to take him to the vet. I don't know for sure that this came on suddenly but it seems that way and that could mean that there are other problems.
