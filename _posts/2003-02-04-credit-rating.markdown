I seem to have passed a magical threshold in my credit rating.

Back in the mid-90's, I was married. I separated in 1997 as life changed on us (or I did). In '98, I filed for bankruptcy because we had a daughter and I was paying for two households along with debt that we'd incurred while married.

So, my credit has been shit for years...I bought a new car back in 2001 before Burning Man and then I got a low limit credit card this last year. So, I've been buying things with it and making payments on the car.

Suddenly, just in the last two months, I've started receiving credit card offers after years of <strong>never</strong> getting sent any. First it was one, and then another one. Finally it was two one day and I just got another one today. It seems that I went over some magic number and I'm not enough of a controllable risk to get offered cards again.
