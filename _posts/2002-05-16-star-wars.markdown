Oooh. One of my coworkers (yes, I'm still at work) found out that they are showing Star Wars at 12:01 am not far from where I live and you can buy tickets online. We're trying to organize a rebel assault! I feel dorky now, especially since we're scheduled to go Friday during work but I want to see it now!! Woo hoo! <strong>Update, 3:01 AM:</strong> I will never look at Master Yoda the same again. You have no idea.
