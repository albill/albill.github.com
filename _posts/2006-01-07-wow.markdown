I just got a call from my grandfather in Wyoming. My father is dead. As many of my friends know, my father has been undergoing liver failure over the last year. He was expected to live at least six months or a year and was seeking a transplant. He was in a medical center last weekend because his sodium levels were off but, other than that, nothing was weird. This was in Casper, Wyoming. He told me last weekend, when he got out of the center, he was going to go back home to Denver, rather than continuing on to my grandparents' place like he had planned. He was found this morning in a motel in Cheyenne, which is between Casper and Denver. I assume he stopped for the night. No foul play is suspected. I just spoke to the medical examiner and he won't have test results until Monday but he thinks it could have been my Dad's heart. We're going to have him cremated. My grandfather has offered to drive out (about 120 miles) with his brother to take care of Dad's remains. I'm not sure if I'll do that or not. I'll probably be flying to Denver in the next 24 hours. If anyone has any advice (beyond the emotional, please), I'd love to hear it. I haven't had to deal with the practicalitie of a dead parent before, their estate, etc. Shee-it. I'm a bit stunned at the moment otherwise.
