It took 14 hours of driving in a car crammed to the rafters with all of my stuff (and two wailing cats holding their pee for the whole trip) but I am in Berkeley now.

I arrived at my in-laws an hour ago, brought the cats up, and took a long shower. After the last two weeks, I am beat.

Tomorrow, I take possession of our temporary apartment in Jackson Square in Oakland.
