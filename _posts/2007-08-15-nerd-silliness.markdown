half of the Mozilla Corporation staff is spread out over the entire
planet so we make a point to have gatherings to get everyone together.
This allows us to get face time with people, have people present on
their work, and otherwise work together in person. A certain amount of
silliness seems to come into play at times though. This is the man who

Quite a contrast! :-)
