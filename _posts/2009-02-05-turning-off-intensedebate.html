I've really liked the new threaded plugins that people have developed for Wordpress and other blogs. Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.intensedebate.com">IntenseDebate</a> is just a bit too much of an alpha product. Starting in the last two days, I've literally had hundreds and hundreds of spam comments get past its filters. Since I have to approve a post from someone before they can comment freely, none of you are seeing them but it has made the overhead of running comments here rather burdensome. 

Until IntenseDebate can deal with their problems, I'm turning it off and removing it. Maybe one of their competitors can do a better job.
