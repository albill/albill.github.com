Last week, my team at MobiTV shipped another version of AT&T Broadband
TV, the MobiTV PCTV product. This is an online service that MobiTV makes
available in partnership with AT&T at
[http://att.mobitv.com](http://att.mobitv.com). Getting this version out
the door was a lot of work and a big milestone for my group. I don't
talk about my work much but I wanted to acknowledge that. Here is a
screenshot from the product in "Standard" mode (as opposed to "Guide"
and "Compact" modes). You can see the full size graphic (this is sized a
bit) by clicking on it:
