Last week, my team at MobiTV shipped another version of AT&T Broadband TV, the MobiTV PCTV product. This is an online service that MobiTV makes available in partnership with AT&T at <a href="http://att.mobitv.com">http://att.mobitv.com</a>. Getting this version out the door was a lot of work and a big milestone for my group. I don't talk about my work much but I wanted to acknowledge that. Here is a screenshot from the product in "Standard" mode (as opposed to "Guide" and "Compact" modes). You can see the full size graphic (this is sized a bit) by clicking on it: <p align="center">
