As noted at the [Laughing Squid
blog](http://laughingsquid.com/laughing-squid-decade-2-photoboof-photos/)
today, the pictures from the [Photoboof](http://photoboof.com/) at the
Laughing Squid: Decade 2 party are [finally
up](http://photoboof.com/thephotoboof/squid06/). The Photoboof is a
rather ingenious vehicle (in many senses) for getting people to
misbehave and have fun. I wish that I'd thought of it first! I've
uploaded a few to my [Flickr
account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/) since R and I, as well as
a couple of friends and acquaintances, are in them. I include the one
with the two of us below.
