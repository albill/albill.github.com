My brain is melting.

Maybe I've become the opposite of most students. I have two papers due
by February 11, one for each of my classes. They are 25% or 30% of my
grade depending on the paper.

The one that is 25% is a 3 to 5 (yes, 3 to 5) page paper. I finally read
through my style manual the other day and found out that everything is
double-spaced. My reaction is "WTF?! I can pull three pages out of my
ass. I write e-mail longer than that."

The real problem became clear this evening when I spent about three
hours on the paper (maybe 2 1/2, hard to say). There are introductions
to six sections, we're being asked to:

> In this assignment, you are being asked to show some rudimentary
> understanding of the following issues/problems: freedom/determinism,
> God and religion, morality and society, state and society, mind and
> body, and knowledge and science. In this assignment, you are not
> expected to discuss the issues or comment on any of the reading
> selections; your goal in writing these brief descriptions of the
> problems surrounding the various issues is to show that you understand
> what the issues and problems are. In your essay, try to articulate the
> questions that provoke controversy. You should draw on your reading of
> Nagel, as well as from the introductions in Burr/Goldinger.

Each of the issues/problems is one of the six sections. We were assigned
the introductions, not the actual papers, in each section, and the Nagel
book, which is really supplemental to this.

I've finished my writing for the first three sections, which is half of
the topics. The paper is four pages long (including the required header
at the beginning). I've been told by at least one of my profs that a
page either way is acceptable but going beyond that shows a lack of
rigor. So, if I write the rest of the paper like I've done it so far, it
will be about eight or so page long. ***Ooops.***

So, obviously, I'm doing overkill in some ways. It was worse before. I
tightened up a bunch of my more redundant, flowery phrasing that I
normally use to more concise prose. That reduced it to four pages from
five. :-)

The fear, of course, if that I'll really strip it down and then get
penalized for not covering something well enough. I have a "Am I getting
this write" e-mail to the prof so I'm sure that I'll hear something.

Once this one is done, my history paper is seven pages. I've got a week
and a half and I can turn it in by e-mail so I should be good. I want to
get most of this stuff finished by the weekend.
