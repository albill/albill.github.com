<p>My brain is melting.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#39;ve become the opposite of most students. I have two papers due by 
February 11, one for each of my classes. They are 25% or 30% of my grade 
depending on the paper. </p>
<p>The one that is 25% is a 3 to 5 (yes, 3 to 5) page paper. I finally read 
through my style manual the other day and found out that everything is 
double-spaced. My reaction is &quot;WTF?! I can pull three pages out of my ass. I 
write e-mail longer than that.&quot;</p>
<p>The real problem became clear this evening when I spent about three hours on 
the paper (maybe 2 1/2, hard to say). There are introductions to six sections, 
we&#39;re being asked to:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>In this assignment, you are being asked to show some rudimentary 
	understanding of the following issues/problems: freedom/determinism, God and 
	religion, morality and society, state and society, mind and body, and 
	knowledge and science. In this assignment, you are not expected to discuss 
	the issues or comment on any of the reading selections; your goal in writing 
	these brief descriptions of the problems surrounding the various issues is 
	to show that you understand what the issues and problems are. In your essay, 
	try to articulate the questions that provoke controversy. You should draw on 
	your reading of Nagel, as well as from the introductions in Burr/Goldinger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each of the issues/problems is one of the six sections. We were assigned the 
introductions, not the actual papers, in each section, and the Nagel book, which 
is really supplemental to this.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve finished my writing for the first three sections, which is half of the 
topics. The paper is four pages long (including the required header at the 
beginning). I&#39;ve been told by at least one of my profs that a page either way is 
acceptable but going beyond that shows a lack of rigor. So, if I write the rest 
of the paper like I&#39;ve done it so far, it will be about eight or so page long.
<b><i>Ooops.</i></b></p>
<p>So, obviously, I&#39;m doing overkill in some ways. It was worse before. I 
tightened up a bunch of my more redundant, flowery phrasing that I normally use 
to more concise prose. That reduced it to four pages from five. :-)</p>
<p>The fear, of course, if that I&#39;ll really strip it down and then get penalized 
for not covering something well enough. I have a &quot;Am I getting this write&quot; 
e-mail to the prof so I&#39;m sure that I&#39;ll hear something.</p>
<p>Once this one is done, my history paper is seven pages. I&#39;ve got a week and a 
half and I can turn it in by e-mail so I should be good. I want to get most of 
this stuff finished by the weekend.</p>
