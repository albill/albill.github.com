This is an empty and vacuous post done late in the workday before a three day weekend and a national holiday. I found this video earlier today of "Zen Fighting" and found it amusing. That is all! I must add that only 25 minutes seems to be pretty wimpy. These guys need to go to a decent retreat. <lj-embed></lj-embed>
