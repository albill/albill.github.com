For those that care, I'm "arcanology" on twitter though I most often
tweet about mundane crap. I use it to fill out my Facebook status. If
you're on arcanology.com, I have a tab on the right side with my recent
tweets as well. You know, I used to hate twitter. I kind of like it now
but it is still an amazing time suck if you pay too much attention to
it.
