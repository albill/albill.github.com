The **Down to a Science Cafe** [blog](http://www.sciencecafesf.com/) has
[posted a
follow-up](http://www.sciencecafesf.com/2007/12/03/meditation-cafe-videospics-are-up/)
to the Mindfulness and the Brain presentation that I [posted about last
week](http://www.arcanology.com/2007/11/28/mindfulness-and-the-brain-the-neuroscience-of-meditation/).
They have put up video recordings of the entire presentation by Dr.
Phillippe Goldin, which you can get
[here](http://www.sciencecafesf.com/past-cafes/meditation/). The video
is also broken up into twelve pieces, which have been put up on Youtube
[here](http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=kishorehari). I have the
first one of the twelve embedded below: Dr. Goldin also made a number of
PDFs available of suggested articles. He mentioned during the
presentation that he was going to do this. These are:

-   [Article from *Science*
    Magazine](http://www.sciencecafesf.com/wp-content/uploads/2003Science_BuddhismNeuroscience.pdf)
    on meeting of buddhist monks and neuroscientists
-   [Australian Journal Review
    Paper](http://www.sciencecafesf.com/wp-content/uploads/MelbourneMindfulnessGroup2006AusNewZelandJPsychi_MBSRreview.pdf)
    on Mindfulness Psychotherapies
-   [Overview of
    Mindfulness](http://www.sciencecafesf.com/wp-content/uploads/Shapiro2006JClinPsychol_MechanimsMindfulness.pdf)
    from Journal of Clinical Psychology
-   Short Paper on [Emotion
    Regulation](http://www.sciencecafesf.com/wp-content/uploads/Ochsner2005TICS_cogControlEmotion.pdf)
-   Paper on [Suicide
    Prevention](http://www.sciencecafesf.com/wp-content/uploads/Williams_MBCTsuicidePrevention_JnClinPsych2006.pdf)
    using Mindfulness

I encourage people interested in the current research on meditation
techniques, therapy, and neuroscience (and their intersection) to take a
look at the articles and to watch the video (if you haven't already
heard the podcast). The video has the advantage of showing Dr. Goldin's
slides.
