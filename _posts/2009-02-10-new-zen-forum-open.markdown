As was <a href="http://www.arcanology.com/2009/01/24/rev-nonins-statement-on-his-banning-from-e-sangha/">mentioned recently</a>, Rev. Nonin, a well known Zen teacher, was banned from the E-Sangha web forum recently for not meeting whatever unspecified doctrinal muster is required to have an account on the that site. At that time, Rev. Nonin and others stated that a new online forum for Zen practitioners was in the works since there was no place online that was both open and embracing of the values of the Dharma. I have found out today that this new forum is finally up. It is the <a href="http://www.zenforuminternational.org/">Zen Forum International</a>. I have created an account there (as "arcanology") and plan to participate in the site. With this and the new <a href="http://community.tricycle.com/">Tricycle Community</a> site, this does seem to be the week for new web forums. I encourage all of the Zen practitioners that I know or those interested in Zen to check out the new site and to help build a real community there.
