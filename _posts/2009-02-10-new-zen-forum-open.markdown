As was [mentioned
recently](http://www.arcanology.com/2009/01/24/rev-nonins-statement-on-his-banning-from-e-sangha/),
Rev. Nonin, a well known Zen teacher, was banned from the E-Sangha web
forum recently for not meeting whatever unspecified doctrinal muster is
required to have an account on the that site. At that time, Rev. Nonin
and others stated that a new online forum for Zen practitioners was in
the works since there was no place online that was both open and
embracing of the values of the Dharma. I have found out today that this
new forum is finally up. It is the [Zen Forum
International](http://www.zenforuminternational.org/). I have created an
account there (as "arcanology") and plan to participate in the site.
With this and the new [Tricycle
Community](http://community.tricycle.com/) site, this does seem to be
the week for new web forums. I encourage all of the Zen practitioners
that I know or those interested in Zen to check out the new site and to
help build a real community there.
