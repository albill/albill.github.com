The [24th Chaos Communication
Congress](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Main_Page) (24C3) in
Germany has been over for a couple of days now. This is an annual event
(the 24th, strangely) organized by the [Chaos Computer
Club](http://www.ccc.de/). As their site states:

> The Congress offers lectures and workshops on a multitude of topics
> and attracts a diverse audience of thousands of hackers, scientists,
> artists, and utopians from all around the world. The 24C3s slogan is
> Volldampf voraus! – the German equivalent of “full steam ahead” – a
> particular request for talks and projects featuring forward looking
> hands-on topics.

I've been meaning to go to this event and did consider going to it this
year but it is a very long way away and I did just go to Japan for
vacation a few months ago. The intersection of hacker culture, artists,
and freaks is always an interesting convergence of disparate groups. You
can see the list of
[workshops](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Workshops) or the [daily
schedule](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Fahrplan/) if you want to
see more about what went on there. Luckily, for those of us who were
unable or unwilling to go, many of the presentations at 24C3 were
recorded and these are now available under a [Creative Commons
license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/de/). There
are a lot of options for video here. There is a general [recordings
page](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Conference_Recordings) up which
gives links to video recordings in a variety of formats. The [main
download page](http://chaosradio.ccc.de/24c3_m4v.html) also has an [rss
link](http://chaosradio.ccc.de/24c3_m4v-all.rss) to the video files (for
feed readers) and an [iTunes
link](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=271251344)
is also available. Given the size of these files, I do suggest using the
[torrent links](http://outpost.h3q.com/fnord/24c3-torrents/) for them
instead of getting them directly via http or ftp. In addition to all of
this, there is also [CCC Tube](http://24c3.ccctube.de), which allows you
to stream the content in a Flash-based player. This is my favorite way
of viewing talks out of the choices though all of the talks are not up
yet.

Content from last year (23C3) is also
[available](http://chaosradio.ccc.de/23c3_m4v.html) as well (with
another page
[here](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006-static/static/s/t/r/Streams.html)).
I have watched many of these and, while quality varies, they are quite
interesting.
