Apparantly, my friend, [Scott](http://www.scottstearns.com), feels that
I "had a moment" on Friday with [my
entry](http://www.khephra.org/archives/2005/04/questions_quest.php)
then. His other comment was along the lines of a Keanu Reeves moment,
"Whoa." I'm not sure what that is supposed to mean though he did ask me
if my wife was out that evening.
