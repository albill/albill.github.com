Years ago, back around 1998, I saw a band in Seattle that stuck in my head. This band was called "Numantra." They were an Eastern-influenced act that included an electric sitar. I'm not sure who they opened for but I am pretty sure it was at the Colorbox. That was a now-closed small club in downtown Seattle that showed a lot of small acts. They were probably opening for a local industrial band or Tchkung!, which is why I would have been there.

In any case, they had a CD available at the time but I didn't get it. I was pretty poor at the time and I just didn't feel like it (I guess). A month or so ago, I tracked down the CD on Ebay. I've been quite happy that I found it and it is a pretty good set of music. I just wish there was more of it but I heard they broke up not too long after I saw them.

I just found a circa 1998 music video of one of the songs on the CD, "To Dream Away", this evening. It <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5742823096057256621">is on Google Video</a> and I've added it to this post below. Enjoy!
