I used to LARP when I was about, oh, 17 or so. This was almost 17 years
ago. Somehow, now, I'm glad that I stopped a year or so later.

From [BoingBoing

**D&D re-enactment vid remixed to Bon Jovi tune** \
Boing Boing reader Patrick Grote sez:

![image](http://www.boingboing.net/images/lightningbolt.jpg) Someone
posted [this Stileproject] video clip of adults dressed up and
re-enacting a Dungeons and Dragons melee to our forums, then decided to
remix it in slomo to the tune of Bon Jovi's Blaze of Glory. The result
is fantastically humorous. An homage to all things geek. \
