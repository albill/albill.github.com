Well, and I went to go see <a href="http://www.synthetic.org/a23/">Assemblage 23</a> this evening at the Vogue. They are one of my favorite current goth/industrial bands. I rather enjoyed the show and actually getting to see the artists, etc. etc.

Autumn and I had "the talk" this evening. She's decided that she wants to put our romantic relationship on hold. She&apos;s got a lot of weirdness going on in her life right now which makes it hard for her to deal with a lot of things with other people. Also, she's become good friends with R and I think wants to be free to continue that without feeling conflicted. Then there is the fact that I'm rather distracted with the redevelopment of some sort of relationship with R and that is really acting as a focus for me right now. All of this just makes it easier if Autumn and I are friends (which we both want) but not "involved" at this point. This could always change in the future.

None of this surprised me when she brought it up. I'd had thoughts along similar lines myself but wasn't worrying about things, for once, and just letting things progress naturally in whatever manner they occured. I'm sure it will work out fine in any case.

I'm completely beat at this point. 1:30 am after a day at work and an evening of really loud music and smoking people. Luckily, I have tomorrow off as the division manager decided to have a ski day as a morale event for everyone and to give those of us who don't want to ski (me! me!) the day off. R and I are going to spend the day together before she goes to her evening/night job so this was rather good timing-wise.

Off to bed soon.
