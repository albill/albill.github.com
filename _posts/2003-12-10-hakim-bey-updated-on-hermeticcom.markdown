I added the following to <a href="http://www.hermetic.com">Hermetic.com</a> this evening (per my <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/new.html">What&apos;s New</a> page):

Added
<ul>   <li><a href="http://www.hermetic.com/bey/quantum.html">Quantum Mechanics &amp; Chaos Theory: Anarchist Meditations on N. Herbert&apos;s <i>Quantum Reality: Beyond the New Physics</i></a></li>   <li><a href="http://www.hermetic.com/bey/enzo23-interview.html">Hakim Bey vs. Enzo23: An Interview</a></li>   <li><a href="http://www.hermetic.com/bey/7koran.html">The Holy Koran of The Moorish Science Temple of America</a></li>   <li><a href="http://www.hermetic.com/bey/pw-interview-2.html">Sakhra-l&apos;Assal Interviews Peter Lamborn Wilson</a></li><li><a href="http://www.hermetic.com/bey/sijil-2.html">Sijil of the Fatimid Order</a></li> </ul> to <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/bey/">Hakim Bey and Ontological Anarchy</a> today.

The Circle 7 Koran one was a real bitch too. Each chapter was in a separate file in the version I had to work from... I had to make internal anchors and reformat some.

I need to update the stylesheet for the Bey site. The HTML itself is very vanilla (on purpose).

<b>Updated:</b> I just spent the last hour or two updating all of the HTML and putting in a new stylesheet. Much better...
