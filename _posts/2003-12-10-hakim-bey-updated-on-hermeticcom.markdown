I added the following to [Hermetic.com](http://www.hermetic.com) this
evening (per my [What's New](http://www.hermetic.com/new.html) page):
Added

-   [Quantum Mechanics & Chaos Theory: Anarchist Meditations on N.
    Herbert's *Quantum Reality: Beyond the New
    Physics*](http://www.hermetic.com/bey/quantum.html)
-   [Hakim Bey vs. Enzo23: An
    Interview](http://www.hermetic.com/bey/enzo23-interview.html)
-   [The Holy Koran of The Moorish Science Temple of
    America](http://www.hermetic.com/bey/7koran.html)
-   [Sakhra-l'Assal Interviews Peter Lamborn
    Wilson](http://www.hermetic.com/bey/pw-interview-2.html)

    Order](http://www.hermetic.com/bey/sijil-2.html)

to [Hakim Bey and Ontological Anarchy](http://www.hermetic.com/bey/)
today. The Circle 7 Koran one was a real bitch too. Each chapter was in
a separate file in the version I had to work from... I had to make
internal anchors and reformat some. I need to update the stylesheet for
the Bey site. The HTML itself is very vanilla (on purpose). **Updated:**
I just spent the last hour or two updating all of the HTML and putting
in a new stylesheet. Much better...
