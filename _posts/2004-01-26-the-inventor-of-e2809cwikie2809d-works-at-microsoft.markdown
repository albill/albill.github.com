I have a small Wiki set up for one of the spiritual groups that I work
with and I'm starting to maintain one at my work. They are fairly fun
and I enjoy the group collaboration aspect of it as social software. I
found this at the Seattle PI at

**Microsoft Notebook: Wiki pioneer planted the seed and watched it
grow**

By [TODD BISHOP](mailto:toddbishop@seattlepi.com) SEATTLE
POST-INTELLIGENCER REPORTER To Microsoft's roster of employees, add the
inventor of the wiki. A wiki? Unless you're heavily into the Internet,
chances are you're wondering what the heck that is.

The wiki concept was created by Ward Cunningham, who joined Microsoft
last month after working as a consultant to the company. Cunningham set
out in 1995 to create a unique online site for people involved in
technical aspects of a type of software development known as
object-oriented programming. A wiki is a computer program that lets
people around the world collaborate to create and update Web pages. The
resulting collections of pages are also known as wikis. But there's more
to it than that. Anyone who reads a wiki -- yes, anyone -- can also
easily make changes, corrections and additions, create whole new pages,
and even correct the way the wiki is organized. "It took a while for
this to catch on because it sounded so unusual, but I've now got 25,000
pages about programming up on that site," Cunningham said last week.
