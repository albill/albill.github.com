I found this recently, "<a href="http://www.santafe.edu/~shalizi/cthulhu-hymnal.html">The Cthulhu Hymnal</a>."
<h3>Onward, Cthulhu Cultists</h3>
<em>By <a href="mailto:simon@brithund.demon.co.uk">Simon Barber</a>.  To the tune of ``Onward, Christian Soldiers'':</em>

Onwards, Cthulhu Cultists, just a few more years

Waiting till the Stars Are Right, when he Reappears

Rising from the ocean, striding to the shore

Claiming as his birthright, lands he ruled before

<em>CHORUS:

Onwards Cthulhu Cultists, like in times before

Best get on his good side, or he'll eat us raw!</em>

Great is Lord Cthulhu --- this you ought to know

To get in his good books, while he sleeps below

Imprisoned in Ry'leh, far beneath the waves

Till we liberate him, from his living grave

<em>CHORUS</em>

Think of divine splendour, shaped not unlike Man

But with beard of tentacles --- picture if you can!

Splendid wings of ebon hue, spread beneath the moon

Sleeping down the aeons, dreaming from his tomb

<em>CHORUS</em>

Once he ruled in majesty, in the days of yore

Earth was young and splendid, and His was the Law

Till the jealous Elder Gods, envying his skill

Bound him with their symbols --- but we serve him still!

<em>CHORUS</em>

Soon comes the Millennium, face it without fear

If you love Cthulhu, then your future's clear

Ignore Nostrodamus, skip the Rapture too

Cthulhu is recruiting --- what he wants, is YOU!

<em>CHORUS</em>
