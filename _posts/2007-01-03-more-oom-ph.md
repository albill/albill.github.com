It has been pointed out to me now (almost immediately) that it is "Oom the Omnipotent." I had forgotten that Hugh Urban has mentioned him in both Esoterica and the Journal of the American Academy of Religion.

This reminded me where I first heard of him. I have an original copy, given to me by a friend who never returned my copy of Magee's "Tantra Magick" of one of Oom's newsletter (really a magazine) from his pseudo-masonic "tantric" order. It's a bit beat up but shows the craziness in all its glory.

My thanks to my friends for correcting me.
