Three articles by Michael Ventura of the Austin Chronicle on the effects of Peak Oil. The scenarios he outlines are pretty close to my thinking:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2005-09-30/cols_ventura.html">Things to come: part 1</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2005-10-14/cols_ventura.html">Things to come: part 2</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2005-10-28/cols_ventura.html">Things to come: part 3</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2005-11-11/cols_ventura.html">Things to come: part 4</a></li>
</ul>
Of course, if I was 100% convinced of all of this, I think I'd start working on a different skillset than computer work right now. It is hard to say.
