My neighbor across the street is a single mom with two teens. Her house is the same design as ours from the same development with only minor variations.

This damaged/destroyed a bunch of the siding on that corner (no shit), which amused his mom to no end.

So, I wandered over the night before last and asked her about it. She gave me the name of a local carpenter that she's had do a bunch of work over the last few years. He built a new deck from her original one (and salvaged much of the old to keep costs down), put in a new front door setup for her, some roof work, a fence, and this work on the front. I got in touch with him last night and he's going to come by tomorrow to take a look at the work. He only lives a mile or two away and is at least $30 an hour cheaper than the people we used that one time from the service.

He said that he doesn't worry as much as I do about the work or getting the cheapest guy, etc. but he basically just bites the bullet and pays someone to fix the problem and make it go away.

I'm not rich by any means but I make good money and have some saved up. I decided that rather than being super cheap and having the guy do the minimum, waiting a while, and then doing the minimum in another area, that maybe I should just bite the bullet and have all of the exterior work done at once. (The only exception being the filling of the hole with the old pool.) Sure, it will cost a bunch but then it will, finally, be done, and I can focus on insulating my attic myself and similar fun tasks.
