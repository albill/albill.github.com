This is the game I mentioned the other day...From **Wired** magazine.

Meditate on this: You are the controller. In Journey to Wild Divine, a
new computer game designed with help from a biomedical engineer and an
ex-Tibetan monk, you harness your biofeedback to navigate Myst-like
temples and mountain ranges. To complete each level, you must perform
tasks while managing stress with breathing techniques and mind tricks.
Hardware wired to your fingers monitors your meatware for anxiety. Sound
tough? Get the game ([www.wilddivine.com](http://www.wilddivine.com))
and put your chi to the test. **4 Steps to Enlightenment: How One Player
Fared** **1. Tune In** A sensor on my middle finger monitored my heart,
measuring the time between beats. The readings were charted against a
sine wave; when the durations matched the wave, I was in the zone! The
other finger sensors determined my skin conductivity: The more elevated
my vibe, whetherfrom fear or excitement, the harder my sweat glands
worked, and the higher my juice registered. **2. Game On** Walking down
a path, I came upon a purple globe. A voice told me that it was time to
practice levitating. To lift the globe, I had to get excited. My in-game
guide recommended heavy breathing and laughing out loud. Translation:
Hyperventilate while thinking of car chases and Britney Spears. The
adrenaline junkie in me had that ball spinning off the screen in no
time. Hot damn! **3. Bliss Out** Type-A gamers will find the
energy-boosting tests easy, but try stoking a hearth with deep breaths
and relaxing thoughts - now that's a challenge! I calmly inhaled the
suggested seven-count yoga breath. I thought of grassy fields and happy
puppies. It took 20 minutes, but I got that fire roaring. Then I opened
my eyes, which jacked up my heart rate and snuffed out the flames. **4.
Nirvana** To check my Buddha status, I compared my skills with those of
my in-game guide, Nawang Khechog. In real-life, Khechog studied with the
Dalai Lama in Tibet. The relaxation exercise that took me 20 minutes to
complete? He did it in seconds. Through years of training, his heart
runs coherence patterns constantly, and his skin conductivity is, shall
we say, much lower than normal.
