A wrote recently about a poem that I was trying to remember the title of... I could only vaguely remember the last few lines. It was "Ulysses" by Tennyson that I was trying to remember. The last section is the most lingering in my mind...<blockquote>
          <b>We are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,-- One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.</b>
        </blockquote>
