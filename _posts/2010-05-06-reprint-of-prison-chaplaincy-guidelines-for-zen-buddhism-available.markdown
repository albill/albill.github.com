![image](http://www.engaged-zen.org/Site%20Art/CGangle.jpg)The reprint
of "Prison Chaplaincy Guidelines for Zen Buddhism" from the [Engaged Zen
Foundation](http://www.engaged-zen.org/) is finally available. This is
one of a number of guides for people engaged in prison ministry within
the context of Zen Buddhism and contains quite a bit of practical
information. As it says on the Engaged Zen site:

> Prison Chaplaincy Guidelines for Zen Buddhism: A Sourcebook for Prison
> Chaplains, Administrators, and Security Personnel is intended to
> provide valid information to prisoners, correctional and judicial
> professionals about the practices of Zen Buddhism in prisons and
> jails. Zen is one of many schools in the Buddhist traditions; it is
> not the only one. The information presented here is primarialy about
> Zen but can serve to illustrate, in a general sense, Buddhist practice
> in prison. The example of liturgy and descriptions of monastic
> practices contained herein, however, are representative of a Rinzai
> Zen Buddhist sect and do not necessarily mirror those of other
> Buddhist sects. Terms used throughout this book originated in the
> Sanskrit, Pali, Chinese, and Japanese languages. No attempt has been
> made to provide in-depth definitions of these terms other than their
> usage relative to this text. Buddhism is growing at a phenomenal rate
> in American prisons, and this trend can be expected to continue for
> the foreseeable future. We trust this book will help to foster the
> ability of prisoners to engage in contemplative spiritual practice
> while incarcerated.
