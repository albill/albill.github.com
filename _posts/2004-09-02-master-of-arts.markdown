I filled out an application today for the Master of Arts in Humanities
at [California State University, Dominguez
Hills](http://www.csudh.edu/hux/). This is an accredited MA program at
one of the CSU schools outside of Los Angeles. They've been doing this
for 30 years this year and are part of the California State University
system so accrediting is fairly solid.

This isn't my first choice for a program. I kept hoping the
[Naropa](http://www.naropa.edu) would reinstitute their MA in Buddhist
Studies that they *almost* started a year ago but it doesn't seem like
it is happening. The CSU program is actually relatively cheap ($5K over
a couple of years) and it will have me write a master's thesis on an
approved topic of my choice. I'll end the program with an accredited MA
and a thesis to show for it (along with the education, one supposes).

I was actually accepted to this program back in 1995 when I was only a
couple of years out of the university but life situations caused me to
decide to wait to start taking classes at that time. That was within a
year of my getting into the tech industry and getting married for the
first time.

I'm still trying to figure out a good way to learn at least basic
Tibetan as well but it looks like self-teaching might be the only real
option. With the full-time job that I have and an MA program along with
getting married and having my daughter, I might be full up on stuff for
a couple of years. With any luck and some work, I'll be done with my
degree in about two years if I work at it a bit.

Assuming that I get accepted, I'll start classes in January. Since this
is a distance program, it's mostly reading and writing papers, which I
was always fairly good at so I'm not worried about doing that end of it
at all. It's more a matter of keeping focus over the next year or two.

I have some ideas for thesis topics within History or Philosophy
relating to Western Esotericism so it should be interesting.
