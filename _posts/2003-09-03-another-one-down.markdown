I just found out that a casual acquaintance of mine is dead. No sympathy
is required. We weren't close. We mostly interacted on the Church of Mez
list locally. I hadn't heard that he'd been having problems so this is a
pretty big surprise. His online sucide note and such is the weirdest
thing I've seen in a while though.
