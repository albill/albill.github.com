The new term for school has started. This is the term in which I am to
write the bulk of my Master's thesis. Given that I still don't know who
two of the three members of my thesis committee are, we may be off to a
slow start. In the meantime, I've picked up my texts again (after a nice
break for the last two months) and am working through material. I don't
expect that the thesis will be terribly difficult to write though it
won't be easy either. It is simply a lot of text and I needed to
construct the outline I created last term in order to be able to tackle
it. In a lot of ways, I'm looking forward to being done with it far more
than I am the act of creating it. I'm as educated now as I will be when
I am done so, in a sense, this is paperwork to validate my degree. That
said, I will have a text when I am finished and I can quit thinking
about Western Esotericism for while when it is done. I have other
Buddhist materials that I need to cover for my personal work and
development, as well as working on my skills at Python and other geek
related areas. Getting the MA finished after two years of work will
clear my plate a bit.
