We just got back from our trip to Seattle. We spent the weekend visiting friends and I attended the events for the Karmapa while I was there. I'll be writing more about it later. For now, I will leave people with these two pictures from inside of <a href="http://www.travelersteaco.com/">Travelers</a>, a store on Capitol Hill, run by longtime members of the pagan community. They sell all sorts of goods from India, for the most part, and relatively recently expanded to selling a lot of food items. They have always had a beautiful space though. <p align="center">
