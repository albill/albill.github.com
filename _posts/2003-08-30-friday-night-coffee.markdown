I was going to bail from work early with it being a three day weekend
and all but I started talkign to Dianthus in e-mail at work. She just
started working on campus again this last week. In any case, it seemed
like a good excuse to get coffee since we haven't chatted much in the
last few months outside of my BBQ the other week. She jetted over while
I whacked on the demo Xbox unit in the lobby. We have these stand-up
Xbox and monitor units that they use at malls there. We then piled into
my car and hauled ass down to....**the mall!!** Ah. Brings back the
memories of days of yore except she and I would probably have just gone
to the Denny's nearby in those times. We hung out, chatted about this or
that, especially her fascination for Henry Kissinger and the nasty porn
story she wrote featuring him (therapy time for you!!!) and then we were
required to hit the Half Price Books looking for deals. She got a book
on Curse Tablets and some fiction. I got **Shadow of the Hegemon** since
I hadn't read it yet. Then we wandered the mall for a bit and got
Russian food. My exciting Friday night! ;-)
