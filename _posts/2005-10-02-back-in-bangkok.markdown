R and I are back in Bangkok now staying at the China Princess. We went to the Weekend Market (JJ) last night. This morning, we went to the Grand Palace and saw the Emerald Buddha... The National Museum turned out to be closed though.

Tomorrow, we are taking a bus trip up north to the ruins of the old Thai capitol. That should be fun.

More later.
