<p>R and I hosted the local OTO's movie night this last Friday evening. We watched part of a lecture series on Ancient Egypt.</p><p>R made bread pudding and we had some chips and wine as well. Other people brought over muffins, beer, and various other food or alcohol substances.&nbsp;</p><p>Other than watching the videos, people spent a bit of time hanging out and chatting as well. R and I chatted a bit with a couple of non-OTO members who are interested in the order.</p><p>Saturday, we went to the birthday party for a sister in the order and ran into many of the same people. It seems to have been a fairly social weekend.</p><p>Beyond all of this, my friend, Richard, came over on Saturday afternoon and we did the third class in his series of elemental workings. As I've mentioned before, these are, in a limited sense, kind of a Western Esoteric chi-gung. This weekend we did the <strong>The Work of Water</strong>. All of these exercises are primarily somatic and not visual or intellectual so explaining them too much seems to get in the way. In a primary way, they are about getting in touch with aspects of your physical form and its interaction with the environment. It was all very interesting. We have one more to do after this and we're done with this series. <br /></p>
