I just turned in my final paper for my independent study in Western
Esotericism at CSU, Dominguez Hills. It came out to a bit over eleven
pages and I wrote it today and yesterday (as mentioned last night when I
was working on it). R proofed it for me this afternoon, I made some
changes and turned it in. That means that I am **done, done, done** with
this class. I'm not done with that topic since my Master's thesis will
be in that area but I am done with it until September unless I do some
more work on my own in the meantime. I have this week and the next to
finish my reading and do the writing on the research paper for my class
on the Greek Polis and Philosophy. After this I'll have a couple of
weeks without class and the class on Rousseau, his philosophy, and the
period around it will start. That is the only class that I am taking for
the Summer trimester and my last full class in the program. Other than
that, I will have only a single one credit class to take which is
creating the works cited list and some other initial work on my thesis.
I still have to do the writing necessary for my advancement to candidacy
but it should be fairly simple. Unfortunately, the work on my thesis,
getting it read by the three professors, and then revised (and then
repeat) will probably take at least six months. This means that it will
probably be a year until my thesis is complete and it isn't clear how
long it will take to actually be awarded my degree after that. I have
heard stories about red tape, timetables, and process on the part of the
university. After that, I'll have to consider if I ever want to go near
a PhD program and writing some of the books that I've mentioned before.
My mentor would really like me to write a few articles within Western
Esotericism and get them published to help build up a curriculum vitae
as well.
