While testing a Firefox security release, I have to go through a series
of testing of search plugins and the like to verify that things are
still working correctly. One tends to enter random things when doing
testing of this sort (or goes mad from tedium) so I searched on my name
on [a9.com](http://www.a9.com). I was surprised to see that [the
results](http://a9.com/%22Al%20Billings%22) included mentions of my name
in books on Amazon. Apparently, my review of the novel,
[Multireal](http://www.amazon.com/gp/sitbv3/reader?asin=1578633966&pageID=S00H&checkSum=Z1cDG5JU63RDML9L9kQKBlUytXI4ngITmn3IKeKh2rY=)
(or more likely, its precursor, Infospace), by David Edelman made it
into the quotes in the book as can be seen
[here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1591026474/ref=A9/?_encoding=UTF8&keywords=%22Al%20Billings%22&p=S00A&checkSum=Z1cDG5JU63TzgEWCKAHlFoK0oPwE9q1uZ2lWMnvli18=).
Additionally, my friend Jason Miller [acknowledged
me](http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1564148793/ref=A9/?_encoding=UTF8&keywords=%22Al%20Billings%22&p=S008&checkSum=Z1cDG5JU63QcKHYKflbeE1zBpc/wALt7MrFUYWJsWqU=)
in his
[book](http://www.amazon.com/Protection-Reversal-Magick-Witchs-Defense/dp/1564148793/)
on sorcery and Mark Stavish
[mentioned](http://www.amazon.com/gp/sitbv3/reader?asin=1578633966&pageID=S00H&checkSum=Z1cDG5JU63RDML9L9kQKBlUytXI4ngITmn3IKeKh2rY=)
the zine I used to publish in his
[book](http://www.amazon.com/Between-Gates-Dreaming-Projection-Esotericism/dp/1578633966/ref=si3_rdr_bb_product)
on Lucid Dream and Astral Projection. The most random one is an
[acknowledgment](http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1438203829/ref=A9/?_encoding=UTF8&keywords=%22Al%20Billings%22&p=S032&checkSum=ROpQRGiivAjzqi951wpT6pVX7F+IM2PFqfCiik5n+zQ=)
of me using one of my ancient nicknames alongside my name in a book on
the
[Necronomicon](w.amazon.com/Necronomicon-Everything-Never-Wanted-Know/dp/1438203829/)
in the introduction.
