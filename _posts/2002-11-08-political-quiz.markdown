I took a political quiz this evening. I don't feel it is entirely accurate. I disagree with the basis of quite a few of the questions. My anarchosyndicalist leanings combined with Daniel Quinn meme infestation don't seem to be truly represented. Here is it for what it is worth: <font size="+1"><strong>Your political compass</strong></font> <strong>Economic Left/Right: -2.38 Authoritarian/Libertarian: -8.10</strong> <img src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/axeswithnames.gif" border="1" height="500" width="500" /> You can take the <a href="http://politicalcompass.org/">Political Compass Test</a> too.
