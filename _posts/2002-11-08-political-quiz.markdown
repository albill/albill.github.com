I took a political quiz this evening. I don't feel it is entirely
accurate. I disagree with the basis of quite a few of the questions. My
anarchosyndicalist leanings combined with Daniel Quinn meme infestation
don't seem to be truly represented. Here is it for what it is worth:
**Your political compass** **Economic Left/Right: -2.38
Authoritarian/Libertarian: -8.10**

take the [Political Compass Test](http://politicalcompass.org/) too.
