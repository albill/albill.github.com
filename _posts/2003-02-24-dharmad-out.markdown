Alright, I've had enough rides on the Mandala Merry-go-round for at
least a week or three. I have now received my first root tantra
empowerment. As a special bonus, I received a test transmission of a
Shitro practice with the instructions that I (and anyone else there) can
do it if we wish. (There is quite a Shitro practice group that meets
locally with a lot of overlap.) I've spent about 20 or so hours sitting
in about two feet by two feet of space on a nice meditation cushion. If
I wasn't a Westerner raised with chairs, my hips would probably feel a
lot better right now. ;-) All in all, it went quite well and I'm quite
happy for the experience of taking it. Kilung Rinpoche is a good lama
and it was a good group of people. I just found out that the monks
visiting to do the Sand Mandala over the next week and a half at the
Asian Art Museum are sponsoring a series of empowerments this week:

-   Monday - Lion-faced Chenrezei (?? Never heard of this Chenrezei)
-   Wednesday - White Zambhala
-   Friday - 21 Tara

I may go Friday. I'd consider tomorrow if I'd had an evening with R
since Wednesday...
