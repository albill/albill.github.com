Yesterday, R and I went to a meeting with the Wiccan High Priestess that we are working with after work. As non-initiates of this particular tradition's line, we can't participate in "their" version of a Full Moon ritual since it is only disclosed to initiates of that tradition. Since the HPS is trying to organize a teaching group, she wanted to get together with us so we could create
an "outer" Full Moon ritual that wasn't oathbound material. This will give us a ritual format for the group to use on an ongoing basis. We worked on this with her and chatted for about two hours and then took off for home...

Later on, I finished the new Will McCarthy novel, <strong>Lost in Transmission</strong>, which is the third book following <strong>Collapsium</strong> and <strong>The Wellstone</strong>. There is obviously a fourth book in store as well as the overall story arc isn't finished. I enjoy his books overall and he's very creative but I do sometimes wish the books were a bit more self-contained. In any case, it's a good read. I'm going to be reading Robert Adams' <strong>Stone</strong> next, I think.

Tonight, R and I read the first chapter of the <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/engccxx.html">Book of the Law</a> together. Today is the anniversary date of the reception of the first Chapter (one per day). It also happens to be the 100th anniversary of the original reception in 1904 so it was good to spend some time with the text. Madeline is coming over tomorrow or we would be going to one of two celebrations for the
100th anniversary's second day that we have been invited to. Howling Thelemites might be a bit much for my daughter though. Saturday, for the third and final day, we are going to an event at Horizon Oasis, O.T.O., and having dinner there. I think we're both looking forward to a nice event.
<blockquote><em>But to love me is better than all things: if under the night stars in the desert thou presently burnest mine incense before me, invoking me with a pure heart, and the Serpent flame therein, thou shalt come a little to lie in my bosom. For one kiss wilt thou then be willing to give all; but whoso gives one particle of dust shall lose all in that hour. Ye shall gather goods and store of women and spices; ye shall wear rich jewels; ye shall exceed the nations of the earth in spendour &amp; pride; but always in the love of me, and so shall ye come to my joy. I charge you earnestly to come before me in a single robe, and covered with a rich headdress. I love you! I yearn to you! Pale or purple, veiled or voluptuous, I who am all pleasure and purple, and drunkenness of the innermost sense, desire you. Put on the wings, and arouse the coiled splendour within you: come unto me!</em>

<em>At all my meetings with you shall the priestess say -- and her eyes shall burn with desire as she stands bare and rejoicing in my secret temple -- To me! To me! calling forth the flame of the hearts of all in her love-chant.</em>

<em>Sing the rapturous love-song unto me! Burn to me perfumes! Wear to me jewels! Drink to me, for I love you! I love you!</em>

<em>I am the blue-lidded daughter of Sunset; I am the naked brilliance of the voluptuous night-sky.</em>

<em>To me! To me! </em></blockquote>
I spent a good chunk of this evening finishing a Namkhai Norbu book that I've been reading. A friend of mine sent me a PDF scan of a short article on Norbu's Yantra Yoga today so I exported it to tiff files this evening, ran it through Omnipage Pro, and then converted the text result to clean HTML. So much more portable! (I do things like this all of the time.)
