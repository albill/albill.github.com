The podcast, Skeptiko, has an excellent interview with B. Alan Wallace today.

Wallace is one of those Buddhist figures to whom I pay a lot of attention. He was a monk for 14 years (ordained by the Dalai Lama) and a well known translator. At the age of 34, he went back to school at Amherst to finally finish his undergraduate degree, which he had left. He then went on to Stanford and received a PhD in Religious Studies there.

Among various projects, he's running the Shamatha Project, which is trying to gather data in a scientific manner on meditation by leading groups of people through shamatha meditation in controlled groups.
