<p>This was sent to me by a friend of mine in exchange for the other song that I posted.</p>
<p>From the Shangpa <strong>Timeless Rapture- Inspired Verses of the Shangpa Masters</strong>, p.103- Songs of Kyergangpa- from the "vajra song that introduces one's own mind as the spiritual master"....</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I were to relate his life story, it would be like this:</p>

<p>This master is not subject to distance, there is no sentient being he does not pervade.</p>
<p>Because his aspirations are pure, there is no one who does not belong to his family</p>
<p>Because his compassion is vast, there is no one he has not placed in enlightenment's primordial state.</p>
<p>Because this maser's acts are powerful, he enters both existence and transcendence with complete mastery.</p>
<p>Because this master is not subject to change, you might have wrong views about him but he remains the same.</p>
<p>You've never been separated from this master for an instant. Such a longtime companion, but so difficult to see!</p>
<p>Because this master is not subject to death, he keeps constant vigil: how amazing!</p>
<p>As for such a spiritual master of your own mind,<br>Look to his face and recognize your own nature.<br>Pray to him without doubt or hesitation.<br>Develop devotion to him by placing your mind in it's own uncontrived ground.<br>Serve him by dwelling continually within it.<br>Feed him the food of clarity and emptiness without grasping.<br>Offer him the drink of the realization of inseparable mindfulness and&nbsp; distraction.<br>Clothe him in the robe of knowledge of appearance and sound as magical illusion.<br>Place below him the carpet of uncontaminated bliss.<br>Have him wear the hat of unsought primordial presence.<br>Offer him the gifts of no clinging to whatever arises.</p></blockquote>
