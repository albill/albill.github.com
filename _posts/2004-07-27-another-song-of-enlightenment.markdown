This was sent to me by a friend of mine in exchange for the other song
that I posted.

From the Shangpa **Timeless Rapture- Inspired Verses of the Shangpa
Masters**, p.103- Songs of Kyergangpa- from the "vajra song that
introduces one's own mind as the spiritual master"....

> If I were to relate his life story, it would be like this:
>
> This master is not subject to distance, there is no sentient being he
> does not pervade.
>
> Because his aspirations are pure, there is no one who does not belong
> to his family
>
> Because his compassion is vast, there is no one he has not placed in
> enlightenment's primordial state.
>
> Because this maser's acts are powerful, he enters both existence and
> transcendence with complete mastery.
>
> Because this master is not subject to change, you might have wrong
> views about him but he remains the same.
>
> You've never been separated from this master for an instant. Such a
> longtime companion, but so difficult to see!
>
> Because this master is not subject to death, he keeps constant vigil:
> how amazing!
>
> As for such a spiritual master of your own mind,\
> Look to his face and recognize your own nature.\
> Pray to him without doubt or hesitation.\
> Develop devotion to him by placing your mind in it's own uncontrived
> ground.\
> Serve him by dwelling continually within it.\
> Feed him the food of clarity and emptiness without grasping.\
> Offer him the drink of the realization of inseparable mindfulness and
> distraction.\
> Clothe him in the robe of knowledge of appearance and sound as magical
> illusion.\
> Place below him the carpet of uncontaminated bliss.\
> Have him wear the hat of unsought primordial presence.\
> Offer him the gifts of no clinging to whatever arises.
