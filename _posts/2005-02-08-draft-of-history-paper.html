<p>I just finished what I&#39;ve marked as &quot;Draft 5&quot; of my History 501 paper. After 
my frustration with the Philosophy 505 paper experiences (and I regret turning 
it in early now), I am determined to get the history paper right. It is a seven 
page paper so it shouldn&#39;t be too bad.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been working on it off and on since this weekend, doing about a third of 
it on Saturday and then hammering out a full draft on Sunday. I then went back 
over it a few times. Last night, I asked R to read it for errors and she agreed 
so I printed it out. Tonight, she went through it, found a bunch of the kind of 
typos that spellcheckers don&#39;t catch and quite a few places where my language 
was too longwinded or I had sentences with too many clauses for comfort. I wound 
up getting a little sharp during the connection process, which is bad since 
she&#39;s doing me a favor. I apologized but I do value having someone literate 
enough to proofread at home as I am going to be writing, on average, three or 
four papers a class.</p>
<p>I went back and rearranged entire sections to flow more logically. The paper 
is set up to answer three separate questions from an introductory text on the 
study of history that we read. My paper answered those questions but linking 
them up into an overall theme was difficult. R had some ideas there and I 
pondered them a while. Eventually, I think I created something that flows 
better. I&#39;ll print out Draft 5 tomorrow and go over it. I&#39;d like to turn it in 
by Wednesday since it is due by Friday. Luckily, the prof prefers papers by 
e-mail.</p>
