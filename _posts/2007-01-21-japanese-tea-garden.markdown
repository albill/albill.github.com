Along with visiting the Asian Art Museum yesterday, R and I also went to Golden Gate Park to visit the Japanese Tea Garden there. R had never been there even though she grew up in the area and I'd been wanting to visit it since we moved here. It was actually a bit smaller than I imagined (though Golden Gate Park is miles long) but it was fairly well done as a little spot to visit. I put up pictures from this visit as well in a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157594492874448/">set</a> at Flickr. A couple are below. <p align="center">
