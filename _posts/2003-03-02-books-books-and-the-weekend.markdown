Today was a nice, calm weekend day for a change...

I got to sleep in a little while R went off to her study group. Madeline came over to see her papa in the late morning and we cuddled on the couch for a few hours watching cartoons and playing. We spoke about her bithday (on the 22nd) and what she wanted and I explained to her why there was no ferret here anymore. I wound up having to explain cremation to a six year old (no one apparantly had) and I showed her Doodle's ashes, which are in a nice wooden box on the mantle now. Eventually, I took her home so she and her mother could go visit my dad, who is currently here in town living in his house (rather than in the Rockies).

After dropping her off, R and I went over to Third Place Books since it is near Madeline's home and browsed around a bit. I ran into  and her friendly husband there, which is funny since she keeps running into people there (like ) even though none of us live around there at this point.

<em>(Actually, I'm being snarky here since Redegg's husband seems to harbor an intense dislike for me. I don't know the specifics as to why but I can guess the general issues since we all used to live together...He didn't do more than vaguely look in my direction which is probably best for both of us.)</em>

I picked up a copy of Ken Wilber's recent <strong>A Theory of Everything</strong> and R.J. Stewart's new book, <strong>The Miracle Tree</strong>, on qabalah. The R.J. Stewart book actually looks fairly good and practical. It seems to be mostly a book on technique ("what if all of your books burned up tomorrow?") rather than simple theory. People forget, with his normal Celtic trip, that he was a student of Gareth Knight for a lot of years and knows his more standard Hermetic magic related stuff.

On the way home, R and I decided to stop by Trader Joe's as it is one of the few places to get low-carb candy and sugar-additive free Chicken for a good price. Since Half-Price Books is a block away, we had to stop there too... I picked up a copy of <strong>The Pope and the Heretic</strong> on Giordano Bruno there. That's actually been on my Amazon wish-list for a while so I was glad to see it there.

On the way back from there, we also picked up rentals of <strong>My Big Fat Greek Wedding</strong> and <strong>River's Edge</strong> (which I'd never seen). We watched the latter this evening too. "Friends don't tell on friends!!"

Charly came over and she and I went through all of the photos from one of the last <a href="http://www.cabiri.org">Cabiri</a> shows for inclusion in a picture gallery on the website. I had a gigabyte of photos so I needed someone other than me to pick which ones we actually wanted up. That went fairly well and she eventually wandered home and we watched our show.

Now it's 12:30 AM and I'm sitting here drinking coffee... Probably not a good sign. I'm cleaning up my MP3 library a bit though so that's all well and good. ;-)
