Jeff Vandermeer, a fairly interesting author, has a blog. I just found
this out. Cool.
[http://vanderworld.blogspot.com/](http://vanderworld.blogspot.com/)
From his things to say to his 16 year old self if he had the chance:

> (9) There's going to be a really bad typo in your swords-and-sorcery
> story in the school literary magazine ("the musty smell of countless
> ages" without the "o" in "countless"). Don't sweat it. These things
> happen. Maybe it was intentional by the typesetter, maybe not. But
> you'll never be able to prove it.
