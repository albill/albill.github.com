My weekend is just about over but it was nice having Friday off and such.

Yesterday, I attended a <a href="http://www.pemakilaya.org/calendar/printable.php?Calendar=rootcalendar&amp;DateID=10/4/2003&amp;Repeatid=JD4HEqPlGsbKJuec9HJ8plSpg">teaching and empowerment for the 21 Taras</a> with <a href="http://www.pemakilaya.org/rinpoche/bio.php">Kilung Rinpoche</a>.  This event was hosted by <a href="http://www.pemakilaya.org">Pema Kilya</a>, the local Buddhist group that I've been doing things with on occasion.

The event was fairly long (from 1:00 to 6:00 pm) and included a practice of the 21 Taras at the end of it. I'm glad that I want and I got a bit out of it but I still feel a bit at odds when I go to stereotypical Buddhist events like this. I felt a lot more home with Namkhai Norbu's <strong>Dzogchen Community</strong> really. Being surrounded by devout Buddhists hanging on the every word of a man who is the same age as me is a little weird sometimes. I respect Kilung Rinpoche's learning, dedication to practice and knowledge of tradition. He is a good teacher and knows his stuff but he is still just a man after all. I guess I'm a little to antinomial to always feel comfortable within the strictures of orthodoxy, especially when surrounded by people who seem to love it without question. It just looks like blind faith to me.

It's also a little weird to be one of four men in the room and one of two under 50. Tibetan Buddhism really is full of middle-aged women mostly.

I'm working through my copy of Emma Clarke's <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/075460408X/qid=1065417992">Iamblichus' Mysteriis-A manifesto of the miraculous</a></strong> right now. Other than that, I'm trying to spend some time going over material relating to the Corpus Hermeticum, Hekate, and the Chaldean Oracles. I'm trying to get some better grounding and understanding of these traditional materials as part of my process of working with them for ritual work. <lj user="paradoxosalpha">'s paraphrasing of some of the material from <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/texts/hermetica/hermes13.html">Corpus Hermeticum, Book XIII</a> has been cool as well.</lj>

After the empowerment and teachings yesterday, R and I watched <strong>Terminator 2</strong>, which I hadn't seen in years. It was a nice way to unwind after her dad was here for the week. We finally had the house just to ourselves for the first time in a week.

Today, I got up late and bummed around, eventually cooking us breakfast before we went off to the fabric store. I purchased some satin cloth on sale ($2.50 a yard!) for altar cloth for the Ogdoadic work (red, black and white) and a yard of Chinese silk brocade which was nice and blue. This is for our upstairs altar in the living room. Currently, Thoth resides on this altar and, no, he isn't Chinese but the cloth was quite pretty to look at. I wanted to have a nice looking altar cloth for an altar that sits at the top of the stairs from our front door.

We also picked up some pumpkins of various sizes and I picked up Madeline later in the day from her mother's place. We spent the early evening carving pumpkins, eating pizza, and watching <strong>Monsters Inc.</strong>, which all of us really love. It was a nice evening and I only took Madeline home a short while ago.
