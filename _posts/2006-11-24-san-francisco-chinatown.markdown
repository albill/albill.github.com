My mother and daughter had never been to the Chinatown in San Francisco
so we spent the day out there and also paid a visit to Japantown. We did
the normal tourist walk up and down the street there. We also paid a
visit to the Norras Temple. The Norras Temple is the oldest Buddhist
temple in California and it claims to be the oldest one in the United
States. Outside, it is a rather plain building:

But if you climb up the steps to the third floor, you will find a rather
nice, small temple. The staff there, older Chinese fellows hanging out,
were very friendly and left us free to look around respectfully.

This is the main shrine.

This is a closeup. I was surprised to see a lot of Tibetan (Vajrayana)
statuary and iconography in the room but it was very present. The entire
space, both decent sized rooms, was covered in imagery and every
horizontal surface had fresh offerings as you see above.
