<p>Someone that I know on the local <b>Church of Mez</b> list posted this item:</p>
<p>This, from Pearl E Gates, the guy who runs the Gate at Burning Man each year. 
He&#39;s over there instructing SCUBA. Please, if you can- send him a couple bucks? 
I&#39;m counting my blessings. Might want a kleenex here:
<p>
Sitting around, day after Christmas, just staring at the TV – some movie we&#39;ve 
seen before. Mid-morning, post-breakfast stupor controlling Karin and me. The 
power flickers and we moan. We&#39;ll have to get up and do something? Then we hear 
some yelling outside. I look out the front door, still puffed up with pride 
about our new house, just 400 feet back from the beach. People are running up 
our street yelling. It looks like a fire at the large two story resort that 
effectively blocks our view of the beach. Smoke and dust coming up and all these 
people. Then a small line of really brown water comes rolling towards us. That&#39;s&nbsp; 
weird. But I reckon it must be some strange full moon high tide. So we go 
upstairs so we don&#39;t get wet.</p>
<p>I look out the window and try and take some pictures. There is a quiet rumble 
to it, like those white noise generators that are supposed to help you sleep. 
The water is getting higher and higher and then it destroys our friends cement 
bungalow! Then our front door caves in, and then water is coming up the stairs! 
HOLY SHIT. This was the last point my brain worked for a long time.</p>
<p>We try and throw a mattress out the window to float on, but the water is 
rising too fast, and out the window we climb. It&#39;s all going so fast. It&#39;s 
faster than conscious thought and by the time we are on our second story roof, 
the water is coming out the window. We jump.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Karin doesn&#39;t jump at the same time or did I jump too early? We&#39;re separated. 
I scream her name, but the crashing roiling water mutes me. I can&#39;t hear her. I 
scream and scream until I get hit by something and pulled under. I can&#39;t swim to 
the top, I pull myself through trash and wood to the surface and off I go. Ahead 
are trees wrapped in flotsam and as I look a Thai guy is struggling to get free 
of it, as I pass by at 30 MPH I realize he is impaled on a piece of wood and 
can&#39;t even scream.</p>
<p>My brain shut down when Karin disappeared, and now all I can do is survive.</p>
<p>Something triggers and I swim. I swim to avoid the trees which will trap me, 
possibly kill me. It seems that I am atop the crest of the tsunami, whichis less 
like a wave than a flood.</p>
<p>From on high I can see the water hit buildings, then rise, then watch the 
buildings collapse into piles of concrete and rebar. I swim to avoid these. Left 
and right I paddle, looking ahead the whole time trying to figure the hazards. 
None of this is conscious, this isn&#39;t me thinking it out, it&#39;s some recessed 
part of the brain coming out and taking control. I was busy seeing the weird 
things, like massive diesel trucks being rolled end over end. Or the car 
launched through the 2nd storey wall of a former luggage shop. Or the person 
high up in a standing tree in a lurid orange thong. Or the older foreigner that 
got stuck in the wood and steel wrapped around a tree, and then his body torn 
off while his head remained. I couldn&#39;t scream.</p>
<p>I was pulled under, my pants caught on something, I decided that this was 
neither the place nor time for me to die, and ripped my pants off. I surfaced 
into a hunk of wood which cut my forehead.</p>
<p>A 5 gallon water bottle sped by, and I wrapped myself around it like a horny 
German Shepard on a Chihuahua. I was passing people with bleeding faces and 
caked in refuse. Some people reached out to me, and I back, but the water was 
too fast and erratic. Some people screamed for help and I told them to swim. 
Some people just stared with empty eyes, watching what happened, but seeing 
nothing. Some were just floating bodies.</p>
<p>At some point, I passed a guy, cut on his cheek, holding onto big piece of 
foam. We just made eye contact and shrugged apathetically at each other. Then I 
turned ahead to watch fate. When I looked back he was gone. Trees were pulled 
down, and their flotsam added to the flow. I was hit by a refrigerator and 
pushed towards a building that was collapsing. I swam and swam and swam and swam 
and still was pushed right towards a huge clump of jagged sticks and metal. I 
was pulled under, kicked towards the mass, cut my feet and kicked again. I 
popped up on the other side, spun around and pulled under again.</p>
<p>Down there, I knew it was not the time, and I pulled my way up through the 
floating rubbish of my former town. I pulled and pulled and my lungs ached for 
air. I flashed on Star Wars, the trash compactor scene, and had some big grin in 
the back of head as I popped up. Sucking shitty water and air deep in my lungs.</p>
<p>This went on for weeks. Time simply left the area alone. I grabbed the edge 
of a mattress and floated. Breathing, just breathing. Awareness brought back by 
the sound and look of a water fall. Trying to push up onto the mattress more and 
more, and it took my weight less and less. Tumbling over the edge, sucked under 
again, and out I shot, swirled into a coconut grove, where the water seemed to 
have stopped. There was even a dyke like wall around the grove.</p>
<p>The water spun and churned, but went no where, and got no higher. It wasn&#39;t 
swimming, or climbing, but something in between. I made my way to the land. 
Every step had to be careful with broken glass everywhere, and sheet metal 
poking out. It was a long slow struggle. The low rumble had stopped, and now is 
the occasional creak of wood on wood and metal scraping. Moans came across the 
new brown lake. A small boy was in a tree crying, asking for his parents in 
Norwegian.</p>
<p>I climbed up onto the dyke and looked around. I screamed out for Karin, only 
getting responses in Thai. I stood there, panting, trying to find a thought, 
anything. As I came back to earth I needed to pee. The first thing I did after 
surviving the tsunami was piss! Along limps an older Thai guy, finds me, naked 
atop a dyke amid the destruction, covered in mud and filth – pissing. He didn&#39;t 
even smile…nor did I.</p>
<p>I spent the next minutes running from high point to high point screaming out 
for Karin. If I made it, she could too. There was no response from her. I found 
plenty of other people, and helped who I could, but always looking across this 
vast area of new lakes for her head. Through the trees was a PT boat, a large 
steel police cruiser.</p>
<p>The boat and I had been brought more than a kilometer (2/3 mile) inland. I 
was standing near a tree, hoping for a clue, anything to say she was out there 
somewhere. A small boy in a tree whimpered, and I pulled him down. We went 
inland. There were houses, still standing, a whole neighborhood atop a rise that 
was untouched. Just feet away were cars wrapped around trees. I handed them the 
boy. </p>
<p>I had finished my medic training exactly one month before, so I went to work. 
Pulling people out of mud, from under houses. One car, upright against the trunk 
of a tree still had the driver. He was dead. It went on. Before this I had only 
seen a dead body once or twice. That was remedied very quickly. I pulled people 
out of the water, only to have them choke and die right there. I would take 
someone&#39;s pulse, scream for help, then find that they had died before we could 
do anything. It was beyond any nightmare or fear I have ever had.</p>
<p>An older Thai woman came up to me with a pair of shorts and averted eyes. She 
was ashamed that I was totally naked. I smirked and slipped them on. She smiled 
and scurried away. Was it the bright white ass or the fear shriveled cock that 
had embarrassed her?</p>
<p>Roaming the former streets looking for foreigners to send to the higher 
ground, a place where we could all meet and tend to wounds. After an hour the 
Thais came screaming out of the mud saying there was another wave coming , and 
flying into the hills. We were left alone. Those that could walk did, the rest 
were carried. We made a new base, higher and safer. And the same thing happened 
again. And again.</p>
<p>Eventually we ended up in the jungle at a park, where there was water and 
high ground. It was messy. Eventually there were about 300 foreigners, about 120 
of whom were injured pretty severely with broken limbs and ribs, near-drownings, 
everyone had gashes of some kind, severed fingers or toes and shock everywhere.</p>
<p>There was no medicine, no tools, no scissors, no bandages. Nothing but well 
water (of questionable cleanliness) and some sticks and clothes. I tried to find 
anyone medically trained. It was only the diving instructors who all had basic 
first aid. So we cleaned with the water, we broke sticks and set bones and 
talked people into a relatively calm place. If someone was severely cut, we used 
their own clothing to mend the wounds. It was a horror story. The floor was 
covered in blood, people were moaning, or vomiting or asking us to help them. 
And more arrived with every new wave of cars and trucks fleeing the &quot;next wave&quot;.</p>
<p>After hours of this, we got news of helicopters evacuating the injured. So 
everyone rushed towards the trucks. I had to scream and push and pull people out 
of the way. The ones who needed the evac the most were the ones who couldn&#39;t get 
to the trucks. After twenty minutes of sorting through the priorities, and 
feeling like we had a handle on it, someone brought me to a girl who was 
bleeding severely out of her thigh and was in shock. No one had brought her to 
our little clinic area, they had left her in the back of truck.</p>
<p>Finally, after a few helicopters had pulled out the worst, I headed back 
down.</p>
<p>Through rubber tree plantations, and coconut groves we drove. It seemed quiet 
and relaxed. At the last corner it was devastation. The road was clear and dry 
up to a certain point and then it was a horizon of rubble. I shuddered.<br>
Someone on a scooter came up and asked for a doctor. Everyone looked at me!</p>
<p>I jumped on and they took me up roads I never knew existed, and over bridges 
that were barely standing until I was brought to five foreigners in the middle 
of nowhere. One of them was a good friend and diving instructor. It was the 
first person I had seen that I knew. It was a total joy. He was banged up pretty 
bad, but he got out and sent off to the hospital. Then the Thais came roaring up 
the hill, saying there was another wave. We had to carry four more people with 
broken bones (including a broken hip) up a hill.</p>
<p>There was no wave. There never was.</p>
<p>I stumbled back down, wandering through the town looking for people to help. 
I found only bodies. I found one with a tattoo like Karin&#39;s on a scooter under 
some rubble. I pulled her out, and it was a Thai woman. Still griping her 
scooter, mouth agape. Eventually I made my way back to the dive shop I worked 
at. We had always whinged about how it was too far off the main road, but it 
survived. It was a center for the survivors. I walked up to find friends alive 
and things<br>
clean and organized. I had been able to keep on, doing what I could to help 
people, to close out my mind to what was around me and look only at what I was 
doing, to not see the dead people, to not worry about where Karin was. I had 
held together so well.</p>
<p>When I found out Karin was alive it all fell apart. I could smell the 
destruction, the horror I had just walked through, just lived through, that she 
had lived through. My body shouted out all the bruises and cuts I had ignored. 
It all struck me and threw me to the ground. It was too much – I could no longer 
accept this. We hugged and ate and slept. My feet were cut up, I had small cuts 
allover my body, and a sinus infection from all the bad water.</p>
<p>Karin had gotten hold of a coconut tree, wrapped herself around it and never 
let go. She had a few bruises and small cuts and a black eye. I was ecstatic to 
see her like that. First time I&#39;ve been happy to see a woman with a black eye.<br>
Most of the rest of our friends had come through. They had set up first aid 
stations and help stations, organized food and created a center for people to 
meet. The diving community came together and became our support, our medical 
care, our food - they did everything they could to help and then some.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t help but give massive appreciation and even a bit of awe to several 
people. Whether you know them or not, these are the true heroes. Keith – he was 
tireless - for days, running around, getting medicine, doing first aid, cooking 
food, getting clothes, talking to the forlorn, coordinating doing everything he 
could. His energy was endless and bright. Jim and Andrea opened the doors of 
their shop, and clothed and housed everyone they could. Joakim ran about 
grabbing people, helping wherever he could, evacuating people to the next town, 
the whole while wondering about the safety of his own family. And the two DMT&#39;s 
that helped me out – two guys who had just taken a first aid class and then had 
to deal with massive trauma, death and chaos. And all the others – this was not 
the work of just one or two people.</p>
<p>Of course the diving community at large shined like a beacon over the 
madness. When there was no one else, they all stepped forward. I can&#39;t help but 
swell with pride to count myself among them.</p>
<p>The next day I went back to where my house had been and surveyed the damage. 
One bungalow nearby had been lifted up and dropped on top of another. The whole 
beach was visible, meaning all of the two or three story hotels that had lined 
it were gone. There was a jet ski just near our house. The bottom floor of our 
house was gone, the upper floor was missing a couple of walls. The only thing 
left, was a plastic Jesus doll I had bought as a joke. So I was left with 
nothing in the world except my own plastic Jesus. </p>
<p>The level of destruction is virtually impossible to describe.</p>
<p>On our beach we had approx. 2500 hotel rooms. It looked to me, that maybe 50 
could still be called hotel rooms. The week between Christmas and New Year&#39;s is 
the busiest of the week. Without warning, without an evacuation plan the<br>
survival rates were minimal. The wave at our house was about 7 meters high (20 
feet) and in some places it was 10 meters (30 feet) high. It wiped out the third 
floor of most resorts. The number of dead is astronomical, several thousand on 
my beach alone. By the second day you could smell it, and in the short walk to 
my former house, we passed about 10 bodies just strewn about. Our final glance 
of the town was a cattle truck stacked full of wrapped up corpses. We wanted to 
go home.</p>
<p>In Bangkok most people got help pretty quick. The Swedes, Germans and English 
had charted flights for their citizens to get home. The Thai government gave 
free hotel rooms to survivors and there were lists of places to get food.</p>
<p>EXCEPT the Americans. I went in to find out what help I could get – I was 
able to get a replacement passport, a toothbrush and a paperback book. They said 
it was not their policy to arrange flights home. I was cut up, still<br>
covered in a pretty good layer of mud, I had no home, no money, no clothing 
(except some borrowed off Keith) nothing at all, and they could do nothing to 
help.</p>
<p>They did offer to let me borrow money, but they would have to find three 
people in America who would vouch for me, and that process should take less than 
a week. In the mean time I was fucked. I was destitute and rejected by the 
embassy. Karin was with me (she&#39;s Swedish) and said that I could still try and 
emigrate to Sweden. I was VERY tempted. In these last days, watching politicians 
go on about helping and giving aide, but they won&#39;t even take care of their own 
citizens? I am very, very angry. All the other nations of the world were taking 
care of their own citizens! Eventually I got a flight home with JAL – that would 
be JAPAN airlines – not even an American company, but a JAPANESE company helped 
me get home.</p>
<p>I am still listed as neither found nor alive. Before I left I had spoken to 
the embassy twice on the phone, giving my name so I would be listed as alive so 
my family would not worry. I went to the embassy twice, once to get a passport 
to replace the one lost in the tsunami, and they never listed me as alive or 
found. I flew out of the country using said passport and am still not found. I 
went to the hospital three times, and, as of yesterday I am now listed as 
injured (having been in the states three days already). My family is now waiting 
to see how long it will take before they are notified about<br>
my status. So am I. It does raise a good question – if I am missing or dead, do 
I have to pay taxes?<br>
<br>
While spiteful about the embassy, I am grateful to be alive, and that those I 
care about are still alive. I still look around and am in awe at what just 
happened. I really feel like someone has slipped me some roofies and I woke up 
in America.<br>
<br>
No real moral to this story…yet.<br>

While I am fairly devoid of cash right now, I would prefer that only close 
friends or family use this link to send me gifts…<br>

<p>I would recommend going to <a href="http://www.diveaid.co.uk">
www.diveaid.co.uk</a>. These are divers helping divers. Most of our community, 
while surviving, lost everything. This is a great site with some news of the 
area and those affected.</p>
<p>My story is just one, there and 100,000&#39;s more far worse off – I had 
somewhere to fly to. Donations should be sent to good charities, ones that truly 
help. Doctors Without borders <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org">
http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org</a> and the Thailand Red Cross
<a href="http://www.redcross.or.th/english/home/index.php4">
http://www.redcross.or.th/english/home/index.php4</a> were both there fast and 
helping out immensely. I can&#39;t speak, or even dream of what it must be like in 
Sri Lanka and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Breathe…</p>
