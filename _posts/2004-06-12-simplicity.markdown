<blockquote>Simplicity and non-violence are obviously closely related.
The optimal pattern of consumption, producing a high degree of human
satisfaction by means of a relatively low rate of consumption, allows
people to live without great pressure and strain and to fulfil the
primary injunction of Buddhist teaching: 'Cease to do evil; try to do
good.' As physical resources are everywhere limited, people satisfying
their needs by means of a modest use of resources are obviously less
likely to be at each other's throats than people depending upon a high
rate of use. Equally, people who live in highly self-sufficient local
communities are less likely to get involved in large-scale violence
than people whose existence depends on world-wide systems of trade.</blockquote>from <i>Small Is Beautiful:  Economics as If People Mattered</i> by E.F. Schumacher
