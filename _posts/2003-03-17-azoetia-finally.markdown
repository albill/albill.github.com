My copy of [Azoetia](http://www.xoanon.net/) **finally** arrived today.
For a while last week, it looked like MS Mail had lost it (I had it sent
to work for safety of all reasons). It's very large and very nice
looking. I'll be looking forward to sitting down with it. I've had a
photocopy of the first edition but it's nice to have a clothbound of the
new edition. ![image](http://www.arcanology.com/images/az7.jpg)
