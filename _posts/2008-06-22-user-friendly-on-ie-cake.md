Apparently, the popular web comic <a href="http://www.userfriendly.org/">User Friendly</a> just did a cartoon about the <a href="http://www.arcanology.com/2008/06/17/ie-sends-mozilla-a-new-cake-for-firefox-3/">cake that Internet Explorer sent to Mozilla</a> the other day when we shipped Firefox 3. 

You can <a href="http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20080622">see it on their site</a> in full size but I've added it below in a smaller size as well:

This cake has gotten far more press than I think anyone expected. I guess people like it when conflicts can proceed with a certain amount of grace. As has been suggested, when IE8 ships, we should send the IE team a cake as well but we'll make sure to include the recipe with it so they can make more of them...

Oh, and I like the little "The cake is a lie!" nod in the tiny cake graphic beneath the cake. :-)
