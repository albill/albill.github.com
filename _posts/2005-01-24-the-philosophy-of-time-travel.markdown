I like Donnie Darko. I like it a lot. So, I'm happy to see that other
people have gone to the trouble of creating interesting sites around it.
For your enjoyment, **[The Philosophy of Time

> The Manipulated Living are often the close friends and neighbours of

> violent behaviour. This is the unfortunate result of their task, which
> is to assist the Living Receiver in returning the Artifact to the
> Primary Universe. The Manipulated Living will do anything to save
> themselves from Oblivion.
