Another exciting day on the ranch... This reminds me that I need to make
sure to get to work in time tomorrow morning to fill out an early
report. Ah well. Pretty normal Monday stuff. Ray Kurzweil will be
lecturing at MS on Wednesday, which I will attend. On Friday, Bruce
Sterling will be on campus again (it's been, what, a year?) and I plan
on seeing him as well in true fanboy form. I'll have his new book in
hand. A good lecture week. This evening, I met the incredible for coffee
and chat. We hung out at Third Place Books until it closed and it was
time to go. It's nice to hang out with old friends, especially ones who
I can have a good conversation with. Seeing her reminds me, though, that
I don't seem to get out socially much anymore. I'm not sure why that is,
per se. R and I moved out to the house on the other end of town from
where we once lived and we kind of miss being close to things. It puts
us far from almost all of our friends. The funny thing is that Rubylou
is probably one of the physically closest friends to where we are. She's
only about 15 to 20 minutes from here in the same end of town. Given how
hectic work and adult life can be, I'm not sure I miss talking to people
always but it does give me pause. It is easy to see how couples become
their own self-contained worlds.
