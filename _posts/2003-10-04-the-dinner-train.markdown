R picked up her mother, who was in town at an event for the week, and
the two of them plus R's dad and myself went off to board *The Spirit of
Washington*, which is a dinner train that goes 25 miles down a once
public railroad between Renton and the Columbia Winery. On the way, we
enjoyed a rather nice meal. At the winery, we had a tour and they
engaged in a little wine tasting. Afterwards, we rode the train back and
generally had an enjoyable time. It's a nice quiet evening going through
the back ways in otherwise familiar cities. I just finished Iain
McCalman's **The Last Alchemist**, which is his excellent biography of
Count Cagliostro. This book just reaffirms much of my interest in
masonry and its role in the various democratic or popular movements in
previous centuries against the entrenched monarchies and structures of
the day (for better or worse). It's a good read.
