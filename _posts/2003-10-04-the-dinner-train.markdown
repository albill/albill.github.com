R picked up her mother, who was in town at an event for the week, and the two of them plus R&apos;s dad and myself went off to board <i>The Spirit of Washington</i>, which is a dinner train that goes 25 miles down a once public railroad between Renton and the Columbia Winery. On the way, we enjoyed a rather nice meal. At the winery, we had a tour and they engaged in a little wine tasting. Afterwards, we rode the train back and generally had an enjoyable time. It&apos;s a nice quiet evening going through the back ways in otherwise familiar cities.

I just finished Iain McCalman&apos;s <b>The Last Alchemist</b>, which is his excellent biography of Count Cagliostro. This book just reaffirms much of my interest in masonry and its role in the various democratic or popular movements in previous centuries against the entrenched monarchies and structures of the day (for better or worse). It&apos;s a good read.
