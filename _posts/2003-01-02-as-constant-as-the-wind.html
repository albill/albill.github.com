So, I'm registered for Latin 101 now... Tue and Thur from 7:40 to 9:10 PM.

Now that my class is later, maybe I can actually get into a martial arts class (since every low-end class in the world seems to be Tue and Thur at 6:00 PM).

Greek, I hardly knew you...

Don't worry, if and when I go to Grad Schools, Ancient Greek and I will probably be buddies again. I decided to take the slightly easier class now since I have to do it after work at night. Greek is more directly applicable to certains texts that I'm interested in but European magic, as a whole, and a number of my other interests would require Latin at some point as well. As  pointed out, it makes sense to do both and, with just a year of Latin, I can at least puzzle through many texts, which isn't necessarily the case with a year of Greek.

I don't know when I'm going back to school anyway at this point. I have reservations and then there are money concerns. R and I have spoken, a few times, about maybe purchasing a home or somesuch and that might be more immediate than school for me.
