When we did the inspection, I took the opportunity to take photos of the
new house with my camera. In our previous house, I did not do that and
regretted it in later years. The set is up on Flickr
[here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157594377605158/).
Here are a couple of choice ones:
