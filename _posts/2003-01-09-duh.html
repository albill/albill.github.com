So, my new <strong>Latin</strong> class is Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7:40 to 9:10 PM. This is actually a much better time for me since I was having to duck out of work an hour early two days a week and then make up time otherwise with the old class... So, I showed up on Tuesday, walked to the blackboard in the school's office to see which room my class was in and the blackboard was empty... There were staff talking at the main desk right by it so I walked over and asked where my class was...

"Class? What class?"
"Latin 102..."
"Classes don't start until Thursday. Go home!"

Oops. Yep, they're right, it says Jan 9 on all of my crap. Duuuh.

On a plus note, R and I went and attend 's class on <strong>Masturbation and Thelema</strong> aka <strong>How the Mass of the Phoenix is really Sex Magick</strong> tonight. We had a good time and the topic matter always makes for good gutter humor. "Do you need to have a 3-5-3 stroke when you're wanking it magically?"

Next month will be the <strong>Star Sapphire as Sex Magick</strong> aka <strong>Get it on as a pair magically.</strong>

It adds new meaning to "Ra comes now in his bark..."
