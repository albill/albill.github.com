Another potential tattoo design along the same kind of lines.

This is the Siddham form of three of the bodhisattvas. In the center is
**Shaka Nyorai**, which is Shakyamuni Buddha, the historical Buddha. On
the right is **Monju Bosatsu**, who is known as **Manjushri** to those
of us familiar with Tibetan Buddhism. In the Japanese tradition, he is
the left hand attendant of Shaka Nyorai. He is the personification of
Wisdom. On the left is **Fugen Bosatsu**, who is known as Samantabhadra
in Tibetan Buddhism. He is the right hand attendant of Shaka Nyorai in
the Japanese tradition. He epitomizes teaching, meditation and practice.
In the Dzogchen traditions, of course, Samantabhadra is the Atibuddha,
the primordial source of the Dzogchen teachings. To my knowledge, these
teachings are not part of Japanese esoteric Buddhism, which does not
have all nine yanas within it.
