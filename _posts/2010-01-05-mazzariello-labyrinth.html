This last weekend, R and I were looking for something to do together. I recalled that there is a labyrinth locally in a state park and suggested that we hike out to it. One thing that isn't readily apparent when you live in the Bay Area is how close some fairly large parks are to the urban areas. R has been making a point of hiking these during the last couple of years but I haven't seen most of them. The labyrinth is in the Sibley Volcanic Regional Preserve, a large park in the hills behind Oakland about fifteen minutes away from my house. It spans the tops of the hills that separate the coast from the more arid inland areas. The labyrinth is in an old quarry (looking like a small canyon) about twenty or so minutes hike in if you know where you are going. If you don't know where you are going, as was the case with us, it can take you about an hour to find. You can see the labyrinth clearly on <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Sibley+Volcanic+Regional+Preserve,+Orinda,+CA+94563&sll=37.85019,-122.283831&sspn=0.013995,0.018518&ie=UTF8&hq=Sibley+Volcanic+Regional+Preserve&hnear=Sibley+Volcanic+Regional+Preserve,+Orinda,+CA+94563&ll=37.85298,-122.190434&spn=0.000875,0.001157&t=h&z=20">Google Maps</a> if you zoom in on the park and know where to look. <div align="center">

It is a classical (or 7-circuit), left-handed, earthen labyrinth with the lines set out in pieces of local rock. The term, "labyrinth," dates from Greek legends of Crete and the labyrinth there with its minotaur at the center.

They are seen by many to be sacral constructions that one walks as a form of meditation or pilgrimage. I've known many people that made a practice of labyrinth walking, at least on occasion. They have been used by both non-Christian traditions in Europe and the Middle East (and, separately, in pre-contact North America). Grace Cathedral in San Francisco has a well-known labyrinth that I've still never visited: <div align="center">

R and I were alone in the space so, after a few photos, we took the opportunity to walk the labyrinth (and its tiny neighbor) while listening to the frogs. It was a bit water logged in places but it is clear that we were far from the only recent visitors, given the objects left in shrine-like fashion at the center of the main labyrinth.
