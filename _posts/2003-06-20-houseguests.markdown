So, we have Jason Newcomb, author of <b>21st Century Mage</b>, staying in our house this weekend. I&apos;ve just spent the last couple of hours chatting about magic and the OTO with him.

He&apos;s doing a lecture at Edge of the Circle Books tomorrow and will be at the Gnostic Mass on Sunday...

On the house front, we should be signing the papers by Monday. Let&apos;s all cross fingers.
