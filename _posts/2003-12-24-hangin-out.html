I put R on the plane this morning to go visit her family in the Bay Area. Madeline was over from last night until a short while ago so I got to spend a fair amount of time with her. Her mother just picked Madeline up and they were off to my former in-laws for Christmas Eve.

I&apos;m going to see my grandparents (and Madeline) tomorrow for Christmas Day Brunch and presents since my grandparents are rabid Christians. At this point, I&apos;m hanging out by myself outside of that until this weekend. I took Friday off from work in order to get five days off in a row and R will come back on Sunday from her parents&apos; place. 

As a general rule, I don&apos;t get the holiday blues. It isn&apos;t one of my issues in life (which is good since I obviously have so many others) but it really bites that everything is closed today and tomorrow to a fair degree. I&apos;m at home by myself with our small furry pets and I wouldn&apos;t find something, anything, fucking interesting to do besides entertain myself with the Internet, bad music, and reading my books.

The last week or so has been only so-so at work. The plan we had of "Let&apos;s catch up on the backlog of random shit over the holidays" disappeared with the security work that suddenly rolled in when a number of exploits went public in late November. I&apos;ve been having people do testing for this stuff but 2/3 of my team has been out (one had to have surgery even) so I&apos;ve been fucked in the manpower department in many ways. This is leaving aside that it is hard to get work done when every second person that you need to ask about something is "gone until 1/5. see ya!" according to their Out of Office message. I&apos;m glad I have some time away from it all.
