I'm a huge Mythbusters fan (much to my wife's tired acceptance). Co-host Adam Savage spoke at Maker Faire the other week. The topic of his discussion is failure and it is a pretty interesting speech by him (if you find him interesting at all). I'm sorry that I missed seeing him live but this is good enough! I encourage people to watch it. I've embedded it below but you can find it <a href="http://fora.tv/2009/05/30/MythBuster_Adam_Savages_Colossal_Failures">here</a> as well. (The link at fora.tv is to a much higher quality streaming version.) <lj-embed></lj-embed>
