Am I moving more to the Left and being less of a Centrist as I age?

I find Ken McLeod's <a href="http://kenmacleod.blogspot.com/2004_06_01_kenmacleod_archive.html#108653807760902538">post on communism</a> to be somewhat inspiring. My family would be appalled.

A lot of the core truths that were in communism and socialism have never become less true. The application has never happened and, perhaps, never will. I do believe that a global society is necessary but I don't think I'd ever want a global government dominating things. There has to be a middle ground.

By the way, if you haven't read any of his novels, you should. He's one of the best things to come out of Scotland in a while in Science Fiction and is a childhood friend of Iain Banks.
