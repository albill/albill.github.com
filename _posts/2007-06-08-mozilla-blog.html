My shiny new Mozilla blog is open for business.

It is at <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/al/">http://blog.mozilla.com/al/</a>. I'll probably conduct most of my Mozilla posting there so as not to cross the streams because, as we all know, crossing the streams is "bad."

I wouldn't want to run the risk of one of my tirades or discussions of the disease which reading St. Thomas Aquinas causes (kind of a rash) to be forced upon people who are really only interested in Mozilla business.
