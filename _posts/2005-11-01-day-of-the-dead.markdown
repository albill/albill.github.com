One of the events was the pumpkin carving. While I didn't win, I did get to bring home a 30 lb or so pumpkin. It has a big scar down the front from how it grew and I incorporated it into the design. I also took the time to help little kiddies carve fake (styrofoam or something) pumpkins when they came to trick or treat. Given how multinational our crew is, I should have expected it but I was surprised by how many people had never carved a pumpkin before, in both my own group and with the visiting kids. We have a lot of Indian and Chinese coworkers (and quite a few one-off people from a variety of other nations). I suppose the pumpkin carving is really an American tradition more than anything else. They seemed to get the idea quickly enough though I noticed that no one ever asked why we did it...

For those that don't know, a dumb supper is conducted in silence (hence the name) with the dead as guests. A place is set for them and food is given to them. It is a time to contemplate our friends and family that have left the world as sitting with us as welcome guests for a while. We did this by candlelight in the dark. After the meal, I took the food out and left it as an offering near the large tree behind the house. When I've done food offerings before, the food always goes to that tree, which is at least 50 years old if not quite a bit older.
