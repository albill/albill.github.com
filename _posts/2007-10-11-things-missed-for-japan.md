... about going to Japan is that we missed the Folsom Street Fair this year. We went last year and we took a few pictures. Personally, I don't recall seeing anything too terribly unusual there but maybe I'm just blind or something.

I know that there is a segment of the population shocked, horrified, or just disgusted by such things. Unfortunately for some, I've never been one of them, even as a straight white guy. I do question the good taste of some acts or costuming in public but that's about as far as it goes.

If I hadn't witnessed enough of the crap that gay and lesbian friends, mentors, and family have had to put up with over the years, maybe I would see things differently but I truly doubt it. Also, hearing some of the things that one friend of R's and mine had to do and live under in the 1950's and 60's as a gay man in the military tends to put a lot of things in perspective for me. Hearing of friends ostracized by their family and faith also does the same.

In the end, I'm a big believer in the principle of "If you don't like it, leave it alone and mind your own business" as long as it involves both adults and is consensual. Human relations, especially sexual relations, are a horribly complex thing and it is best to let people work out things as they may for their happiness.
