David Noss is the author of the textbook for the World Religion graduate class that I am taking for my Master's. He has a nice summary quote of the nature of the world in the Buddha's teachings that I find particularly apropos. I think it resonates relatively well with modern thought.
<blockquote>“Wherever we observe it, the living world, whether about us or within ourselves, is constantly in flux, in a state of endless becoming. There is no central, planning world self, no sovereign Person in the heavens holding all together in unity. There is only the ultimate unity of Being itself, whose peace enfolds the individual self when it ceases to call itself ‘I’ and enters the featureless purity of Nirvana."</blockquote>
