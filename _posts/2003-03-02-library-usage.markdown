So I paid my fee to renew my University of Washington Alumni membership on Friday. Sometime in the next two weeks, I should get a card for it in the mail. At that point, I can go down to the University and get my library card again. Alumni have borrowing rights at the UW libraries. Of course, I think that I have about $50 in late fees from 1994 but that's ok... ;-)

There are books that I want access to and to make copies of all or part of... Using the photocopy machines at the UW costs .15 a page. There are certain other ones which are much cheaper for me...
