I've been a fan of [Pema
Chödrön](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pema_Chödrön) for a while. She's
been one of the better teachers and writers to come out of Chögyam
Trungpa Rinpoche's lineage of practice and the Shambhala Tradition in
the last few decades. Her works seem to be pretty widely read outside of
the immediate Buddhist community as well, which is a bit of an
accomplishment. I've actually done a bit of training in the Shambhala
Tradition in the past and it, in a way, acts as an excellent bridge
between Tibetan Practice and the West. Trungpa was quite accomplished in
bridging cultures. I've also found the sitting practice that they teach
to be a quite excellent introduction for beginners. [![Smile at
Fear](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4089/5017780301_209d73ec78.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/5017780301/ "Smile at Fear by albill, on Flickr")
Pema has been a stalwart standard bearer for Trungpa's legacy in her
writing especially. There is a new book by Chögyam Trungpa that just
came out, [Smile at
Fear](http://www.shambhala.com/html/catalog/items/isbn/978-1-59030-885-1.cfm).
It's description is:

> "Many of us, without even realizing it, are dominated by fear. We
> might be aware of some of our fears—perhaps we are afraid of public
> speaking, of financial hardship, or of losing a loved one. Chögyam
> Trungpa shows us that most of us suffer from a far more pervasive
> fearfulness: fear of ourselves. We feel ashamed and embarrassed to
> look at our feelings or acknowledge our styles of thinking and acting;
> we don’t want to face the reality of our moment-to-moment experience.
> It is this fear that keeps us trapped in cycles of suffering, despair,
> and distress. Chögyam Trungpa offers us a vision of moving beyond fear
> to discover the innate bravery, trust, and delight in life that lies
> at the core of our being. Drawing on the Shambhala Buddhist teachings,
> he explains how we can each become a spiritual warrior: a person who
> faces each moment of life with openness and fearlessness. 'The
> ultimate definition of bravery is not being afraid of who you are,'
> writes Chögyam Trungpa. In this book he offers the insights and
> strategies to claim victory over fear."

Focusing on this book and the teachings in it, Pema Chödrön is doing a
weekend teaching retreat here in California, "**Smile at Fear: Finding a
True Heart of Bravery**" in mid-October. The local event has been sold
out for some time now but Shambhala Publications has arranged for an
online version of it to occur. During the event from the evening of
Friday, October 15 through the afternoon of Sunday, October 17, the
video of Pema teaching will be streamed in real-time. Following the
online event, those that participated in it will be able to view it on
demand for two months and get an edited copy of the event video along
with an e-book of "Smile at Fear." The official description of the
retreat states:

> "The 'Smile at Fear' retreat is a rare opportunity to practice and
> study with Pema in real time, as she teaches wisdom learned from her
> own teacher, Chögyam Trungpa. Using his book of the same title, she
> shows how to approach the things that scare us in a radically
> different way than we're accustomed to, and in doing so to discover
> how astonishingly insignificant fear really is—and how surprisingly
> simple it is to access the heart of fearlessness. These are Buddhist
> teachings and practices that can become resources for a lifetime."

Given how many people are interested in her work and how few of us live
in California (or, like me, are in California but cannot attend since it
is sold out), this isn't a bad option at all. It's basically $60 for
access to roughly fourteen hours of teaching by Pema Chödrön which is a
pretty good deal. You can [sign
up](http://shop.shambhala.com/smile-at-fear) at the event site over at
Shambhala Publications. ***Shambhala Publications has helpfully offered
to give two tickets to the online retreat away to readers of this blog.
If you're interested in attending, please post a comment about why you'd
like to attend and maybe some anecdote about how Buddhist or meditative
practice has impacted your ability to work with the difficulties we
encounter day to day. I'll pick two people (assuming there are more than
two) from the responses.*** If you want to know more about Pema Chödrön,
you can watch a wonderful interview with her by Bill Moyers below or
