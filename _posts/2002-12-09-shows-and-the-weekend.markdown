I haven't been logging as much as I should recently...I should try to be better about that. Quite a few entries are also Friends only for those that may read my journal but aren't on my friends list (50% at a guess). So, if you really want to read my stuff, you should contact me. ;-)

Anyway... and I helped the <a href="http://www.cabiri.org">Cabiri</a> with the "Cirque" show (never heard another name for it) this weekend. This was a paying show for a corporate holiday party. It was an hour long and we did it twice on the same evening.  did a lot of wonderful work as the main character. We had a well known contortionist (that trapecia has written about on her journal) up, some acrobats and the band from Circus Contraption, another local group, and a variety of other parties beyond the normal Cabiri bunch. From what I've heard, this show was put together in three weeks from nothing so I think that it pretty impressive.

R and I were, effectively, stagehands for the show. Move props around when people aren't looking, put flaming balls of death out when they are taken offstage, etc. Someday I may learn to do aerial work but it doesn't seem like it's going to happen soon and there is the open issue, for some, of whether a 195 pound guy is going up on a trapeze though opinions do seem to vary about whether this is really an issue.

I haven't been doing much at all when it relates to performing in the last few months. I had a bit part in one of the last Cabiri shows but since we aren't meeting weekly for a class anymore, it seems like things have slowed down dramatically for everyone.

That thing ate up almost all of Saturday. Yesterday, my daughter, Madeline, came over in the morning and we hung out watching cartoons and such. In the afternoon, I put together the ritual for Ouroboros and prepped a little platonic solid (used ritually) for painting but it turned out that I didn't have enough of the right color of paint. We met later on but postponed our ritual work to next weekend.

I finished the new Ken Macleod book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1841491489/">Engine City</a> which finishes off his <strong>Engines of Light</strong> trilogy. I don't know if I really felt satisfied with the last book and the trilogy. Ken is still one of my favorite authors but the book was short (each of the books in the trilogy is under 300 pages) and went in a very different direction than the previous two. The ending felt overly enigmatic as well and some of what I felt were the big issues in trilogy never really got resolved well...

The next novel is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/055358443X">The Collapsium</a> which I picked up because the  will be meeting to cover it next. I've only just started it but it seems well written.

Other than that, I'm reading Chagdud Rinpoche's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1881847314/">Gates to Buddhist Practice</a>. This is one of the better books on various Tibetan Buddhist topics that I've read recently. Chagdud Rinpoche's writing style is easily accessible and very open. I actually enjoy reading it (which is more than a certain few Buddhist books evoke...).

Luckily, my Greek class ends for a month after this week and I have the last two weeks of the year off so I may get to finish all of my reading and do a few more projects.
