We had dinner with our friend Sean the Drakemonger last night. Sean quit
Apple a bit over a month ago after many years of working for them remote
from Seattle. Google up in Redmond gave him a job but mandated that he
come down to the Bay Area for orientation. After two days of being
surrounded by his fellow employees, he had to escape to San Francisco,
where we met him for dinner. We went out to a nice thai place in SOMA
and then to a local bar for a few drinks. Along with various amusing
descriptions of Google and the way things work there (he has to tell
them what project he wants to work on and then try to convince the
people in charge of it to take him), he confessed that there seems to be
a little bit of hazing that goes on at Google. New Google people are
called Nooglers for "New Googler." They are referred to constantly by
this term and even eventually receive a propeller beanie at the end of
orientation with the term on it:

Geekdom has no shame. We spent the rest of the evening making up new
Noogler terms (and Sean told me that I wouldn't get far at the company
if I chortled every time the term came up):

-   Noogles
-   Noogster
-   Noogerini
-   Noogy
-   Noogs
-   Noogly
-   KaNoogler
-   Boogler

All of this much funnier after a few drinks, of course.
