<p>Took Freya (my female cat) in for x-rays tonight. We&#39;ll know whether her 
mammary cancer has spread tomorrow. Even if it hasn&#39;t, the tumors are large 
enough that she&#39;s probably not operable. Depending on the x-rays, we&#39;ll know how 
long she has though. If it looks bad, I&#39;m probably going to put her down when it 
looks like she&#39;s getting much pain.</p>
<p>On another note, it looks like she picked up fleas from our new cat, Nova, 
who seems to have come with them. I put down a large chunk of change and got 
Advantage for all three cats (and the ferret!) to get them flea clean. I also 
got prescription dewormer for the cats because Nova has tapeworms now from the 
fleas and I&#39;m afraid that it&#39;s spread to the others. Needless to say, after an 
hour and a half at the vet with Freya, all the cats down the fun surprise of the 
&quot;let&#39;s swallow a large pill game.&quot; Cats love that shit. </p>
<p>The ferret, on the other hand, could have cared less about the advantage I 
put on her. Psycho little happy spaz that she is.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I&#39;m going to Los Angeles for a Software Quality Assurance 
conference with my boss and another coworker. Yee-haw! More specifically, we&#39;re 
going to Anaheim. We&#39;ll be at the Disneyland Hotel until Friday afternoon, when 
we return. I think a small side trip to the Magic Kingdom may be in order. </p>
