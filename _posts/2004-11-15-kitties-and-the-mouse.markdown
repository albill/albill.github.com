Took Freya (my female cat) in for x-rays tonight. We'll know whether her
mammary cancer has spread tomorrow. Even if it hasn't, the tumors are
large enough that she's probably not operable. Depending on the x-rays,
we'll know how long she has though. If it looks bad, I'm probably going
to put her down when it looks like she's getting much pain.

On another note, it looks like she picked up fleas from our new cat,
Nova, who seems to have come with them. I put down a large chunk of
change and got Advantage for all three cats (and the ferret!) to get
them flea clean. I also got prescription dewormer for the cats because
Nova has tapeworms now from the fleas and I'm afraid that it's spread to
the others. Needless to say, after an hour and a half at the vet with
Freya, all the cats down the fun surprise of the "let's swallow a large
pill game." Cats love that shit.

The ferret, on the other hand, could have cared less about the advantage
I put on her. Psycho little happy spaz that she is.

Tomorrow, I'm going to Los Angeles for a Software Quality Assurance
conference with my boss and another coworker. Yee-haw! More
specifically, we're going to Anaheim. We'll be at the Disneyland Hotel
until Friday afternoon, when we return. I think a small side trip to the
Magic Kingdom may be in order.
