My Ipod's battery seems to be toast. It warns me of &quot;low battery&quot; all the time and shuts itself off, even an hour after charging it.<br /><br />I thought the system had just gotten out of synch so I fully charged it from the wall and then wiped the firmware back to factory defaults. I loaded my podcasts and things seemed fine. I then copied all of my music, walked away from the machine with it playing and had it saying &quot;low battery&quot; a minute later. It looks like I need to self-service it by getting a new battery since Apple certainly doesn't do that for you.
