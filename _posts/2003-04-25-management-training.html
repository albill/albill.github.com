Today has been an especially long day. Today and tomorrow are the second annual Leads Offsite for leads on the Windows Client team at Microsoft. I spent my entire day at a nice retreat center sitting at a table while various people did presentations on client issues, engineering process, and various other tasks or issues. In between each session, we had a ten minute discussion at each of our round tables (with 10 people at each table) and then we had to stand up and give a take-away or three from the presentation as redacted by those of us at the table. We did get a nice lunch and coffee was ever flowing but it makes for a long day away from the day to day work (which nags in the back of all of our minds). I then went from this to a coffee shop to work on my Latin homework for tonight and then to my Latin 102 class, which I missed the first couple of weeks of while in Greece. I&apos;m catching up but I&apos;m still behind. I got home around 9:30 PM, made dinner and then finished watching <b>Supercop</b> on the Tivo with R. We&apos;re enjoying the device though I haven&apos;t had a chance to watch the <b>Trigun</b> and <b>Cowboy Bebop</b> episodes that I&apos;ve started recording (I&apos;ve never watched either of these before). R seems to like <b>Reign</b>, an anime that looks visually reminiscent of <b>Aeon Flux</b>. I haven&apos;t watched any of that one yet but probably will... Off to bed now for a day of breakout sessions tomorrow. In the evening, my daughter will come over to spend the night and then we&apos;re all going hiking with on Saturday.
