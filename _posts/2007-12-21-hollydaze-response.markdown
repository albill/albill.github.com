I [blogged
recently](http://www.arcanology.com/2007/12/11/the-hollydaze/) about the
Holidays and a [super geeky Youtube
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVZczLuoJoU) with a bunch of
LARPers destroying a nativity play. I found out today that the [creators
of the video](http://www.fortaxreasons.com/) did their own [Youtube
response video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB53He_pTpo) critiquing
the inconsistencies of their own video. It's worth watching for a laugh.
I like the anti-paladin rant. It reminds me of [this t-shirt
design](http://www.jinx.com/men/shirts/video_games/i_am_not_a_geek.html?&cid=4&catid=4&ps=20&fp=7#bigdesign):
