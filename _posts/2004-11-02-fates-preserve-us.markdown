<p>Oh gods. I&#39;m on my last beer and it isn&#39;t enough. Why do I live in a country 
of morons?</p>
<p>It&#39;s time for the west coast to either allow ourselves to be annexed by 
Canada or form &quot;Leftopia&quot; and get away from all of these right wing 
fucks.</p>
<p>I need more alcohol.</p>
