I'll be flying down to San Jose, California tomorrow night. I'll be at
Microsoft's Silicon Valley Campus (SVC) in Mountain View all day
Wednesday and then be coming back. Since I'll be in the neighborhood, I
may see about having coffee with one of my friends in San Francisco.
I'll have a car and my evening will be free. On another note, I turned
in my third paper for my Greek Philosophy/Politics/Whatever class on
Friday. That leaves me my research paper on the changing nature of the
soul in Greek philosophy from Homer through Plato to do. It is due by
the twenty-first, when the term ends. The last paper for my class on
Western Esotericism, on methodology, is due at the same time so it is
going to be a bit of a crunch time. After this term, I only have one
class. Looking at the possibilities (it needed to be within the
philosophy program), I signed up for the class on Jean-Jacques Rousseau
instead of the one on the philosophy of post-modernism. I get to read
Voltaire as well for the coursework, which sounds like a nice way to
spend the summer. After this, I just have a single credit thesis
preparation class to write the first chapter of my thesis and then the
thesis itself...
