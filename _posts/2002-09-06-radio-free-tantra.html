I found <a href="http://www.lamrim.com">LamRim.com</a> today. It is a Tibetan Buddhist internet radio site but they make their files available in mp3 format. This is very convenient since I have a largish mp3 player that I can take with me. Now I just need to be able to play mp3 files in the car and I'd be set.

His Holiness the Dalai Lama has lectures here as well as many other teachers. Interesting stuff.

I wish more teachers of all paths made their recorded teachings available online. It seems like an easy win for a group or a teacher if they can afford the bandwidth.

I bought a set of Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche's teachings on Red Tara this last week. It's three tapes with something like 240 minutes of teaching. Too bad I don't have a tape player in my car or a walkman... We have the one attached to the house stereo of R's. I'm planning on borrowing someone's walkman and piping the audio back into my computer to record as a set of mp3s so I can listen to it wherever.
