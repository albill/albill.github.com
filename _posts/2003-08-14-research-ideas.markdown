I'm investigating schools again. It turns out that the Open University in the UK has a graduate level Religious Studies department and that members of it focus on Western Esotericism and Paganism.

I'm trying to think of ideas for a thesis if I, for some reason, did decide to apply.

My interests for such a thing probably mostly revolve around:
<ul>
	<li>Modern Hermetic Magic</li>
	<li>Fraternal Order (magical or otherwise) in the 20th century</li>
	<li>Beliefs and practices of modern magical or pagan groups</li>
	<li>Problems and the solutions arrived at for modern faiths of this sort</li>
	<li>Cross-cultural borrowing and sampling in modern spirituality</li>
</ul>
If anyone has any ideas in their noggins, I'd love to hear them.
