I'm investigating schools again. It turns out that the Open University
in the UK has a graduate level Religious Studies department and that
members of it focus on Western Esotericism and Paganism. I'm trying to
think of ideas for a thesis if I, for some reason, did decide to apply.
My interests for such a thing probably mostly revolve around:

-   Modern Hermetic Magic
-   Fraternal Order (magical or otherwise) in the 20th century
-   Beliefs and practices of modern magical or pagan groups
-   Problems and the solutions arrived at for modern faiths of this sort
-   Cross-cultural borrowing and sampling in modern spirituality

If anyone has any ideas in their noggins, I'd love to hear them.
