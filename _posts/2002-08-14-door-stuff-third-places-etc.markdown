I tend to have stuff on my door at work. I used to have a whole bunch of
comics from [RedMeat](http://www.redmeat.com) which appropriately
disturbed many coworkers but only enough to ensure "freak" status
amongst the test leads and test organization, not enough to get me
narc'd out to HR (read: The Political Office) for a tallking too. I took
those down a while back because we were moving to a new building and my
door has been empty since then. Yesterday, I decided to put some stuff
up again. One of the performance testers who is on the other side of the
hall from me said "Oh crap, you're putting stuff on your door again." as
soon as he saw me there cutting papers and with a roll of tape. I found
this amusing because I'm not putting anything truly disturbing up this
time. I put up some images/diagrams and text about
[Aula](http://www.aula.cc), the Finnish cybercommunity that also has its
own space and system for people to meet in a collective manner for
discussion, art, presentations, etc. I find "Third Places" fascinating.
If you don't know the term, it is for those places that are neither work
nor home that we congregate in or use socially. Think of your local
coffeehouse, think of the bar in "Cheers," that sort of thing. Social
spaces. I've spent a fair amount of my adult life meeting friends in
spaces like this and I've had a draw to them, how they are organized,
their function, for quite some time. I've often thought of owning some
kind of space and the uses it could be put towards in community. On
another note, my birthday is this coming Monday. I'm not allowed to buy
much stuff for myself (regardless of the bonus I get today) until after
then or will hurt me. I did order some used Buddhist books by [Geshe
Kelsang
Gyatso](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&field-author=Gyatso,%20Geshe%20Kelsang/)
(who is on the outs with a chunk of the Dharma world but I won't get
into that) such as [Tantric Grounds and Paths: How to Enter, Progress
On, and Complete the Vajrayana
Path](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/094800634X/). His books on
various Tantric topics have been highly recommended to me and I have his
book on Vajrayogini and have been impressed by it. You can find used
hardcover editions (which I like) for much cheaper than his new
paperbacks so I ordered a few of them this last week. [The
Cabiri](http://www.cabiri.org) have a small show this Saturday. There
won't be any fire and it should be small but it may be a bit of fun.
