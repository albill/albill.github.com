As some may or may not have heard, the [Seventeenth
Karmapa](http://www.kagyuoffice.org/karmapa.html), Orgyen Trinley Dorje,
is going to be in the United States in a month for a couple of weeks.
This visit to the United States is the first time that he has been able
to come here to visit or to teach. The Karmapa is the head of the [Karma
Kagyu](http://www.kagyuoffice.org/) school within the Kagyu branch of
Tibetan Buddhism. He was born in Tibet and recognized as the new Karmapa
there, with the oversight of the Chinese government. In 2000, he
secretly escaped from his monastery with a few others and fled to India.
In India, his movements are fairly restricted by the Indian government
(a virtual house arrest, in my opinion) and he hasn't been allowed to
travel often outside of the Dharamsala area, where most of the Tibetans
in India live. He will be teaching in New York City, Boulder, and
Seattle. Tickets for these events go on sale this week (starting
tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM Eastern Time). The schedule of events is as
follows: **Public Teachings in New York City** Saturday, May 17th:
Hammerstein Ballroom Public Teachings at 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM Sunday,
May 18th: Waldorf-Astoria Ballroom A Full Afternoon of Public Teachings
Starting at 2:00 PM Tickets available through
[Tix.com](http://www.tix.com) on Monday, April 14 **Public Teachings in
Boulder** Sunday, May 25th: Macky Auditorium at the University of
Colorado Public Teachings at 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM Tickets available
through [TicketsWest](http://ticketswest.rdln.com/), and at KingSoopers
retail locations on Tuesday, April 15. Tickets **Public Teachings in
Seattle** Saturday, May 31st: Paramount Theatre Public Teachings at
10:00 AM and 2:00 PM Sunday, June 1st: Paramount Theatre Chenrezig
Empowerment at 10:00 AM and Public Teaching at 2:00 PM Tickets available
through [TicketMaster](http://www.ticketmaster.com/) on Monday, April
14. The official Web site for the Karmapa's visit to the U.S. is
[karmapavisit.org](http://www.karmapavisit.org). I may very well be in
Seattle for this but I haven't made a final determination yet.
