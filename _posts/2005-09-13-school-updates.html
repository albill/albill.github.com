<p>I have finally finished Edmund Burke's<strong> Reflections on the Revolution in  France </strong>and can, joyfully, move on to reading Thomas Paine. I need to try to  get my mid-term paper (due the week after I get back from Thailand) written or  at least drafted before we leave on September 23.</p> <p>On another note, I'll be in San Francisco the week of November 11 visiting  with my friends from the <a href="http://www.osogd.org/">Open Source Order of the  Golden Dawn</a>. I'll probably be staying with R's rents but I will have a car.  Please feel free to contact me if you might want to get together and you live  there. I'll be there most of Friday and free then. Otherwise, I'm going to <strong> Field's Books</strong>.</p>
