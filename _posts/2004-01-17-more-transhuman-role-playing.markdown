**Orion's Arm** ([http://www.orionsarm.com/](http://www.orionsarm.com/))
is a shared universe created by a group of people for years for the
purposes of role-playing games. It is also being used by some for their
own fiction. Interesting stuff.

> It is ten thousand years in the future. Civilization spans the stars,
> and humanity has branched into myriad directions. Godlike ascended
> intelligences rule vast interstellar empires, while lesser factions
> seek to carve out their own dominions through intrigue and conquest.
> Trillions of sentient beings exist across billions of cubic light
> years - on the surface of planets, in giant orbital habitats, in domes
> and blueskies on moons and comets, and in space ships. But beyond the
> safety of the human-friendly worlds of the Civilized Galaxy, beyond
> the post-scarcity angelnetted nanotopias of limitless abundance and
> freedom from harm, adventure awaits those prepared to risk all.

They have cool things like [Dyson
Trees](http://www.orionsarm.com/civ/Dyson_Trees.html) in their setting
as well...
