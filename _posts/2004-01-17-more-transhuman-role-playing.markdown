<strong>Orion's Arm</strong> (<a href="http://www.orionsarm.com/">http://www.orionsarm.com/</a>) is a shared universe created by a group of people for years for the purposes of role-playing games. It is also being used by some for their own fiction. Interesting stuff.
<blockquote>It is ten thousand years in the future. Civilization spans the stars, and humanity has branched into myriad directions. Godlike ascended intelligences rule vast interstellar empires, while lesser factions seek to carve out their own dominions through intrigue and conquest. Trillions of sentient beings exist across billions of cubic light years - on the surface of planets, in giant orbital habitats, in domes and blueskies on moons and comets, and in space ships. But beyond the safety of the human-friendly worlds of the Civilized Galaxy, beyond the post-scarcity angelnetted nanotopias of limitless abundance and freedom from harm, adventure awaits those prepared to risk all.Â </blockquote>
They have cool things like <a href="http://www.orionsarm.com/civ/Dyson_Trees.html">Dyson Trees</a> in their setting as well...
