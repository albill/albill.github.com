We shipped <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/">Firefox 4</a> today at Mozilla, where I work. This is a big deal for us and for the open web as well. (Go download it!)

Following the friendly tradition, the Internet Explorer team just sent us a fine cake, as they have on previous releases:

When <a href="http://openbuddha.com/2008/06/17/ie-sends-mozilla-a-new-cake-for-firefox-3/">we received one for Firefox 3</a>, it was about a year after I started working here. By coincidence, I happened to answer the door so I was the one to receive it that time and a former Internet Explorer coworker of mine, Sean, dropped it off, which was amusing. 

You can see the Firefox 3 cake (with me):

Then there is the <a href="http://fredericiana.com/2006/10/24/from-redmond-with-love/">old Firefox 2 cake</a> to compare it against:

I haven't tried the one we got today yet but I'm looking forward to it.
