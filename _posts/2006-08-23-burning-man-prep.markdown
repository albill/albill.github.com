Items gathered for Burning Man in the last few weeks:

-   1 - 2.5 Gallon Solar Shower
-   3 - 7 Gallon Water containers
-   1 - Thermarest self-inflating matress (mmmmm)
-   1 - Inflatable easy chair
-   1 - LED head lamp
-   1 - 2 Liter camelback backpack with extra pockets
-   2 - Large tubes of SPF50 sun block ("White people unite!")
-   8 - Packages of assorted freeze dried food (just add boiling water!)
-   8 - Cans of Chili
-   8 - Trader Joe Curry Lentils and the like in foil packs
-   3 - Bags of assorted nuts

Already existing gear:

-   1 - Ticket to Burning Man, 2006.
-   1 - Tent that has never been the same since Burning Man 2001
-   1 - Questionable propane stove ("What's that smell? BOOM!")
-   1 - Sleeping bag, last laundry date a mystery
-   1 - Old pillow
-   1 - Boonie Hat
-   1 - Filter mask
-   1 - Titanium fork/soon set
-   1 - Small cooler (but what to put in it?)
-   1 - Steel teapot
-   1 - micro-espresso maker (just boil water in it and watch it perk)
-   1 - Pair of rather beat up ol' Doc Martens with replacements waiting
    at home
-   1 - Utilikilt, black
-   4 - Plastic tubs with snap on lids, some still coated in five year
    old playa dust

What am I missing? I could probably use more food but everything I have
can either be eaten directly or with boiled water. I will be there
Wednesday through Monday morning and I will be bringing 21 gallons of
water, so I should be good there. I need to figure out where to fill the
water unless I want to hall that much water from the Bay Area.
