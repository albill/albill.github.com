Tonight, R and I watch **Weird Science** (which she, not I, selected) on
the DVD player. Our cable box has been non-functional since last week's
snowstorm turned out power off overnight (I think the magic smoke got
out) so we had to rent something if we want to do more than read and
other projects. Lack of TV isn't a bad thing really... Anyhoo, I'd
forgotten how amusing yet dorky that movie is. Anthony Michael Hall is
his prime (unlike Mr. No-Neck in Edward Scissorhands). I saw it in the
theatre as a pre-teen. Lots of bad 80s hair and clothes though.
