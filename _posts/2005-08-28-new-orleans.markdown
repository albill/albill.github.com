<p>As people may recall, R and I are going to Thailand on September 23 for two weeks. This was our second choice after some consideration a month ago. Originally, we were going to go to New Orleans for a week during the same period (for our first anniversary).</p><p>Right now, I can only be glad that we chose Thailand. We couldn't have forseen the hurricane. I wonder how it will go tomorrow. I expect that the world will know.&nbsp;</p>
