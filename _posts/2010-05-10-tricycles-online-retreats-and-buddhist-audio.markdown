Through [Tricycle magazine's website](http://www.tricycle.com/), Stephen
Batchelor has been running an "online retreat" called "[Buddhism for
this One and Only
Life](http://www.tricycle.com/online-retreats/buddhism-one-and-only-life)."
This seems to consist largely of video presentations by him, rather than
some of more interactive online retreats that I've seen from some Zen
teachers. Examples of teachers doing such things are [Dosho
Port](http://wildfoxzen.blogspot.com/) or [Jundo
Cohen](http://www.treeleaf.org/), who are both doing a lot of good work.
Tricycle wants one to be a subscriber in order to watch the videos so
I've only seen the first one, which is free. I found it interesting
enough to suggest to others as something to spend 25 minutes watching
and you can see it
[here](http://www.tricycle.com/online-retreats/buddhism-one-and-only-life/awakening-life-awakening-death).
I see that Ken McLeod is also running a Tricycle online retreat, [The
Way to Freedom](http://www.tricycle.com/online-retreats/way-freedom-0).
You can see the first video
[here](http://www.tricycle.com/online-retreats/way-freedom/way-freedom-week-1)
for free as well. ("*Hey kid, the first one's free...*") Given how much
free content, even from both of these teachers, there is online, I'm not
sure if there is much reason to pay for a Tricycle subscription or
access unless one is interested in Tricycle magazine. I've generally
found it of only marginal interest but I find a lot of the content
produced by the Buddhist media in America to be targeted at a much
different audience (\*cough\* *aging boomers* \*cough\*) than me and,
therefore, pretty boring, often bringing the opposite of awakening. Ken
McLeod has an ongoing, very good, podcast
[available](http://www.unfetteredmind.org/audio/) that includes audio
from many of the retreats that he teachers. He comes at things from the
perspective of the Vajrayana. Stephen Batchelor did a retreat recently
at [Upaya Zen Center](http://www.upaya.org). You can find the audio
online
[here](http://www.upaya.org/dharma/tag/godless-religion-or-devout-atheism/)
for it. Upaya Zen Center maintains a [vast
archive](http://www.upaya.org/dharma/) of audio material from their
retreats as well, which you can subscribe to as a podcast. I've found
their content to be exceptional as well.
