<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/internet/11/24/spam.rage.reut/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/internet/11/24/spam.rage.reut/index.html</a> A Silicon Valley computer programmer has been arrested for threatening to torture and kill employees of the company he blames for bombarding his computer with Web ads promising to enlarge his penis. <i><b>[A representative of the firm] said his firm does not send spam but blamed a rival firm which he said routes much of their unsolicited bulk e-mail through Russia and eastern Europe. Mackay said such firms gave a bad name to the penis enhancement business.</b></i>
