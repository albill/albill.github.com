Today, people are getting ready for <a href="http://air.mozilla.com/">Air Mozilla</a>, which goes live tomorrow at 2:00 PM PDT. We'll be doing live streaming with a variety of people.

Asa <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2007/07/relaunch_of_air.html">blogged about this</a> the other day and was used as a test dummy as systems were calibrated and tested end to end today.

Below, you can see Reed and Asa testing out the equipment. These were such endearing shots of two geeks that I decided that I had to share them...

I encourage everyone to tune in tomorrow if you have a chance.
