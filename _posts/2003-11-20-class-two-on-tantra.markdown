R and I attended the second "Tantra" class tonight.

(I put it in quotes not out of disrespect but because it doesn't match the normal, Buddhist or Hindu, definition of Tantra...more of a Neo-Tantra...)

The class went fairly well. Again, it was just the two of us and a third person with the instructor. He went over exercises to do with focusing and expanding the senses to encompass more of the "subtle" end of the spectrum and the Cobra breath. We also received some handouts for some puja work and pranayama. This class is helping to reinforce my desire to study the more sexual end of ritual works (including other Neo-Tantric and sex magic materials) so it is all good.

Next week is the last class in his short series.
