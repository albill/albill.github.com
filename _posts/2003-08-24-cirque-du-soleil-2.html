R and I went to see <strong>Alegria</strong> by the Cirque du Soleil here in the Seattle area on Friday night. We had phenomenal seats. We were in the 'A' row in the '103' section. This translates to us being, literally, six or seven feet from the corner of the stage. Close enough to just about reach out and touch the performers with only one other row of seats between us and them. This made a nice difference in the show in comparison to last year where we were further back. (Last year was great as well though!)

I actually haven't watched any of the footage from this show before with the exception of part of the strongman routine so it was all fresh for me. Many many acrobats and tumblers. Trampolines built into the stage that it unfolds to uncover. Some phenomenal trapeze work (where we were <em>directly</em> under the net beneath them) with something like six guys at once. Clowns as well, including some rather scarring ones.

As much as people like to complain about certain aspects of the Cirque as an organization and how its masters treat some of its people at times (there is a certain amount of back and forth on them), they are just amazing to see live. Well worth the rather hefty ticket fees!

Yesterday, we went to regulus' birthday bash with much of the local OTO that we know. They have a rather charming house in North Seattle and we got a chance to catch up with a bunch of people, including the creator of my favorite toy: my stuff two-headed bunny rabbit. We didn't stay late but had a great time. I received a nice Ptah statue as a belated birthday present as well as it had accidentally been left home on the day of my party. It's always cool to get nice ritual stuff.
