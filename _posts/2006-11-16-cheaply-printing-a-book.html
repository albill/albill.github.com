I'm interested in exploring the costs of cheaply printing a book. This is part of my thoughts around a Burning Man project.

The text in question is <a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/about.html">Dharma Dan's</a> <a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/mctb.html"><strong>Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha</strong></a>. If I wanted to give away copies of it, I'd like to print up a cheap edition to effectively give away as part of a Buddhist camp. There are other potential texts but this is a front runner because it focuses on core practice in a no-nonsense way. If there was a free text that just covered Shamatha and Vipassana to the same degree, I might do that instead.

The question is how to print up a lot of copies cheaply. I'd prefer something bound in some way with a cover so they could be given away for people to (hopefully) read.
