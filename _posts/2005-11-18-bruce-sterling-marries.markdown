Bruce Sterling is quietly getting married today according to
[BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/11/17/nice_day_for_a_cyber.html).
That's weird because, the last I heard, he had a wife and two daughters
in Austin. I can only assume that as part of his move to Los Angeles and
other life stuff, he must have gotten divorced. When he was out at my
work two years ago (or was it even that long) he spoke about his house
in Austin and his daughters so it seems recent.

Here is a Russian link to one of my favorite Bruce Sterling stories of
recent years: [Taklamakan](http://lib.ru/STERLINGB/taklamakan.txt)
