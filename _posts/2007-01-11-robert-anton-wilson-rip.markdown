I just learned from Douglas Rushkoff's <a href="http://www.rushkoff.com/2007/01/raw-unplugged.php">blog</a> that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson">Robert Anton Wilson</a> is dead.

I had read from Wilson himself that he was given between a few days and two months to live just the other day. His blog is at <a href="http://robertantonwilson.blogspot.com/">http://robertantonwilson.blogspot.com/</a>.

I remember reading all of RAW's books when I was a teenager and they had a profound impact on me. I never really cared much for his fiction (unlike many) but I found his essays and attitude to be spot on. While I hadn't followed his work closely in years, I know that he touched my life and the lives of most of the people that I've been friends with over the years.

So let's all remember Wilson and keep his attitude alive. I'm not sure that there will be another like him anytime soon.
