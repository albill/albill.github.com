I'm in luck. I thought that I had missed out on getting **Viridarium
Umbris** from Schulke because I hadn't preordered it a while back. It
turns out that Fields Books in San Francisco is the distributor of the
book for the west coast. I paid a slightly higher price but a copy of it
is on its way to me today. A description of the book:

> An extensive grimorium of Wortcunning, or herb-magic, the
> Pleasure-Garden treats of the secret knowledge of trees and herbs as
> delivered by the Fallen Angels unto mankind. The bookâ€™s principal
> concerns are the sorcery and gnosis of the Greenwood, as arising from
> the varied luminaries of the Eternal Gardens of the Arte Magical. As a
> grimoire of Spiritual Botany, the Book is a Hortus Conclusus of text
> and image intended for the indwelling of these plant-spirits. The work
> encompasses magical practices, formulae, and mystical exegesis, all
> treating the respective arcana of Nature-Spirits and the powers of
> individual plants. Much of the magical foci are on devotion, purity,
> humility, silence, solitude, and the hieros-gamos of wortcunner and
> plant as a tutelary relationship, in conjunction with the Mysteries of
> Cain, first tiller of the soil. The whole is intended as a textual
> reification of the Green Arts within the context of the Sabbatic Craft
> Tradition, and within the greater ambit of Brythonic plantlore and
> folk magic.
