To my few readers,

If you know of any excellent (not just good but excellent) tattoo artists in the Bay Area, let me know. Obviously the East Bay is preferable but, frankly, I expect that I'll have to go into San Francisco for any excellent work. Since a bunch of you are tattooed freaks and local, I figure you must know someone good.
