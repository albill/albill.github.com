I've finished Day 4 on the job but I'm going away for the rest of a week. I have a trip that was planned before I was hired to go to Ohio.

It looks like I'll be working with Juan on the next 2.0.0.x release, when it occurs, along with some of the Firefox 3 QA efforts. I'll probably post a bit more when I have something of substance to add...
