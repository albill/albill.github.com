Yes, there are a few gestures that can be used. I hesitate to convey
them because of their power as they are deeply ingrained in the Western
psyche. As with any gesture of projection, one must be willing and
capable to handle any forces marshalled against one in response after
such a gesture is used. There is a secret technique handed down and it
is done in this way: First one fixes thy eye upon the hostile entity.
Ones intention must also be fixed with increasing martial energy surging
through thy body and soul. It should be such that thy hairs stand upon
end. Unless this be fact, one is best to turn and flee rather than
continue. Holding thy body firm, raise thy Right arm in a continuous
motion upward in a sweep, palm down, finishing with a quick flip
outwards to where the palm is facing you. In one swift movement, clinch
the fingers of thy hand into a fist, leaving the middle one extended.
This is of course aimed at the hostile entity. One may work with this
gesture to further elaborations wherein the hand is not completely in a
fist but the other fingers just bent at the joints. However, this is a
matter of personal style developed by the magician. If however the
hostile entity is weak of eyesight or of questionable intelligence, it
is sometimes necessary to combine the magical gesture with a verbal
exclamation. Because of its several and sometimes contradictory meanings
I must refrain from disclosing it. Suffice it to say, I will reveal and
conceal it: it is a twofold phrase, representing duality; a sevenfold
combination of letters, representing the whole soul; the first word
being a sharp retort ending in a consonant, the second a long vowel
sound. More than this I cannot say. This gesture should be used with
reserve. And it is warned that if used, one must be willing to handle
any further hostile action from the entity with even more practical
means.
