![Warlord of
Mars](http://www.arcanology.com/images/warlord_of_mars.jpg)I mentioned
my love of Barsoom, the pulp Mars of Edgar Rice Burroughs before but did
not give any links to his books. The first five of them are in the
public domain in the United States and are available on [Project
Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org).

1.  [A Princess of Mars](http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/62)
2.  [Gods of Mars](http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/64)
3.  [Warlord of Mars](http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/68)
4.  [Thuvia, Maid of Mars](http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/72)
5.  [The Chessmen of Mars](http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1153)

As it turns out, the rest of them are available on [Project Gutenberg of
Australia](http://gutenberg.net.au/), where the copyright laws are
different and the later books are in public domain.

6.  [The Mastermind of
    Mars](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks01/0100201.txt)
7.  [A Fighting Man Of
    Mars](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks01/0100211.txt)
8.  [Swords of Mars](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks01/0100221.txt)
9.  [Synthetic Men of
    Mars](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks01/0100231.txt)
10. [Llana of Gathol](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks01/0100241.txt)
11. [John Carter and the Giant of
    Mars](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0600581.txt)
12. [John Carter and the Skeleton Men of
    Jupiter](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0600591.txt)

These last two were outside of the main corpus and published very late
in Burroughs' life. In addition, there is his Venus series, similar but
unrelated in connecting details. This is mostly available as well.

1.  [Pirates of Venus](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0300211h.html)
    (text only [here](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0300211.txt))
2.  [Lost on Venus](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0300201h.html)
3.  [Carson of Venus](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0300181h.html)
4.  [Escape on Venus](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0300191h.html)
5.  The Wizard of Venus (published late and not available online)

If you have the time and inclination, I recommend the Mars series
especially. Flying airships, strange and ancient science (aka magic),
swords, monsters, manly men...
