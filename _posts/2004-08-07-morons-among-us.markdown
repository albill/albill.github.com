And I laughed and laughed and laughed...

[Psychic Vampire Codex: A Manual of Magick and Energy
Work](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1578633214/)

As a member of a spiritual minority and an unabashed freak for weird
religious thought, is it a bad thing that I look at this book and can't
stop laughing? Where did my acceptance of other people's weird ideas go?
Of course, on the other hand, only an utter moron would buy this work...
