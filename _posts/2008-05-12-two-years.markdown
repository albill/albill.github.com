I realized today that it had been two years, to the day, since I quit
Microsoft. In most ways, it doesn't seem like it has been quite that
long but in others, it has. This means that we'll have been living in
the Bay Area for two years next month as well. I still miss the trees,
fog, and chilly rain though.
