I just found out that Open Circle Theatre is presenting more
Lovecraftian horror in their live show. Last year, R and I went and saw
their production of three short pieces (with puppets!), which included
the Color out of Space.

This year, they are performing three short pieces again as part of a
show: Nyarlathotep, The Doom that Came to Sarnath, and Dreams in the
Witch House.

I'd go tonight except R has been ill since we got back from our trip.
