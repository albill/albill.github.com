[According to
Reuters](http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ijDA5bgxiHlTvS_r-SSjskS1Tq1wD8VG3BKO4),
Sir [Arthur C. Clarke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke)
died today. The [Clarke Foundation](http://www.clarkefoundation.org)
does not currently have a notice of it up but they do have a
[biography](http://www.clarkefoundation.org/acc/biography.php) page for
him for those unfamiliar with his work. Clarke was on the shortlist of
science fiction authors that I read as a child. I remember reading
books, [**The Fountains of
Paradise**](http://www.amazon.com/Fountains-Paradise-Arthur-C-Clarke/dp/0446677949)
and [**Childhood's
End**](http://www.amazon.com/Childhoods-End-Arthur-C-Clarke/dp/0345347951),
very early on. Out of his work, the latter probably had the most impact
on me. Another early memory of mine is my mother taking me to see a
showing of **2001: A Space Odyssey** (which he wrote the original story
for) at her university. I was probably all of five years old at the
time. Authors like Clarke, Asmiov, and Silverberg all stand in a special
place in my childhood memories as those that introduced me to science
fiction in a major way (alongside Edgar Rice Burroughs and H.P.
Lovecraft for my childhood fiction influences). His [three
laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws), especially the
third, are often quoted today in a variety of circumstances:

1.  When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is
    possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that
    something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
2.  The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture
    a little way past them into the impossible.
3.  Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from
    magic.

His passing saddens me but he was not a young man. I'll ponder his gifts
to us as an author whenever I look at my bookshelves.
