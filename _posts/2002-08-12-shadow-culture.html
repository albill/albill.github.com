This is from <a href="http://www.adbusters.org/magazine/43/articles/shadow_culture.html">http://www.adbusters.org/magazine/43/articles/shadow_culture.html</a>. While I do not agree with all of it (or exemplify it at least since I own a newish car and such), it strikes a chord with me just as Daniel Quinn's work does.

<strong>Shadow Culture</strong>
<em>by James MacKinnon</em>

1 Manifesto (in progress):

2 When we talk about "the system," it sounds like warmed-over Marx. But then, who can deny that there is "a system"? Am I right?

3 So, the system. The system can absorb almost every act of protest. Violence, for example. The system absorbs violence quite nicely, thank you. Almost without a bump.

4 Still.

5 The system is very poorly equipped to handle certain changes. Such as: it doesn't cope well with less.

6 That is, people who ask less, not more, of the system. People who do not contribute to "growth." Who don't go to the doctor that often, or take in a lot of movies, or consider a three-blade razor an improvement on a two-blade.

7 The act of asking for less, not more, is a radical act – far more radical than it's ever given credit for.

8 If you don't believe me, ask yourself why, after modern history's most appalling act of terrorism, the President of the united States of America would tell his people to keep on shopping or the terrorists win.

9 Here's why: consumption keeps the system standing. Take away consumption, and you need to come up with a radically different system.

10 That said, dropping out and joining a commune is volunteering to put your ideas in quarantine. And besides, communes tend to be a bit heavy on the rules. A tad monolithic.

11 We do not live in communes because we refuse to cede the culture. We prefer to be within the culture, a disturbance.

12 We are in the process of imagining the next civilization while living within the existing one. To use a short-memory metaphor, we are the digital revolutionaries tinkering in the garage in 1979. Not the guys who always dreamed of being what Bill Gates became, but the tinkerers who proved, again, that the key component of advance in any sphere – innovation – plainly does not depend on private interest and ownership and the exchange of paper money.

13 The on-line coupon salesmen and naked-on-my-webcam people came later.

14 So, we are inventing a way of life with less. We are asking the following question: Take away consumerism. What does the next culture look like?

15 To be honest, we don't have an answer. If this were the high-tech revolution, we would be at the stage, maybe, of the digital calculator.

16 Which is as good a time as any to explain what I mean by "we." We, I think, are the people who are rapidly losing the last remnants of interest in home theaters, multiple-car ownership, fast food, big-box retail, the Philip Stark toothbrush, all that. Or at least, most of it. We all have our small fetishes, our weaknesses, our chosen luxuries. Mine is travel. Yours, maybe, is your low-rider '82 Chevy Nova.

17 But I don't want to make this sound easy. This is not a lifestyle preference, though it is undeniably a life-style choice.

18 We are choosing, for example, to ride bicycles in a traffic system that threatens our lives, in weather that makes us miserable, over distances that make us tired. We do this because we are conscientious objectors to automotive culture and its environmental and social costs. When enough people reject the auto-cult, a better system will emerge – public transport, cities with a smarter design. In the meantime, we ride our bikes whether we like to or not.

19 Except for the guy who can't give up his low-rider '82 Chevy Nova. But he's in a radical car-pool.

20 Another example. There is something called the pooh-rag system, in which you tear rags into small sheets to use in lieu of toilet paper. You place the used rags in a large jug of vinegar. When the jug is full, you take it to the laundromat and put the contents through a low-water wash cycle so the rags can be used again. There's nothing pleasant about this, but there's nothing charming about wiping your ass with old-growth forests, either.

21 Anyway . . .

22 . . . it isn't only about stuff. It's also about, say, living outside the entertainment pipeline of TV and Hollywood. Fumbling towards forgotten forms of leisure, or inventing new ones. Like protest.

23 Have you noticed? Many people in the mainstream media think global justice protests are just some kind of party.

24 They act like we should apologize for that.

25 Instead, the greatest danger is that we will let ourselves fall within their limits, their peculiar options for acceptable change, each one built on the idea of more – more for Bangladesh and Haiti, but more, too (and always, and ever-more), for Beverly Hills and Canary Wharf.

26 We say no. No thanks.

27 We say "no" with our selves. We are the people, sitting on a porch, sharing a meal at mid-day, asking a great deal from each other but little from the earth or from the state – less and less of its schools and shopping malls, its trade rules and tax regimes. We are the people who, as you walk by on your way to a job you hate, serve to remind that there are other ways to live, and that you can join in the imperfect search. And that searching itself is not a bad way to live.

28 In time, we will find signs and pointers towards a new culture, and we'll begin to live it from beneath, on the fringe, in the shadow.

29 A shadow culture.
