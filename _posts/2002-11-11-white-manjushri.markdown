I attended the White Manjushri at the <a href="http://www.sakya.org">Sakya Monastery</a> tonight. It was sponsored by the Medicine Dharma Reiki people that I mentioned before along with another empowerment the other day that I was able to go to. I got chatting with some of them after the empowerment (which went well, by the way) about Lama Gursam. He just completed his three year retreat earlier this year and seems to be a go-getter. One of the people mentioned that he was a Ngakpa of some sort now and that he'd given up his monastic vows (it seems) after the three year retreat. The person seemed a bit unclear about details but knew that Lama Gursam wasn't a celibate anymore and the person was wondering why Lama Gursam was wearing his monastic robes this evening based on that. An interesting note.

I did like the Lama quite a bit. I'm told that the White Manjushri empowerment isn't very commonly given, which is why they brought him here so I'm glad that I got exposed to it. I received a concise sadhana translated a couple of years ago and I'm curious as to whether there are any other sadhanas or supplementary documents available. I did notice that this form of Manjushri, unlike the others that I've seen, does not hold a sword as his implement. Instead, in each of his two hands, he holds a flower. One is blue and one is white.
