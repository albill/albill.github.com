<p>I read this article this evening since it was recommended in the course of a 
conversation about the plagues that swept the Americas after European contact 
occured. Most people are aware that disease killed a lot of native peoples. Most 
people are <b>not</b> aware that disease probably killed somewhere between 90% 
to 98% of the native peoples. The &quot;new world&quot; was far from unpopulated when the 
ancestors of most of us showed up. How big that population was is open to a bit 
of debate. Not exactly the empty wilderness of childhood schools though.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>&quot;Before it became the New World, the Western Hemisphere was vastly more 
	populous and sophisticated than has been thought, an altogether more 
	salubrious place to live at the time than, say, Europe. New evidence of both 
	the extent of the population and its agricultural advancement leads to a 
	remarkable conjecture: the Amazon rain forest may be largely a human 
	artifact&quot;</p>

<p>Another interesting point, not mentioned in this article, is that it could 
all very easily happen again, especially given the interconnection in our global 
society.</p>
