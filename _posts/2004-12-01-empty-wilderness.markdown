I read this article this evening since it was recommended in the course
of a conversation about the plagues that swept the Americas after
European contact occured. Most people are aware that disease killed a
lot of native peoples. Most people are **not** aware that disease
probably killed somewhere between 90% to 98% of the native peoples. The
"new world" was far from unpopulated when the ancestors of most of us
showed up. How big that population was is open to a bit of debate. Not
exactly the empty wilderness of childhood schools though.

Another interesting point, not mentioned in this article, is that it
could all very easily happen again, especially given the interconnection
in our global society.
