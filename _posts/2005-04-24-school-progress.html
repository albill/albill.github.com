<p>I&#39;ve finished my first term of my graduate program at
<a href="http://www.csudh.edu/hux/">California State University, Dominguez Hills</a>.</p>
<p>This term was focused on required classes for the program so I took my 
graduate level introduction to History and the introduction to Philosophy 
classes. I don&#39;t know what my final grades will be yet but I received &#39;A&#39;s on 
all of my papers up to the final ones. Those were just turned in in the last 
week. For one class, the last paper is only 25% of my grade but it was 40% for 
the other. I&#39;m not too worried about it overall though.</p>
<p>Next term is the Summer Trimester. I&#39;ll be taking my last introductory class, 
this one on Literature. It looks like papers on Joseph Conrad, James Joyce, and 
others. The other class is a World Religions class. Frankly, while writing the 
papers may take time, I think that class will be a cakewalk. I want to do well 
in it for an additional reason. The professor for the class, Dr. Hagan, is one 
of the most experienced professors in the program and his published work centers 
on religious studies and philosophy of religion. I&#39;m considering having him be 
my advisor for my thesis if things go well and I want to make a good impression. 
Out of the classes that I just finished, one of the professors there offered to 
advise me but only within a strict set of subject matter. </p>
<p>Overall, the program hasn&#39;t been too bad. I know how to write tolerably well 
and I read quickly so I am able to usually keep up with the work. Doing all of 
the reading and writing after work makes for the difficult week when papers are 
due but I expected that to be the case. It is difficult sometimes to feel the 
motivation after work but then I remember how much I hated coming home from 
work, feeling like I did nothing special for the evening, and then going back to 
work the next day. This helps me feel like I am accomplishing something.</p>
<p>It is getting in the way of some of my Buddhist stuff. There is a shedra (a 
kind of school) being organized by Khachab Rinpoche that I would love to 
participate in. He&#39;s allowing remote students and he&#39;s doing a three year 
program. He teaches every week and it is recorded in mp3 for non-local students. 
They are working through quite few texts. I don&#39;t think that I really have the 
time to get involved with it right now because of my degree work. I also still 
want to learn Tibetan but I think that will not be happening for a couple of 
years.</p>
<p>Right now, the biggest thing on my mind for school is figuring out if I am on 
the Philosophy track or the History track. Which one it is will determine a 
number of my fall courses. Because my interests fall between the two and because 
there is no religious studies program, I&#39;m going to have to make some decisions 
soon.</p>
