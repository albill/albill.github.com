So, on Saturday, R had her killer software certification test from Hell.
Apparantly, she's appalled, which you can read about on her journal. The
whole thing sounds like a certification nightmare to me. Given the
amount of time that she worked on it, it's more than a little irritating
for her (and by extension, me!). I ran around doing errands on Saturday
and bought Madeline gifts for her birthday on the 22nd. She'll be seven
and I wanted to avoid just giving her more crap. The final take was:

-   A 9-in-1 Game Chest (including chinese checkers, shoots and ladders,
    chess, memory matching, etc.)
-   A copy of **Battleship** (which I think we all remember from
    childhood)
-   Some outfits for her barbies
-   Some grade appropriate learning games software that actualy looked
    pretty good to help her read and such
-   A Spirograph Studio kit (full of cool spirograph goodies)
-   A Powerpuff Girls DVD of a bunch of episodes

All in all, it seems to be money decently spent. Later on, I took out to
dinner at Atlas Foods over by the U Village. Then I surprised her by
proposing to her! heh. Apparantly, it turns out that I've made a lot of
general anti-marriage remarks over the last couple of years so it was a
bit of a surprise. The downside is that the jeweler said that there is a
good chance that her ring won't be ready by the time we leave for Greece
(and if it is, it will be a day or two before we leave) so I had to use
a non-standard proxy ring. (No, I won't discuss what her ring is like
until she gets it!!) She's had this dazed look for the last couple of
days now. ;-)
