So, on Saturday, R had her killer software certification test from Hell. Apparantly, she&apos;s appalled, which you can read about on her journal. The whole thing sounds like a certification nightmare to me. Given the amount of time that she worked on it, it&apos;s more than a little irritating for her (and by extension, me!).

I ran around doing errands on Saturday and bought Madeline gifts for her birthday on the 22nd. She&apos;ll be seven and I wanted to avoid just giving her more crap. The final take was:<ul><li>A 9-in-1 Game Chest (including chinese checkers, shoots and ladders, chess, memory matching, etc.)</li><li>A copy of <b>Battleship</b> (which I think we all remember from childhood)</li><li>Some outfits for her barbies</li><li>Some grade appropriate learning games software that actualy looked pretty good to help her read and such</li><li>A Spirograph Studio kit (full of cool spirograph goodies)</li><li>A Powerpuff Girls DVD of a bunch of episodes</li></ul>All in all, it seems to be money decently spent.

Later on, I took  out to dinner at Atlas Foods over by the U Village. Then I surprised her by proposing to her! heh. Apparantly, it turns out that I&apos;ve made a lot of general anti-marriage remarks over the last couple of years so it was a bit of a surprise. The downside is that the jeweler said that there is a good chance that her ring won&apos;t be ready by the time we leave for Greece (and if it is, it will be a day or two before we leave) so I had to use a non-standard proxy ring. (No, I won&apos;t discuss what her ring is like until she gets it!!)

She&apos;s had this dazed look for the last couple of days now. ;-)
