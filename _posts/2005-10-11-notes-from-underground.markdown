My current focus is getting caught up in school right now. I haven't
been reading blogs as much because of this.

I'm currently writing a paper on humanism and rationality in
Dostoevsky's **Notes from Underground**. This was due last Friday. After
this, I have a paper on political autonomy and the individual for my
other class but that one is fairly short.
