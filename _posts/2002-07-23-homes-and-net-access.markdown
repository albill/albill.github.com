So, my phone line didn't get installed correctly yesterday. The Qwest
guys had to come out today and fix something. They say it will work now.
I'll see when I get home though... I did order DSL this afternoon so we
should have high speed access at home by end of day on the 31st. I'm
going to go with [serv.net](http://www.serv.net) here in Seattle as told
me that I can get static IP addresses through them so that will make
things easier for R and myself. R moved her stuff into the house today.
It sounds like it was five hours of Hell though. On the bright side, we
have a couch in the house now. ;-) I'm about to bail from work where I
have full access. I'm grabbing a print out of instructions on how to
make distillation equipment and heading home to unpack. It will probably
take a couple of weeks to get everything out of boxes.
