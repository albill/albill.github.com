So, my phone line didn't get installed correctly yesterday. The Qwest guys had to come out today and fix something. They say it will work now. I'll see when I get home though... I did order DSL this afternoon so we should have high speed access at home by end of day on the 31st. I'm going to go with <a href="http://www.serv.net">serv.net</a> here in Seattle as told me that I can get static IP addresses through them so that will make things easier for R and myself.

R moved her stuff into the house today. It sounds like it was five hours of Hell though. On the bright side, we have a couch in the house now. ;-)

I'm about to bail from work where I have full access. I'm grabbing a print out of instructions on how to make distillation equipment and heading home to unpack. It will probably take a couple of weeks to get everything out of boxes.
