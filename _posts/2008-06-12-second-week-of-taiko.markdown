R and I just finished our second class at <a href="http://www.etaiko.org">Emeryville Taiko</a>, our local Taiko dojo.

We're both really enjoying the classes but they really wipe us out, physically. I've spent too long riding a desk and not enough out and exercising. I knew this and had been taking some steps to counteract this and be more active, but clearly I'm not used to this level of exercise. We spend about 20 minutes stretching, warming up, and doing some physical exercises and we bang on those drums for more than an hour doing drills and the like. By the time we're done, my legs are on fire from the stance and the sweat is just rolling off of me. If I did this all the time, I'd be carved out of wood or something.

I expect that I will get used to it and it will become easier. This isn't a complaint, mind you, just an observation on how physically draining the classes are for me. As I said, we're both really enjoying this and I love the drums and what I know of the music. I'm looking forward to continuing this. R and I agreed to give it three months and then to see how we were feeling about it then.

Going to a new class after work, especially one like this, requires us to fight our bad habits and inertia. Like many married couples, we often wind up just spending a lot of time at home in the evenings but I know that I'm happier when I get out a bit, even if I don't want to do it every night.

I still don't know how I feel about performing but we're a long way from that point so it isn't an immediate worry.
