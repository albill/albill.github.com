I mentioned yesterday, I attended the [SF in SF](http://www.sfinsf.org/)
gathering in San Francisco this evening. (Well, it is almost 1:30 AM but
you know what I mean...). [Cory Doctorow](http://www.craphound.com/) and
[Rudy Rucker](http://www.rudyrucker.com) both read from their work and
then did a question and answer panel with Terry Bisson following their
readings. It was quite fun and I enjoyed hearing both of them read and
the panel discussion. I'd never met Cory in person before though he and
a number of other current writers and thinkers are people that I follow
online (such as my undying fanboi love for Bruce Sterling...). I'd met
Rudy once before when he was with Bruce Sterling at CCA last September.
Be sure to listen to some of the amusing moments in the Q&A where, for
example, our panelists are asked to discuss what their third leg may be
or Cory discusses his reaction to the idea of his upcoming book,
**Little Brother**, getting him into hot water. With the permission of
everyone involved, I recorded the whole thing and I've put it up on the
Internet Archive as a public domain recording. This can be found
[here](http://www.archive.org/details/SFinSF_Cory_Doctorow_and_Rudy_Rucker)
along with a couple of photos that I took. Since it was just over two
hours long, I removed from of the miscellaneous breaks between sessions
and did a light cleanup of the audio before converting it to three
different tracks. I uploaded 256kbps files, which are quite large.
Sometime in the next day, the Internet Archive should automatically try
to create much lower bitrate versions of the files. I'm linking to the
large files below but check the [home
page](http://www.archive.org/details/SFinSF_Cory_Doctorow_and_Rudy_Rucker)
for the media files later if you want smaller ones.

**Update:** The lower bitrate feeds are up. I've updated the links to
point towards the variable bitrate files, which are much saner in size.
