The first draft of my second (of three) papers for my **Individual and
Society** class was completed by me today. That only took me most of
today and much of yesterday but I was probably only working 50% on it
with other things going on both days. That leaves me one to go, which I
may start on tomorrow.

I think I've had enough reading about utopias for a while. I feel like I
should go read some William Gibson to compensate but then I always did
like the Panther Moderns.

For the final paper in the **Para-Rational Perspectives** class, the
professor also mentioned in his e-mail earlier today that I could turn
it in by e-mail by the seventh, rather than the second, though earlier
is better. Not having to physically mail this one means that I'm not in
quite as much of a time crunch to do it. That's all good news.
