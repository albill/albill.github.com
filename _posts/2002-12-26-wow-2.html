I get a lot of work done on my site when I'm sitting around here...

I just added <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/crowley-harris.html">Correspondence between Aleister Crowley and Frieda Harris</a> (concerning the Thoth Tarot).

I'm adding a collection of Crowley's Simon Iff stories as we speak as well. I've been meaning to put them up for a while <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/simon_iff/">here</a>.

Sooner or later I'm going to add something that gets me a stern letter from someone. It gets difficult when the order publishes stuff (online and off) and then tells everyone, years later, that it can no longer be published. <em>De Arte Magica</em> comes to mind here... Of course, I know of about a dozen places where the old pamphlets of it are still for sale.
