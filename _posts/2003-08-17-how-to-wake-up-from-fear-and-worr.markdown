This is from Kilung Rinpoche, who is the Seattle area Buddhist teacher that I started working with a few months ago. He's a Nyingma lama who lives in Seattle for part of the year. This was given in November of 2001 on the two month anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.
<hr width="50%" /><strong>How to Wake Up from Fear and Worry
Advice from a Tibetan Lama in Response to September 11</strong><em>A Talk by Kilung Tulku Tsultrim Rinpoche, Head of the Kilung Monastery in Eastern Tibet</em>

Most people of the earth felt the events of September 11. I was in Singapore and heard the news on television. At the same time, I received a phone call from Tibet with the news that on exactly the same day a very kind and high lama in Tibet had passed away. That created an additional connection for me. How interesting to think about coincidences like this. These events underscore the teaching of impermanence, how everything is changeable.

<img src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/kilung_rinpoche.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="216" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="213" />Looking outside at the fall weather, we can see impermanence and change. One moment it's warm, then cold, then windy, then warm again. Like autumn weather, the human condition is very changeable. We can be very happy one moment and very sad the next, then happy again. Yet, we need and want to continue living without being so reactive or subject to changing emotions. Tibetans have a lot of experience since the 1950's about change and impermanence. The Tibetan people lost homes, belongings, family and friends. It can be helpful to us now, considering the events of September 11, to look at how the Tibetan people dealt with these losses. Some Tibetan people, especially the older ones, still suffer. They have never re-engaged with their interests of daily life. Other people have rebounded and become active in life again. There are so many different ways of dealing with the feelings. It's best to be able to shake off the feelings of loss, like shaking dirt off of clothes, and appreciate what life offers in the present. Otherwise, the loss becomes a great obscuration to us.

It might seem like the September 11 tragedy was felt only in the United States, but this is not true. Thinking globally, people in the United States, especially younger people, do not have much experience with such tragedy. In this way, it is easy to feel alone with the pain. However, the greater part of the world has experience with tragedy and loss. With the events of September 11, many people came together with help and prayers. In Nepal, where I was, everyone was talking about what happened. The monks at Kilung Monastery did prayers as did many monks and lamas at other locations. It's like the world came together with a single mind, one of aspiring to the good. <lj-cut text="Read the rest if you wish..."></lj-cut>

It's easy to consume our minds with asking how something as awful as September 11 could have happened. It's easy to be angry. It's best not to create so much anger, disappointment, and sadness. In the face of tragedy, there is a moment of great sadness, true. However, even in the face of great tragedies it's better to think about how to create benefit. Different persons will have different views of how to create this benefit-it won't be the same for two persons. This is not to ignore the tragedy, rather to remember that for those of us remaining, we are still alive. We can do many great things.

After a tragedy, sometimes the shock is like being asleep. For example, in Tibet in the 1950's, the people had much sleepy energy. They could not think clearly. People felt unable to practice [the Dharma]. Everything slowed down and many things stopped. It's important to wake up, though ­ to participate in life.

After a tragedy, it's best to invoke the stronger aspect of ourselves ­ to help ourselves think of the best things for helping ­ and not to be so sleepy. There are so many things we can do:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Pray.</strong> We can pray for everyone in those buildings [that were attacked] and on those airplanes. We can extend those prayers for all beings to have happiness. I was in Nepal at the time and was fortunate to be able to contact my monastery in Tibet. The people there offered a great number of prayers.</li>
	<li><strong>Wake up.</strong> We can make sure we wake up</li>
	<li><strong>Become aware of what's important.</strong> What is important? What can lead to benefit? Think of children quarreling over a piece of candy. The piece of candy seems more important than it really is. As adults, we have our versions of quarreling over a piece of candy. Thinking of what's important can help us direct our energy to healing rather than quarreling. What would really benefit? Maybe we can share the piece of candy.</li>
	<li> <strong>Speak up or write letters.</strong> In the United States, people have the freedom to talk, to write letters to the government. People in the U.S. People in the U.S. are fortunate to be able to do this. This is not possible in all countries.</li>
</ul>
It does take time to heal. We don't expect these tragedies. We are not prepared and the shock is great when tragedies like this occur. So, the feelings stay. To start, do an everyday activity that interests you. You may feel like that everyday activity is too small and doesn't help the world. The point is that it helps you become active again, to wake up from the sleepiness.

It's better not to have so much anger. In our Bainbridge group, one woman responded that it's difficult not to have so much anger. When we get angry, we need to ask ourselves, "Why am I angry?" "What is the source of the anger?" In the Buddhist concept, karma (cause and effect) is involved. Maybe it's our karmic turn to receive this tragedy. Responding with anger just keeps the karma of anger in motion. So, it's better not to respond with anger. It's important to consider what this country [the U.S.] has done to receive this tragedy.

No doubt, there's great suffering with the type of tragedy that occurred on September 11th. This type of tragedy happened to large extent in Tibet during the 1950's during the Chinese invasion. I didn't experience the Chinese invasion directly as I was not born yet. I have seen photos and heard the stories from family and friends. There was so much suffering. For many, there still is. There is much suffering in Afghanistan today ­ many people have no food or shelter. That's why it is important to ask ourselves how we can benefit the situation and what the truth is. If we think how the whole world is "like me," the separation decreases, there's less anger and more room for benefit. Having great anger keeps suffering alive.

It's interesting in the U.S. because the country is so big and powerful. On the one hand, the country is helping with food and relief. On the other hand, bombing.

Let's consider what comes up in the personal mind. When strong emotions come up, they tend to get stronger. The emotion can be peaceful, angry, or neutral. Whatever the emotion, it tends to get stronger. That's why it's important for us to ask ourselves what's best for human beings, for the earth. This helps counteract angry thoughts and moves our energy and activity in a beneficial direction.

When sad, it's better to be a bit active than lethargic. So, again, it's important to keep doing daily activities. Let yourself feel completely open and gently ask, "What's important?" This helps the healing. Start small and in the moment. For example, listen to music if that helps. Go for a walk. In days gone by, when kings were bored, they'd have dancers entertain them. Then they could "wake-up" and think more clearly. If you follow a spiritual tradition, this is a good time to pray and do practices of your tradition. Prayer and dedication of the merit of prayer are very powerful ways to transform a situation. Then, you can let go of the situation mentally. Otherwise, the situation seems like a big backpack on the mind ­ heavy! If you can take off the backpack, you can feel yourself get lighter. You can think lightly.

We are lucky. We are still alive. It's our turn to do good things. We can shake off the sleep and wake up. That's important ­ to wake up! Then it's easier to do some prayers. Otherwise, with we may feel that it's difficult to pray without hesitancy. We can work into thinking of compassion equally for all, not this side or that side. We can think of the whole earth undivided. This can be difficult, because we often think of the "big I" and "big You," which results in much separation. Instead, think intelligently of everyone on this earth being brothers and sisters. Think of Mother Earth and all her children, that we are all related as human beings. There's so much we can dedicate in prayer! This is just one example. That's not physical. Physically, we can think of no differences between "my" country and other country.

If we have understanding, awareness that is strong enough, intelligent enough, we can balance our thoughts without wanting to hurt those "on the other side" and taking care only of ourselves on "this side." That is one way to start thinking. Each of us can wake up our mind and clearly see how best to help and think. There's not so much difference between sides. Having an equal balance of feelings helps decrease pressure. We can be more balanced in our thoughts and actions. One's feelings and life are not so involved then with great disaster.

When the mind is sad, the body cannot respond. Then we get mentally involved. In Tibet, many people became mentally ill. They could not forget. Some people are still holding on to the suffering. The feelings are strong and powerful. It seems like big actions are needed to respond to the largeness of the tragedy, so we feel helpless. It's too much. Thinking and being involved mentally with the violence creates and holds negative emotions. This can make the situation worse and lead to ill health. So, it's important not to be so involved mentally.

After thousands die, it's important to make sure that we, who remain, are strong and happy. But if the mind is asleep and keeping negative thoughts, it's difficult. We need to think more strongly healthily. This is most important! We can be part of our own healing ­ we can do prayers and we can wake up.

Again, I want everyone to know how personally sorry I am. The whole world is feeling this. Sometimes we think only two countries are involved, the U.S. and Afghanistan. But the whole world is involved. In Nepal, on the 49th day after the tragedy (November 1 in Nepal, a full moon), we offered 2,000 candle lamps at the Great Stupa in Boudanath. I continue to do prayers.

<strong>Comments/Questions</strong>

<em>Question:</em> I felt very sleepy after September 11. I felt very alone, then stuck and unable to do things, like I was falling into a pit of depression. Four days ago, I was able to start moving again.

<em>Response from Rinpoche:</em> This is very good. You are coming back from this sleepiness very fast. You are healing quickly. Hopefully, you will continue to be happy.

<em>Question:</em> It seems like individuals need different amounts of time to wake up. How can we wake up without forcing it or going too fast?

<em>Response from Rinpoche:</em> Yes, it's important not to fight the sleepiness, not to push too hard. Thinking that one shouldn't have these thoughts doesn't help ­ it adds negative thoughts. If that happens, try to think about the situation less and less. Give yourself space. Try to be open and compassionate with yourself to wake up. If you're fighting with yourself, it's like your mind is split into two with each part fighting.

<em>Question:</em> I feel a lot of anger toward the U.S. now because of all the money spent on bombing Afghanistan when so many Afghani refugees need food and shelter.

<em>Response from Rinpoche:</em> Consider that everyone is thinking that they're doing the best activity. We probably can't stop everything. If we can write letters, that's very good. As a person, we can each still do something. But, if worry strikes again and again, that's not good. That creates unhappiness in one's mind. If there's a chance to say something, that's a good option. Otherwise, let the thought come up and let it go ­ don't hold onto the negativity.

<em>Question:</em> Practically, it comes to how to donate my $10. Should I give the money to Afghanistan or to the monastery to help rebuild it?

<em>Response from Rinpoche:</em> Afghanistan needs so much help now. There's so much suffering.

<em>Question:</em> How can I handle the fear, fear of the unknown? The fear of what's going to happen to world. What's the world going to be like in one year? Six months? Two years?
I'm not fearful of more attacks, but how the world's going to reaction and how the world will appear in the future? Will we be more united or separated? How can we be sure that our diversity doesn't separate us?

<em>Response from Rinpoche:</em> Yes, there's so much changing in the world. Many countries are used to this, but as a country, the U.S. may not have felt such a large tragedy since World War II. Especially the young people, they don't have experience of such change. All they know is freedom. This may be the first time to hear and feel fear. There's a saying in Tibet, that a spark on one's clothing makes one a bit sad, but when the spark burns through to the skin, ouch! So now, in the U.S., the feeling, the pain, is stronger. The tragedy really hit home. The spark has burned through to the skin. I think it's going to be OK, though. All people are looking to find benefit now.

<em>Question:</em> What if you find yourself in an immediate short-term situation of facing death? You find yourself realizing the truth of impermanence. For example, I was on an airplane the day before September 11 and realize that I could have been on one of the fateful airplanes on September 11. I have a spiritual practice and still wonder what thoughts should I have in this type of situation.

<em>Response from Rinpoche:</em> Try not to have so much fear. Focus on your spiritual path and what's dear to you, such as your family. Send love to your family. It's good if you don't fear dying; you'll probably have an easier time when you die. If you're fearful when facing death, it's important to decide to let go of what's in this life. You must decide that now is my time to die. Now, death is my journey, so it's time to focus on this journey. That will help you be more peaceful and comfortable. The truth is that we will die. It's very helpful not to have fear.

<em>Question:</em> How should I act when someone I know is dying?

<em>Response from Rinpoche:</em> It's almost the same way as dealing with your own death. Understand that person is dying; recognize that it's her time. There's nothing you can do to change that. Focus on helping that person be happy and peaceful. Be gentle and compassionate with your friend. These are such gifts. If you are far away and can't be present with the person, send prayers and positive thoughts to the person. Keep your mind clear and free of fear and worry.

<em>Question:</em> I'm a teacher working with 10-year old children. How can I best help them with the events of September 11?

<em>Response from Rinpoche:</em> Children can feel what the adults feel even without hearing comments. Children don't seem to carry as much anger as adults, but they can have fear. It's good for you, as a teacher, to respond to their questions in a calm way. You can bring up the topic and gently explore the children's reactions to decide whether to talk more or drop the subject. This gentle acknowledgment of the events can help the children relax.
