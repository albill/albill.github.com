I was re-uploading photos from the 2003 trip to Greece today. I found
one of the ones from Delphi. I'm sitting on a concrete marker (because
the original is in the museum) marking the location of the Omphalos at
Delphi. I'm not sure you are supposed to ride the Omphalos though.
Sarastro once made a comment about Apollo striking me dead for this...
