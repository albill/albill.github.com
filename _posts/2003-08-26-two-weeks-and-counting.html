In two weeks, I fly to Minneapolis to take the next step with the Astrum Sophia. I&apos;m pretty excited about that and looking forward to seeing a lot of people that I haven&apos;t seen since <b>last</b> September. Then I come back for two days and immediately turn around and fly to the East Coast for a week to attend a retreat with Namkhai Norbu and the Dzogchen Community. I&apos;ve been doing some prepatory reading around that as well and I&apos;m looking forward to making a more in-person connection to that tradition and its practice. Then I come back for a week and a half and R and I will then go down to the Bay Area to attend <i>Twilight Gathering</i> with Sam Webster and that whole crew of malcontents. I&apos;m kind of overwhelmed with how busy September will be. October will be a month of rest except that R and I plan to start some kind of yoga together then....
