So, we&apos;re stuck on Santorini for an extra day since the only boat to Crete doesn&apos;t go until Sunday afternoon (it&apos;s friday at 5:24 pm right now).

Today, we went out to the excavation of Acrotiri. This is the ancient city on the southwest corner of Santorini that was abandoned in 1623 BCE before an eruption of the volcano here buried it. There isn&apos;t a lot of detail to be seen at the site itself since it is an ongoing dig but it was interesting to see the layout in person and where all of the buildings were. 

We had wanted to visit the museum that had the finds from it but it was closed yesterday because of a strike (for the war, I assume). We found out when we were at the site today that the museum was open today only...so we came back and got to go through that as well. We saw all of the frescoes, pottery, and other artifacts from Acrotiri. That was quite cool.

Afterwards, we took a cable card ride down to the old port next to Thira and wandered the streets a bit. We&apos;ve had multiple recommendations for a nice and cheap (!) restaurant tonight from both other tourists and a local shop owner so we&apos;ll be going to Nikolas shortly.

I had fun this morning playing tag with our landlord. Office hours and such are a bit of a dream here. I understand a little better why some Europeans think Americans are so anal. They just kind of do their own thing here.

I did buy some worry beads for my mother, which she had asked for. I also saw a store full of Greek statues but it hasn&apos;t been open when I&apos;ve been there. It&apos;s all of the gods and such. It has a Pallas Athena that I know  would want... We&apos;ll see if it is open tomorrow.

Tomorrow, we&apos;re going on a boat ride out to the volcano and the hotsprings in the morning into the afternoon. It is a glass bottomed boat and it stops for a while at the hot springs so we can go swimming in it. In the late afternoon, we&apos;re going to rent mopeds and ride around the island. I want to try to visit the old Thira city ruins if possible.

Yay! Vacation!! I&apos;m ignoring the cost of things as much as possible but it hasn&apos;t been too bad overall. The hotels have been as cheap or cheaper than the states.
