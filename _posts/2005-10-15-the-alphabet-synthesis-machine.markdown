Wow, this is pretty cool. The Alphabet Synthesis Machine... From the
site at [http://alphabet.tmema.org/](http://alphabet.tmema.org/):

> The [Alphabet Synthesis Machine](http://alphabet.tmema.org/entry.html)
> is an interactive online artwork which allows one to create and evolve
> the possible writing systems of one's own imaginary civilizations. The
> abstract alphabets produced by the Machine can be downloaded as
> PC-format TrueType fonts, and are entered into a comprehensive
> [archive](http://alphabet.tmema.org/cgi-bin/archive.cgi) of user
> creations. The products of the Machine probe the liminal territories
> between familiarity and chaos, language and gesture.
