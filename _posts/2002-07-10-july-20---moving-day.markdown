So, for any of my unfortunate friends who have volunteered to help me move: I have reserved a truck for 9:00 AM the day of the move. I figure that people should show up at 9:30 (the truck rental is eight blocks from my apartment). So, 9:30 AM, July 20 at 1416 East Marion, #201. That's between 14th and 15th on East Marion (over east of Seattle U) for those that haven't come by my place before. Most of my stuff is books really and I have the 1.5 cubic foot boxes so they aren't super heavy. I have almost every boxed up already since I'll be out of town until the night of 7/18. It'll be something like 25 or so boxes of books, seven bookcases, a desk, a dresser, a futon sans frame and probably 15 boxes of misc crap. I'm moving my computer on my own. ;-) I've spoken to most of you already but please let me know if you'll be able to make it or not. I figure if we start at 9:30, we'll be done loading the truck by 10:30 (seriously) and will start unloading at the house by 11:00 or so. This should be a fairly quick move. The address of the house is 9623 Roosevelt Way NE. It's the corner of 97th and Roosevelt just south of Northgate Mall. E-mail me at memoria@memoria.com to confirm or with questions.
