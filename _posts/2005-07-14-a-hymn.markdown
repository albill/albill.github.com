## *[Corpus Hermeticum XIII, 17 -
29](http://www.hermetic.com/texts/hermetica/hermes13.html)*

â€¦ Tat requests of Hermes to relay the hymn he heard while\
in the Ogdoad by the Powers praising God.

Let every substance of the world receive the sound of the hymn.\
 Earth, be open;\
 Let every bolt of the rain be open to me.\
 Trees, be still.\
 I am going to praise the Lord of creation,\
 Both the All and the One.\
 Heavens, be open,\
 And, winds, stand still.\
 Let the immortal circle of God receive my word.\
 For I am going to praise him who created all things,\
 The One who established the earth\
 And suspended heaven,\
 Who ordered the fresh water to go from the ocean\
 To the inhabited and uninhabited regions\
 For the sustenance and creation\
 Of all men,\
 The one who ordered fire to shine\
 On every activity\
 For gods and men alike.\
 Let us all in unison give the praise\
 To him who is high above the heavens,\
 The creator of all nature.\
 He is the Eye of the Intellect.\
 May he accept the praise of my powers.\
 Powers in me, praise the One and the All.\
 All you powers that are in me, sing in harmony with my will.\
 Holy knowledge,\
 Since I have been illumined by you,\
 While praising through you the intellectual light,\
 I rejoice with intellectual joy.\
 All powers, sing with me.\
 And you, self-control, sing with me.\
 My righteousness, praise the righteous through me.\
 My generosity, praise the All through me.\
 Truth, praise the Truth.\
 Good, praise the Good.\
 Life and Light, the praise goes from you to you.\
 I give thanks to you, Father, strength of the powers.\
 I give thanks to you, God, power of my forces.\
 Your Logos prasies you through me.\
 Through me accept the All in speech,\
 A spoken sacrifice.\
 The powers in me cry these things aloud;\
 They praise the All;\
 They accomplish your will.\
 Your wish goes from you to you, the All.\
 Accept from all a spoken sacrifice,\
 The All which is in us.\
 Life, save!\
 Light, illumine!
