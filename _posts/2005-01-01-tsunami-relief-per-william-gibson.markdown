From William Gibson's blog. My work is matchin contributions. If I make
my contribution to one of these and give, say, $50, that means my work
will give another $50 for a total of $100. Then the Canadian government
would match that with another $100. So, my $50 becomes $200. Good plan.
**TSUNAMI** **Friday, 31 December 2004 08:16:27** The Canadian
government, until January 11th, will match any donation to major relief
operations working from Canada. In other words, you double the size of
your donation if you send money this way, rather than by sending it
directly to an affected country or donating in your own country.
Donations to [Oxfam Canada](http://www.oxfam.ca), [the Canadian Red
Cross](http://www.redcross.ca), [World Vision
Canada](http://www.worldvision.ca), [UNICEF
Canada](http://www.unicef.ca), [Care Canada](http://www.care.ca),
[Doctors Without Borders](http://www.msf.ca), [World University Service
of Canada](http://www.wusc.ca) , [Salvation
Army](http://www.salvationarmy.ca), [Canadian Food for the Hungry
International](http://www.cfhi.ca), [Save the Children
Canada](http://www.savethecchildren.ca), and [SOS Children's
Villages](http://www.soschildrensvillages.ca) will all be doubled by the
Canadian government -- but only until January 11th. Best wishes to
everyone for the new year. [Read
