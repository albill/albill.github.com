From William Gibson's blog. My work is matchin contributions. If I make my contribution to one of these and give, say, $50, that means my work will give another $50 for a total of $100. Then the Canadian government would match that with another $100. So, my $50 becomes $200. Good plan.

The Canadian government, until January 11th, will match any donation to major relief operations working from Canada. 

In other words, you double the size of your donation if you send money this way, rather than by sending it directly to an affected country or donating in your own country.

Donations to <A href="http://www.oxfam.ca">Oxfam Canada</A>, <A href="http://www.redcross.ca">the Canadian Red Cross</A>, <A href="http://www.worldvision.ca">World Vision Canada</A>, <A href="http://www.unicef.ca">UNICEF Canada</A>, <A href="http://www.care.ca">Care Canada</A>, <A href="http://www.msf.ca">Doctors Without Borders</A>, <A href="http://www.wusc.ca">World University Service of Canada</A> , <A href="http://www.salvationarmy.ca">Salvation Army</A>, <A href="http://www.cfhi.ca">Canadian Food for the Hungry International</A>, <A href="http://www.savethecchildren.ca">Save the Children Canada</A>, and <A href="http://www.soschildrensvillages.ca">SOS Children's Villages</A> will all be doubled by the Canadian government -- but only until January 11th. 

Best wishes to everyone for the new year.
