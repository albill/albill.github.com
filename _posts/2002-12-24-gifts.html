R and I did the gift exchange before she left to visit her sister. I got her some nice stuff (she can write about it if she wishes). I, on the other hand, got a number of very nice things that I'd been wanting.

In no particular order:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1568821301/">Nameless Cults</a> - This is the Cthulhu-related fiction of Robert E. Howard, famous as the creator of Conan the Barbarian. He was a friend and correspondent of H.P. Lovecraft and wrote many Cthulhu mythos tales that were published in <em>Weird Tales</em>. This book gathers them all together. I've never read any of them!!</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0345449266/">Children of Cthulhu</a> - This is a new collection of Cthulhu stories by modern authors including China Mieville who wrote <em>Perdido Street Station</em>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060280921/">Abarat</a> - Clive Barker's new "children's" book written and illustrated by him.</li>
	<li>A Two Headed Stuffed Bunny - Woo hoo! A local artist and acquaintance of R's, Windi, makes creepy stuffed animals. I was put out when I didn't get a chance to win one in a recent raffle and R went and had Windi make me one. It's Flopsy and Mopsy in one! ;-)</li>
</ul>
I have a number of other things but that's enough.
