Today, R and I went out to San Francisco for the Long Now Foundation's
[Mechanicrawl](http://www.longnow.org/mechanicrawl/) event. I'm a
charter member of the [Long Now Foundation](http://www.longnow.org) so I
was given free tickets to the event. Basically, the event was an
opportunity to explore a bunch of mechanical items (mostly ships) near
Pier 45, visit the Long Now Museum, and head over to the
[Exploratorium](http://www.exploratorium.edu/). Since we had been to the
Exploratorium in the last year and the walk was already relatively
lengthy, we skipped that portion of it.

We did visit the [Musee Mecanique](http://www.museemecaniquesf.com/),
the ships at the Hyde Street Pier, the [SS Jeremiah
O'Brien](http://www.ssjeremiahobrien.org/), a functioning Liberty ship
used in World War II for D-Day, and the [USS
Pampanito](http://www.maritime.org/pamphome.htm), a World War II
submarine.

Out of these, I probably enjoyed the visit of the USS Pampanito the
most, even though it was somewhat claustrophobic. We got to wander
through the length of the ship and look around quite a bit. R and I
enjoyed the day out but were pretty wasted by the end of it, between the
sun, the climbing on ships, and the wandering over a couple of miles of
San Francisco. I have a [photo
set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157606130969646/) of
pictures up on Flickr for those that are curious to see them.
