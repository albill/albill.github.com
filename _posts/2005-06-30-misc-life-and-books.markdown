Today was a long day. It is review time at work. I and my peers spent eight  hours in a room with our test manager (our immediate boss) doing calibration of  data for the team for the period of the last year. We're doing another six hours  tomorrow. Woot!

Needless to say, one walks out of these meetings a bit fried. I came home to  R and we went out to Greek food. We finished things off by watching the final  DVD of the second season of Millennium. That's finally done.

I finished Cory Doctorow's <strong>Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town</strong>  last night (available for free <a href="http://www.craphound.com/someone/">here</a>).  I haven't decided what to make of it yet. It is some kind of fantastic realism  piece (if that's the term). His previous novels have been slashdot-esque Science  Fiction. This is slashdot-esque surreal, modern fantasy. After all, the main  character's father is a mountain and his mother is a washing machine... There is  the obligatory tech as well: building a mesh wifi network in Toronto.

I think I'm going to sit down and finish the <strong>  <a href="http://www.rifters.com/">Rifters</a></strong> trilogy by Peter Watts now  (insert Millennium joke here). I read <strong>Starfish</strong> when it first came out. I  started <strong><a href="http://www.rifters.com/maelstrom/maelstrom_master.htm">  Maelstrom</a></strong> but didn't get into it so I put it aside. Now that the whole  thing is out (even though the bastards at Tor Books split the third book into  two books against the author's will), I figure that I should read it. Reading  Watts' <a href="http://www.rifters.com/real/newscrawl.htm">pseudo-blog</a>, it  is apparant that he is a kindred soul in some basic function of his outlook on  the world. I like him.

Someone made a little fan graphic for the Rifter protagonists of his books,  who are shit on by the world in more ways than they know:

They get their revenge in the end, right or wrong, better or worse.

Watts writes with an anger of the injustice of the world that reminds me of  Jon Courtnay Grimwood's work. People with power paying lip service to the  greater good while raping the world (sometimes literally).

On a completely different note, you can download over an hour of Hunter S.  Thompson from 1977 <a href="http://greylodge.org/gpc/?p=108">here</a>.
