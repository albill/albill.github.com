Over on Youtube, there is now a [copy of the first ten
minutes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3cL1zAQry4) of an interview
with Peter Lamborn Wilson (aka "Hakim Bey"). Much of the interview is
concerned with his articulation (not creation, as he pointed out) of the
idea of the Temporary Autonomous Zone (TAZ) in his writings back in the
1980s. I've maintained a [site for Bey's
writings](http://www.hermetic.com/bey) since around 1996 and was the
original distributor of TAZ electronically through Usenet back around
1992 or 1993 so my interest in Wilson's work, at least as Hakim Bey, is
longstanding. Wilson hasn't published much in the current century and
seems to have mostly dropped away. Almost all of his work was published
in that period and the video actually seems to date from around 2000.
While he is a controversial figure at times, his work, especially on
"[Immediatism](http://www.hermetic.com/bey/radio_se.html)," was
inspirational to me during my undergraduate years in college and beyond
to this day. This is one of the first interviews of any real quality
with Wilson that I've seen so it seems worth sharing. I do wish that the
entirety of the interview was available online as the ten minutes of it
is tantalizing but brief. [Mindlift.tv](http://www.mindlift.tv/) seems
to be digitizing large archives of interviews with various fringe
cultural figures and making brief portions of them [available on
Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/mindlifttv) as a teaser. Perhaps people
will be inclined to order the full length videos from Mindlift of the
interviews with Wilson, Leary, the Shulgins, and many others.
