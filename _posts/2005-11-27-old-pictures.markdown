I found some old pictures today in some papers...

Me and Madeline when she was little...

Erynn, Unknown Dude, and Rubylou at the opening party for Edge of the Circle Books at its current location in 1993.

Erynn is a pagan that I've known since I was about 18. Rubylou is one of my oldest and best friends (we worked at Edge of the Circle together) and she's the "other tall, hot chick" that I dated before my wife. She's some kind of Gnostic Catholic these days.

As a side note, that may be the only picture of my own that I've ever taken of Rubylou.
