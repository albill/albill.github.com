I found some old pictures today in some papers...

<p align="center"><img src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/al-madeline.jpg" border="1" height="377" width="495" />
Me and Madeline when she was little...

<p align="center"><img src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/edge-opening.jpg" border="1" height="286" width="489" />
Erynn, Unknown Dude, and Rubylou at the opening party for Edge of the Circle Books at its current location in 1993.

Erynn is a pagan that I've known since I was about 18. Rubylou is one of my oldest and best friends (we worked at Edge of the Circle together) and she's the "other tall, hot chick" that I dated before my wife. She's some kind of Gnostic Catholic these days.

As a side note, that may be the only picture of my own that I've ever taken of Rubylou.
