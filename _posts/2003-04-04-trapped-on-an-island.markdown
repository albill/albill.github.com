Well, we're in Santorini now (in Thera). We have a room for fairly cheap
in the main part of town. We were planning on staying for two nights and
then going to Crete a day early to get an extra day there...but it turns
out that there is no boat to Crete on Friday or Saturday. We're here
until Sunday unless we go to another island for Saturday night that has
service to Crete (perhaps on the same boat). We wandered around the old
town today after we got here. Lots of narrow streets. R and I bought
some local guidebooks and I also bought a book on Acrotiri and the
religion of the early inhabitants of Thera. Later, we went and had food
at a nice place. I had gyros and pita and R had the local special of
lamb and beef plus this garlic dish with it. We had tzatiki as well. All
pretty good. We played a game of pool (badly), much to the amusement of
some locals and now we're at the local Internet cafe. It's around 8:00
pm local time and we'll go back to our rooms to relax in a little while.
