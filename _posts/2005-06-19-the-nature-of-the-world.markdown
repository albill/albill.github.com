David Noss is the author of the textbook for the World Religion graduate
class that I am taking for my Master's. He has a nice summary quote of
the nature of the world in the Buddha's teachings that I find
particularly apropos. I think it resonates relatively well with modern
thought.

> “Wherever we observe it, the living world, whether about us or within
> ourselves, is constantly in flux, in a state of endless becoming.
> There is no central, planning world self, no sovereign Person in the
> heavens holding all together in unity. There is only the ultimate
> unity of Being itself, whose peace enfolds the individual self when it
> ceases to call itself ‘I’ and enters the featureless purity of
> Nirvana."
