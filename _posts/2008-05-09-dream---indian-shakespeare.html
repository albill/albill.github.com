R had been fortunate enough to win tickets to this through BART, of all things. "Dream" is a version (retelling?) of Shakespeare's "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Midsummer_Night%27s_Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a> that stars an Indian and Sri Lankan cast in all of the roles. The setting and circumstances of the play are given an Indian viewpoint, including language in much of it. The show toured India and then England before coming to San Francisco. The show included a fairly minimalist set but made use of a certain amount of acrobatics in order to utilize the vertical space. The costumes, dancing, and singing were just beautiful. I feel very fortunate to have gotten to see this. The only difficulty for some will be the mix of languages. If you aren't familiar with the story, when the actors switch from one language to another (which happens quite often), you may become confused. You can see a <a href="http://www.dreamonstage.co.uk/dream.mov">large video</a> promoting the piece on its <a href="http://www.dreamonstage.co.uk">British website</a>. Watch the video for a good mix of little bits from the show. This was an incredible show and I recommend that those of you in the Bay Area take the time to go to it if you have the chance. You can read a <a href="http://www.theaterdogs.net/2008/05/08/review-a-midsummer-night%E2%80%99s-dream%E2%80%99/">review of the show</a> with pictures. SHN has also done a podcast episode about the show, which you can listen to <a href="http://shnsf.com/dynamic/widgets/link_1_3590.mp3">here</a>, which includes some audio from it, along with discussion.
