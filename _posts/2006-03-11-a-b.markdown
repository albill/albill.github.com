Oh, and I got my second 'B' of my entire graduate work (and the last one
was a 'B+'). My prof didn't like the way I didn't discuss the entire
Symposium in his six page paper (which I pushed to seven as it was)
along with Sophocles. Personally, I felt utterly constrained by the
space requirements or I would have done so.
