A little mini-geek tech update. A friend of mine on a local e-mail list suggested the following for file sharing: <blockquote>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <a href="http://www.slsknet.org/">http://www.slsknet.org/</a> >From their bulletin board: "This is simply a notice for those using the previous fixes of the Soulseek client to please update your client software. The previous Soulseek domain (slsk.org) has been rebought, and it is not the client, nor does it have anything to do with Soulseek whatsoever. The program offered from the site is Mainpean Stardialer. Those having problems with popups or adverts may be having problems due to this fact. Remember, when and if you give the site URL out, that it is http://www.slsknet.org, and no longer http://www.slsk.org. Cheers." For those people who are more interested in obscure electronic music as opposed to Metallica, Jay-Z, or Britney Spears, this is the p2p net for you. You'll easily find Luke Vibert's new album _Yoseph_, or the entire shitkatapult catalog for instance, but you'll be hard-pressed to find a complete Blink 182 album.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </blockquote> The Tungsten C I wrote about before finally arrived. I picked it up yesterday from Fedex. I already love it more than my Dell Axim. It's got a snappy 400mhz processor anf 64MB of RAM. This plus built-in WiFi and Thumb Keyboard. I configured it quickly to use my WEP enabled 802.11b network at home and tested it out. I then went out to Third Place Books locally where they have WiFi (seemingly provided by the county library) and was able to send and receive e-mail there. The main problems that I have are two-fold:

I've read a bunch of reviews that say the same thing. PalmSource does make a nice web browser but they chose not to ship it with their OS. Instead, they want me to pay $35 in order to purchase it. <strong>WTF</strong>? I just bought a device with your OS, why nickel and dime me to get a real web browser?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <li>

Versamail, the built-in e-mail program from PalmSource, supports IMAP. It <em>claims</em> that any e-mail folder with 16 characters or less in the title can be found, synchronized and used. Unfortunately, this is a lie. I have about 40 e-mail folders on my IMAP account, which are organized around e-mail lists that I am a member of and people that I exchange a lot of mail with. How many folders does Versamail say that I have available on my account? Eight. Hmmm... They are all under 16 characters in the name of the folder too. What gives? Perhaps I need to find another e-mail client to go with my new web browser? :-D

That's cool. I'd like a Java runtime but they seem to want me to pay for that as well... (I detect a trend.)

I wonder if this thing will be able to run Palm OS 6 whenever it comes out? I think <lj user="stonemirror"> said it probably would.</lj>
