I particularily like his rant about the Matrix and the purposeful
ripping off of material from **The Invisibles** for it.

> **DRE**: I read a lot about how The Invisibles was so personal and
> autobiographical for you. I haven't seen your plays but have you ever
> done straight autobiography? **GM**: Not really. Pop Mag!c is a book
> I'm doing right now which is kind of an account of all the occult
> stuff I've studied and the personal system of magic I've developed
> over the years so it has a lot of autobiography in it. Otherwise I
> tend to turn events in my life into the symbolic material that fills
> the stories. All the autobiographical stuff ends up in the work - if
> I'm feeling depressed, I'll call the depression something like
> Primordial Annihilator and send the Justice League in to kick its
> arse. The Invisibles was mostly stuff that was actually happening to
> me. I was up on a sacred mesa in New Mexico doing acid with a medicine
> man and all that. The dialogue for that whole sequence, in fact, was
> based on tape recordings I made of conversations I had with my friends
> on the mesa. A lot of stuff went straight into the book, such as going
> to Ladakh or Ulruru or San Francisco sex clubs.
