I found a copy of <b>Plato&apos;s Cosmology</b> by Francis Cornford this evening. This is an entire book published in 1935 on the <b>Timaeus</b> of Plato and understanding and decoding all of the symbology and cosmology within it. An essential text for your Neoplatonic magician!

I also retrieved my university library copy of <b>The Origins of Alchemy in Graeco-Roman Egypt</b>, which came heavily recommended to me and others by Nigel Jackson.
