The Flesch-Kincaid scale measures the readability of writing. This came up today because someone ran a section of Neil Gaiman's new novel that is available through this. Microsoft Word gives you the option of displaying readability after a spelling and grammar check. 

A piece of writing with a 75% readability will be understood by 75% of readers. Writing with a grade level of 8 will be understood by anyone with an 8th grade education or higher.

I just ran my first two graduate history papers and my first three graduate philosophy papers through this. I receive pretty consistant results for all of them with small ranges. For these classes, I'm not particularly trying to speak "up" in my writing. I'm writing in a fairly normal manner. The only thing that is different than my standard writing style is I simplify sentences during my editing process and move some to a more active voice. I tend to write more with a passive voice for some reason and I also tend to longer sentences with a number of subclauses and such. The results are from <b>after</b> my process on my final papers. (I've gotten 'A's on the first paper for each class and no grades yet for the next. I just finished my final edit of my third philosophy paper tonight.)

Here are my results:

Characters per word: <b>4.9</b>
Word per sentence: <b>18.6</b> (this went up to 21 on one paper)
Sentences per paragraph: <b>5.9</b>

Passive voice: <b>11%</b>
Reading Ease: <b>36.8%</b>
Flesh-Kincaid Grade Level: <b>12.0</b> (this varies down to 11.1 on two papers)

I'm not sure if this is good or bad but I may not have a future as a popular writer of fiction since I seem to bury the needle on grade level. I wonder if this affects my e-mails at work?

<b>Update:</b> I ran a bunch of my blog entries through it. The grade level moves down to 8.4 to 9.0 but the other statistics are pretty much the same.
