I caught sight of an [article in the New York
Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/business/yourmoney/26pre.html?_r=1&oref=slogin)
by my former boss, Dean Hachamovitch, on meeting culture and laptops. As
some of you may know, Dean is the General Manager of the Internet
Explorer team at Microsoft. I worked with him on both IE and MSN
Explorer before leaving Microsoft in May, 2006 for greener and more
fulfilling pastures. The article caused me to reflect on the difference
in meeting culture at Mozilla and Microsoft. In both instances, pretty
much everyone who has a laptop brings it to meetings. Of course, at
Microsoft, there were a **LOT** more meetings than Mozilla forces anyone
but key management to enjoy. I recall a number of instances on the IE
Team during the daily war meeting or the like in which people got so
exasperated with the lack of attention caused by people focusing on
their laptops that people really did try to close laptops on people or
make everyone in the room close. Eventually, there was a (short lived)
rule that unless you needed your laptop open to take the official notes
or to look up data for something of yours in the meeting agenda, the
laptops had to be closed. In comparison, most Mozilla meetings have
people lounging about with laptops wide open. People are often checking
bugs, logged into IRC (where we live, really) or otherwise multitasking
during meetings. It's all very casual and no one seems to make a major
issue out of it. Of course, that isn't an excuse to just goof off or not
pay attention but I think that people don't really expect everyone to
drop all other tasks to sit around a table for an hour, waiting for
their turn to speak. We have a lot to do and software to ship! The
overall atmosphere is just a bit more relaxed around the laptop issue
and, because people are neither rude in their use nor make a big deal
about it, things manage to work out. Of course, this might not be the
case if we spent hours and hours in meetings every day but, like I said,
we have things to get done and software to ship. :-) This is probably
not the most insightful post in the world but the article did cause me
to compare and contrast things. I certainly don't miss the hundreds of
my hours lost, never to return, every year to meetings either.
