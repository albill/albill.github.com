<p>After doing some sitting meditation downstairs last night, I was going 
through some of my ritual things that were in the same overall space. (When I 
started doing mostly sitting practice instead of theurgical workings, I moved 
the non-Buddhist items into the area with the couch and TV.) While looking at 
stuff, I noticed the ancient copy of Albert Pike&#39;s <b>Morals and Dogma</b> that 
I think I purchased when I was a teenager. I never made a study of it and I&#39;m 
not even sure why I bought it except for my vague interest in masonry. Now that 
I actually am a mason, it is probably a bit more interesting to me.</p>
<p>Pike&#39;s book was the one text on masonry that you seemed to find everywhere at 
one point (and probably still do). Technically, they aren&#39;t supposed to be 
distributed (mine has a paper glued inside the cover stating that it should be 
returned to the local Scottish Rite jurisdiction on the death of the owner) but 
people seem to have sold off many copies over the years. I think that it is such 
a hugely common book within the Scottish Rite over the last century that no one 
worries about it. I&#39;ve certainly seen open discussions of it on masonic lists. 
My copy was published and printed in 1946 and says that it was entered into the 
Library of Congress in 1871.</p>
<p>While pondering it and Pike&#39;s esoteric and cabalistic influences, which are 
quite apparent in the book, I began to wonder if maybe looking at this text, its 
history and those influences might be the MA topic related to fraternal orders 
and esotericism that I&#39;ve been looking for. I&#39;ll have to think about this a bit 
more, look through the text a bit, and see what scholastic work has been done on 
it.</p>
<p>Here is a sample drawn from the book and on the web at

<blockquote>
	<p>The Chaldean Oracles said: &quot;The intellect of the Generator, stirred to 
	action, out-spoke, forming within itself, by intellection universals of 
	every possible form and fashion, which issued out, flowing forth from the 
	One Source . . . For Deity, impersonated as Donlinion, before fabricating 
	the manifold Universe, posited an intellected and unchangeable universal, 
	the impression of the form whereof goes forth through the Universe; and that 
	Universe formed and fashioned accordingly, becomes visibly beautified in 
	infinitely varying types and forms, the Source and fountain whereof is 
	one.... Intellectual conceptions and forms from the Generative source, 
	succeeding each other, considered in relation to ever-progressing Time, and 
	intimately partaking of THE PRIMAL ETHER or FIRE; but yet all these 
	Universals and Primal Types and Ideas flowed forth from, and are part of, 
	the first Source of the Generative Power, perfect in itself.&quot;</p>
	<p>The Chaldeans termed the Supreme Deity ARAOR, Father of Light. From Him 
	was supposed to flow the light above the world, which illuminates the 
	heavenly regions. This Light or Fire was considered as the Symbol of the 
	Divine Essence, extending itself to inferior spiritual natures. Hence the 
	Chaldean oracles say: &quot;The Father took from Himself, and did not confine His 
	proper fire within His intellectual potency:&quot; . . &quot;All things are begotten 
	from one Fire.&quot;</p>
	<p>The Tsabeans held that all inferior spiritual beings were emanations from 
	the supreme Deity; and therefore Proclus says: &quot;The progression of the gods 
	is one and continuous, proceeding downward from the intelligible and latent 
	unities, and terminating in the last partition of the Divine cause.&quot;</p>
	<p>It is impossible to speak clearly of the Divinity. Whoever attempts to 
	express His attributes by the help of abstractions, confines himself to 
	negatives, and at once loses sight of his ideas, in wandering through a 
	wilderness of words. To heap Superlatives on Superlatives, and call Him 
	best, wisest, greatest, is but to exaggerate qualities which are found in 
	man. That there exists one only God, and that He is a Perfect and Beneficent 
	Being, Reason legitimately teaches us; but of the Divine Nature, of the 
	Substance of the Deity, of the manner of His Existence, or of the mode of 
	creation of His Universe, the human mind is inadequate to form any just 
	conception. We can affix no clear ideas to Omnipotence, Omniscience, 
	Infinity or Eternity; and we have no more right to attribute intelligence to 
	Him, than any other mental quality of ourselves, extended indefinitely; or 
	than we have to attribute our senses to Him, and our bodily organs, as the 
	Hebrew writings do.</p>
