I get a lot of work done on my site when I'm sitting around here... I
just added [Correspondence between Aleister Crowley and Frieda
Harris](http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/crowley-harris.html) (concerning
the Thoth Tarot). I'm adding a collection of Crowley's Simon Iff stories
as we speak as well. I've been meaning to put them up for a while
[here](http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/simon_iff/). Sooner or later I'm
going to add something that gets me a stern letter from someone. It gets
difficult when the order publishes stuff (online and off) and then tells
everyone, years later, that it can no longer be published. *De Arte
Magica* comes to mind here... Of course, I know of about a dozen places
where the old pamphlets of it are still for sale.
