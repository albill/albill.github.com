Apparently, Google is going to release a web browser based on Webkit
sometime in the near future. It is called "Chrome." While the browser is
not available yet, a web comic, drawn by Scott McCloud was accidentally
placed online early and then found by people (as an aside, I've seen
this kind of thing bite a lot of projects in the ass before).

You can see the entire comic at
[http://blogoscoped.com/google-chrome/](http://blogoscoped.com/google-chrome/)
(if the server has come back up). I've also made a version of it
available in a .cbz comic book file at
[http://www.mediafire.com/?sct1crovjdj](http://www.mediafire.com/?sct1crovjdj).
*[CBZ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Book_Archive_file) files are
simply zip files containing images for use in reading comic books on
computers. If you don't have a computer comic book reader program, you
can just unzip the file and look at the numbered images in order in the
file.* [This page](http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2008-09-01-n47.html)
details some of the promised features mentioned in the comic but you can
read it for yourself. [TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com) also has a
[post](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/01/no-joke-google-introduces-its-own-browser-with-a-cartoon/)
on this Google browser as well. Not having seen this browser yet (no one
outside Google has, I would guess), it is hard to give an opinion on it.
Generally, as long as things are standards based so we don't have to
write some specialized version of web pages for a browser, I'm in the
"the more, the merrier" camp, especially if it turns out to be entirely
open source. Since they are using WebKit as the rendering engine for it,
I expect that it will render pages as well (or as badly) as Safari does.
Once I actually get a chance to play with it, I expect that I will have
opinions about the specific Chrome features and whether they live up to
their promises. I am kind of surprised that they used a web comic to
explain the browser though. Most people would just write a simple web
page or something. I'm not sure if this is a cool idea or just kind of a
dumb one. Reactions will obviously vary. :-) **Update:** Just as I
posted this, the Google Blog put up a
[post](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/fresh-take-on-browser.html)
on their new browser. They are launching a Windows-only beta for it on
September 2 (tomorrow). The comic is now
[online](http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/) at Google.
