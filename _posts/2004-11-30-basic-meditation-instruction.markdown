That could be quite frightening or quite boring, but after a while, all that slips away. We get into some kind of natural rhythm and begin to discover our basic mind and heart.

As we practice, that is one of the basic beliefs we try to overcome. The point is that meditation is completely normal; it is the mindful quality present in everything we do.

Throughout our day everything pulls us away from natural mindfulness, from being on the spot. Our natural tendency to rush means that we're rushing past opportunities. We're either too scared or too embarrassed or too proud or just too crazy, to be who we are.

So practicing meditation begins by simplifying everything. We sit on the cushion, follow our breath and watch our thoughts. We simplify our whole situation.

Unless we are able to deal with our mind and body in a very simple way, it is impossible to think about doing high-level practices. How the Buddha himself, having done all kinds of practices, became the Buddha was simply to sit. He sat under a tree and he did not move. He practiced exactly as we are practicing.

We're trying to overcome all sorts of anxieties and agitation, all sorts of habitual thought patterns, so we are able to sit with ourselves. Life is difficult, we may have tremendous responsibilities, but the odd thing, the twisted logic, is that the way we relate to the basic flow of our life is to sit com-pletely still. It might seem more logical to speed up but here we are reducing everything to a very basic level.

Quite simply, mindfulness is complete attention to detail. We are completely absorbed in the fabric of life, the fabric of the moment. We realize that our life is made of these moments and that we cannot deal with more than one moment at a time. Even though we have memories of the past and ideas about the future, it is the present situation that we are experiencing.

We might feel that thinking about the past or the future makes our life richer, but by not paying attention to the immediate situation, we are actually missing our life. There's nothing we can do about the past, we can only go over it again and again, and the future is completely unknown.

When we talk about the techniques of meditation, we're talking about the techniques of life. We're not talking about something that is separate from us. When we're talking about being mindful and living in a mindful way, we're talking about the practice of spontaneity.

We are not saying that our immediate situation is unworthy. What we're saying is that the present situation is completely available and unbiased, and that we can see it that way through the practice of mindfulness.

First, it is important how we relate with the room and the cushion where we will practice. One would relate with where one is sitting as the centre of the world, the centre of the universe. It is where we are proclaiming our sanity, and when we sit down the cushion should be like a throne.

Our legs are crossed, shoulders relaxed. We have a sense of what is above, a sense that something is pulling us up at the same time that we have a sense of the ground. The arms should rest comfortably on the thighs. Those who cannot sit down on a cushion can sit in a chair. The main point is to be somewhat comfortable.

The basic feeling is one of comfort, dignity and confidence. If you feel you need to move you should just move, just change your posture a little bit. So that is how we relate with the body.

The basic technique is that we begin to notice our breath, that we could have a sense of our breath. The breath is what we're using as the basis of our mindfulness technique; it brings us back to the moment, back to the present situation. The breath is something that is constant-otherwise it's too late.

We don't accentuate or alter the breath at all, just notice it. So we notice our breath going out, and when we breathe in, there is just a momentary gap, a space. There are all kinds of meditation techniques and this is actually a more advanced one. We're learning how to focus on our breath while at the same time giving some kind of space to the technique.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Then we realize that, even though what we're doing is quite simple, we have a tremendous number of ideas, thoughts and concepts-about life and about the practice itself. And the way we deal with all these thoughts is simply by labeling them. We just note to ourselves that we're thinking, and return to following the breath.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        So if we wonder what we're going to do for the rest of our life, we simply label it thinking. If we wonder what we're going to have for lunch, simply label it thinking. Anything that comes up, we gently acknowledge it and let it go.

If you're thinking how wonderful meditation is, then that is still thinking. How great the Buddha was, that's still thinking. If you feel like killing the person next to you, just label it thinking. No matter what extreme you go to, it's just thinking, and come back to the breath.

Our life has created a barrage of different storms, elements and emotions that are trying to unseat us, trying to destabilize us. All sorts of things come up, but they are labeled thoughts and we are not drawn away. That is known as holding our seat, just dealing with ourselves.

We maintain our dignity and humour and the same lightness of touch we use dealing with our thoughts. Holding our seat doesn't mean we are stiff and trying to become like rocks; the whole idea is learning how to be flexible. The way that we deal with ourselves and our thoughts is the same way that we deal with the world.

But once we begin to have the quality of being tamed, when we can sit with ourselves, we realize there's a vast wealth of possibility that lies in front of us. Meditation is looking at our own backyard, you could say, looking at what we really have and discovering the richness that already exists. Discovering that richness is a moment-to-moment process, and as we continue to practice our awareness becomes sharper and sharper.

It is the best way to appreciate our world, to appreciate the sacredness of everything. We add mindfulness and all of a sudden, the whole situation becomes alive. This practice soaks into everything that we do; there's nothing left out. Mindfulness pervades sound and space. It is a complete experience.
