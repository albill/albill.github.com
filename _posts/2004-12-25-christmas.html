<p>Christmas Day and all of the joys associated with it!</p>
<p>R and I got up this morning, got ready and then headed straight over to my 
grandparents for Christmas morning, which I traditionally do with these fine, 
Christian, folk. My grandparents, my daughter and my ex-wife were all over 
there, the latter two having spent the night. Did I mention before that my 
ex-wife, Chris, is always around my grandparents&#39; place? They watch Madeline a 
lot of the time and Chris helps my grandmother out a bit so they&#39;ve got some 
sort of weird symbiotic thing going. Having my first wife and my current wife 
both there was different, to say the least.</p>
<p>This is the first time that R has gone there as she normally is in the Bay 
Area with her family but couldn&#39;t go this year. We did the normal gift exchange 
and then went and did the Christmas Brunch at the dining room of their 
retirement community. The food there is generally better than you&#39;d expect and 
we had a good time. Eventually, after the brunch and chatting for a while, we 
took our leave.</p>
<p>After a quick stop by the only open Starbucks in the area, we headed over to 
Rubylou&#39;s place for her casual Christmas rescue mission. Rubylou has an open 
house every Christmas afternoon and evening for any strays, lonely Jews, and 
people needing to recover from family gatherings. There was a pretty good spread 
of food there and I got to spend some time talking to Rubylou, her SO, Sean the 
Apple Guy, and playing with Lulu the Kitty and Livy the baby. Strange as this 
may seem to some people, little babies like me almost as much as cats do and I 
played with Livy on and off the whole time that I was there. She&#39;s a fun kid.</p>
<p>We just got home a short while ago and I&#39;m ready to unwind a bit. Today was 
the first day of rain all week and it turns out the my emergency seal on the 
roof does nothing so the drip was back this morning and afternoon. Luckily, the 
rain seems to have stopped so I can quit being annoyed by it for now. This had 
better be fixed on Tuesday though.</p>
<p>I think I&#39;ll go read my Grimwood novel now.</p>
