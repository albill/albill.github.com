Needless to say, I'm back in Seattle from San Diego. Trip Summary:

-   **Brother in Law's wedding** - Woo. Don't ever make me wear a suit
    again (with or without my paisley tie). Please. *I told Rebecca that
    she can bury me in it but I'm actually supposed to be cremated...*
-   **San Diego Zoo** - Monkeys!! See cute pictures below.
-   **Hunks-a-go-go** - Almost enough to make me turn gay. I think I've
    seen some of the buffest men that I've encountered in years (and
    fashionably dressed with much bling too). Mr. T jokes were made.
