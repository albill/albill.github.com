You can read the first 17 issues of the Pomegranate online now as a PDF file <a href="http://www.uscolo.edu/natrel/pom/backissues.html">here</a>. For those that don't know, this is one of the few journals of paganism that actually has attempted to become a peer-reviewed journal and publish academic articles on paganism by pagan scholars. I have many issues but never wound up subscribing. I'm very happy to find it online though.
