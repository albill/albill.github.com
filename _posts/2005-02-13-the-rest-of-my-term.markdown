These are the assignments that I'll be working on for my classes for the
rest of the quarter. I wrote them up so I could get them straight in my
head. After this first one, they are staggered until the end since the
Philosophy class requries slightly more, shorter, papers.

>
> ABOUT THE WILSON AND TOSH BOOKS
>
> These books are included to illustrate trends in historical thinking
> and approach that emerged after the Gustavson book was written, to
> provide some alternative approaches to Gustavson, and to give the
> student some tools to critique Gustavson. It also introduces you to
> some of the dialogue that is carried on among professional historians.
> The advances in historiography since Gustavson do not "relegate
> Gustavson to history", however. His analytical approach and the
> valuable tools he gives the student are and will remain very useful
> for the study of history. All methods are used by historians, even
> those from the ancient Greek "father of History", Herodotus (484-420
> BC), whose books are still in print!
>
> In addition to the assigned pages in theses books, you might be
> interested in tackling the way postmodernism has entered the field of
> history, or examining briefly the history of historical writing.

>     paragraph), and a brief summary of his/her main contentions or
>     conclusions. Try to insure that the author of the book you'll use
>     is a historian. (This should be part of the author's background,
>     that you research). Note: Do not simply write what is on the book
>     jacket! Gain this information from standard reference sources.
> 2.  Next, discuss how your author deals with causes (short term, long
>     term, multiple), using a concrete example or examples.
> 3.  Depending upon the contents of your book, explain and comment upon
>     how TWO of Gustavson's following categories are presented: social
>     forces; change and continuity; ideas; individuals; institututions
>     (define the category before you begin; if social forces, explain
>     what these are, etc.).
> 4.  Show how or if your chosen book utilizes recent trends in
>     historiography, using the assigned topics in Wilson and Tosh. If
>     recent trends are not included, show how they could or should be.

>     History Book" in this course guide).
> 6.  Include a photocopy of the table of contents of your chosen book -
>     this is essential!
