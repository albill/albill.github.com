So, on the school front, the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/religion/">Comparative Religion</a> program at the University of Washington is looking decent. I still need someone with more than half a clue to give me their impression of it. It turns out one of my fellow Greek students has a BA from it that she received only two years ago. She had a lot of good things to say about the program. Of course, I'd technically wind up with a Masters in International Studies (Comparative Religion) if I got a degree there. I'm assuming that this won't be a barrier to going somewhere for a PhD but that will have to be checked. The other issue is that I can have a minor concentration in Greco-Roman religion but not a major concentration. The available major concentrations are:
<ul>
	<li>Religion and Culture</li>
	<li>Judaism</li>
	<li>Hinduism</li>
	<li>Christianity</li>
	<li>Islam</li>
	<li>Buddhism</li>
	<li>Hebrew Bible/Ancient Near East</li>
</ul>
So, depending on how rigid they are, I could either take a major concentration in Religion and Culture and try to do my own thing or perhaps do a major concentration in Buddhism. The problem with the latter is that you need three years in your primary language and if I did the Buddhism thing, that's either Sanskrit or Tibetan (this is leaving aside the fact that even through the UW says they teach Tibetan, they don't seem to ever offer it...). Greek would have to be dropped and probably soon...

Part of the problem here is how to present my interests to the school if I want to get accepted. My interests academically mirror my interests in life: Late Antiquity's magic, philosophy, and religion (what's the difference?), magical (tantric) Buddhism, ritual and magic in general, especially its intersection with culture, religion and individuals. That's not exactly a very narrow set of areas and while they overlap <strong>to me</strong>, I don't know if some admissions or graduation committee would agree.

I haven't discovered a single narrower problem or focus for a particular MA that would work well. If I was fluent in Tibetan, I could try to look at the intersection of tantra in religion or magic. In a lot of ways, I'd be better off looking at that in a modern context or in the Greco-Roman world though. I don't have a lot of ideas queued up here and I need some before I can apply.

There is also the issue that I have no references after being out of school for about a decade nor do I have any "writing samples" that are anywhere near current.
