So, on the school front, the [Comparative
Religion](http://depts.washington.edu/religion/) program at the
University of Washington is looking decent. I still need someone with
more than half a clue to give me their impression of it. It turns out
one of my fellow Greek students has a BA from it that she received only
two years ago. She had a lot of good things to say about the program. Of
course, I'd technically wind up with a Masters in International Studies
(Comparative Religion) if I got a degree there. I'm assuming that this
won't be a barrier to going somewhere for a PhD but that will have to be
checked. The other issue is that I can have a minor concentration in
Greco-Roman religion but not a major concentration. The available major
concentrations are:

-   Religion and Culture
-   Judaism
-   Hinduism
-   Christianity
-   Islam
-   Buddhism
-   Hebrew Bible/Ancient Near East

So, depending on how rigid they are, I could either take a major
concentration in Religion and Culture and try to do my own thing or
perhaps do a major concentration in Buddhism. The problem with the
latter is that you need three years in your primary language and if I
did the Buddhism thing, that's either Sanskrit or Tibetan (this is
leaving aside the fact that even through the UW says they teach Tibetan,
they don't seem to ever offer it...). Greek would have to be dropped and
probably soon... Part of the problem here is how to present my interests
to the school if I want to get accepted. My interests academically
mirror my interests in life: Late Antiquity's magic, philosophy, and
religion (what's the difference?), magical (tantric) Buddhism, ritual
and magic in general, especially its intersection with culture, religion
and individuals. That's not exactly a very narrow set of areas and while
they overlap **to me**, I don't know if some admissions or graduation
committee would agree. I haven't discovered a single narrower problem or
focus for a particular MA that would work well. If I was fluent in
Tibetan, I could try to look at the intersection of tantra in religion
or magic. In a lot of ways, I'd be better off looking at that in a
modern context or in the Greco-Roman world though. I don't have a lot of
ideas queued up here and I need some before I can apply. There is also
the issue that I have no references after being out of school for about
a decade nor do I have any "writing samples" that are anywhere near
current.
