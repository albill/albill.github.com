I missed the links to the blogging dinner that I attended in March when they went up. A bunch of us involved in blogging at Microsoft went out to dinner, which was organized by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/betsya/">Betsy Aoki</a>. We got to chat about blogging within the borg a bit and had a good time.

Here is a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/korbyp/archive/2006/03/05/544111.aspx">link</a> to a blog post with a photo of us....

Now that I'm leaving the company, Betsy is taking over the 950+ person internal e-mail list I run at Microsoft on blogging. Good luck!!
