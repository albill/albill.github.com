<p>R and I just got back from Ashley&#39;s &quot;White Trash&quot; birthday party. The whole 
party was themed along white trash lines. Many wife beaters, house coats, gimme 
caps and other bad clothes were there in spades. The musical soundtrack for the 
event seemed to be mostly 80s hair bands with the occasional throwback to early 
Black Sabbath, Dio, or Van Halen from the 70s. </p>
<p>The food, of course, was questionable. Velveeta cheese dip, Chili Mac n&#39; 
Cheese, mustard sardines, jello with stuff in it, some kind of Frito chip 
pie..and lots of PBR!</p>
<p>It was a fun event and some people went all out with their Value Village 
wardrobe.</p>
