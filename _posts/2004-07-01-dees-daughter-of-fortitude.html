<p>Received by Sir Edward Kelley with Dr. John Dee in 1595 as a communication from the spirits.</p>
<p>Transcribed from Cotton Appendix XLVI, Division XII, &quot;Actio Tertio Trebonae 
Generalis&quot;, ff. 218-220</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>I am the daughter of fortitude, &amp; ravished every hour, from<br>
	my youth, for behold, I am understanding, &amp;<br>
	science dwelleth in me : &amp; the heavens oppress me,<br>
	They covet and desire me with infinite appetite<br>
	few or none that are earthly have embraced me<br>
	for I am shadowed with the circle of the sun : and covered with<br>
	the morning clouds: My feet are swifter than the winds,<br>
	&amp; my hands are sweeter than the morning dew. My garments<br>
	are from the beginning: &amp; my dwelling place is in my<br>
	self. The lion knoweth not where I walk : neither<br>
	do the beasts of the field understand me. I am deflowered &amp;<br>
	yet a virgin. I sanctify &amp; am not sanctified<br>
	happy is he that embraceth me. for in the night season<br>
	I am sweet, in the day full of pleasure</p>
	<p>my company is a harmony of many cymbals<br>
	And my lips sweeter than health itself. I am a harlot<br>
	for such as ravish me : and a virgin with such as know<br>
	me not : for lo I am loved of many : &amp; I am a<br>
	lover to many: and as many as come unto me as they should<br>
	do, have their entertainment. Purge your streets o<br>
	you sons of men, &amp; wash your houses clean<br>
	Make your selves holy, &amp; put on righteousness<br>
	Cast out your old strumpets, &amp; burn their clothes<br>
	Abstain from the company of other women that are<br>
	defiled, that are sluttish, &amp; not so handsome, &amp;<br>
	beautiful as I. And then will I come &amp; dwell<br>
	amongst you. And behold I will bring forth<br>
	Children unto you: &amp; they shall be the sons of comfort<br>
	I will open my garments, &amp; stand naked before you<br>
	that your love may be more enflamed toward me.</p>
	<p>As yet, I walk in the clouds, As yet, I am carried with<br>
	the winds : And can not descend unto you for the multitude<br>
	of your abominations, &amp; the filthy loathsomeness of your dwelling<br>
	places. Behold these fowre, who is he, that<br>
	shall say, they have sinned : or unto whom shall<br>
	they make account? Not unto you, you sons<br>
	of men, nor unto your children : for unto the lord<br>
	belongeth the Judgment of his servants</p>
	<p>Now therefore, let the earth give forth her fruits unto<br>
	you : And let the mountains forsake their barrenness<br>
	where your footsteps shall remain. happy is he that<br>
	saluteth you : &amp; cursed is he that holdeth up his<br>
	hands against you. &amp; power shall be given unto<br>
	you from hence forth to resist your enemies : &amp; the<br>
	lord shall always here you in the times of your<br>
	troubles. And I am sent unto you to play<br>
	the harlot with you : And am to enrich you with the<br>
	spoils of other men : prepare for me, for I come<br>
	shortly. Provide your Chambers for me that they<br>
	may be sweet &amp; cleanly : for I will make a<br>
	dwelling place amongst you : and I will be<br>
	common with the father &amp; the son, yea and with<br>
	all them that truly favoreth you</p>
	<p>for my youth, is in her flower and my strength is not<br>
	to be extinguished with man. Strong am I above &amp;<br>
	below. Therefore, provide for me. for behold I now<br>
	salute you. And let peace be amongst you : for I<br>
	am the Daughter of Comfort. Disclose not<br>
	my secrets unto women : nether let them understand<br>
	how sweet I am. for all things belongeth not unto<br>
	every one</p>
	<p>I come unto you again.</p>
