After reviewing a number of the completed theses for my program, I find
that I am being a bit overly ambitious. I'm also finding that in my
review of Golden Dawn materials. I need to do something a bit more
straightforward. I have the current term to nail down my thesis, submit
the abstract and longer outlines of it, lay out my methods and
assumptions, and to give my (near) final bibliography. Right now, I'm
thinking along the following lines (and these are very loose thoughts
right now):

-   The Nature, Role, and Structure of the Soul in the Hermetic Order of
    the Golden Dawn.
-   The Theology of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (as described
    in rituals and papers).
-   Fall and Redemption in the Ritual Work of the Hermetic Order of the
    Golden Dawn.

The first of these is probably more promising as it would cover the
Qabalistic soul as understood within the GD (including innovations), its
connections to Neoplatonism (lightly), the Sphere of Sensation and the
Tree of Life, and how the soul is addressed in ritual. That seems to be
a workable 80 page thesis. The last of the ones above would cover much
of the same textual material but look at the use of the symbolism of the
Fall and Redemption within the Golden Dawn. Decisions, decisions.
