R and I took a drive out to the Muir Woods today. I had never been out
there before. Being from the Pacific Northwest, I am a great lover of
trees so going to the forest is a nice change from the last couple of
months of day to day in Oakland. I've put a photoset of pictures I took
there up on

After that, we took a visit to Chinatown in San Francisco. I had also
never been there except driving through by accident. We had a late lunch
at one of the restaurants and took a walk up and down Grant, looking at
shops along the way. I bought a couple of silk cloths to use on my
altar, a statue stand for one of my altar statues, and a couple of DVDs,
including the recent movie about poachers in Tibet.
