I got the day off as a "comp day" for some of the recent patch work on Internet Explorer. I slept in a bit and then Sarastro came over to do some ritual work relating to the Astrum Sophia and our degree work within it. We did a bit of work, which was quite good, and then hung out for a while discussing various things.

He and I have both been doing work with the platonic solids over the last year or so off and on as can be seen in the archon rituals that I wrote that are over at <a href="http://www.ogdoadic.com/rituals/index.html">http://www.ogdoadic.com/rituals/</a>. Sarastro's been working with them in the same context and trying to expand on them ritually as symbols of the elements. For our work, we've taken large dice, sanded and sealed them, and then painted them in the appropriate colors to make the solids. This works but it is less than ideal. He discovered yesterday, while researching polyhedra for the Eight Winds, that someone has die-cast solids available. I looked last year but couldn't find anything. We just ordered several sets (one for each of us and one for the Citadel) for our work. They are available at <a href="http://www.peda.com/models/">http://www.peda.com/models/</a> and seem quite nice.
