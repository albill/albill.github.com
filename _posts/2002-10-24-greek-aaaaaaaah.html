Alright, I just spent two hours copying vocabulary to little index cards, copying the A and O declensions for nouns and then doing assigned homework for Ancient Greek and this is <em>after</em> I get home from work!!!

The Greek declensions don't seem hard, just something that takes use to memorize. Of course, we don't do drills in class and I'm being tested on some basic vocabulary and O Declensions tomorrow in class. I wish we took more time to drill things. It's hard to know how my class compares to your average Greek class at the University.

Our teacher corrects our quizes but we simply write our homework on the whiteboard and go over it. I guess he likes not having to correct papers at home. ;-)
