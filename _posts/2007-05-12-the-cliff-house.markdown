R and I went out to Ocean Beach a week ago. It was her birthday and she
wanted to have brunch at the Cliff House. The Cliff House is a historic
landmark which has several restaurants in it. Originally, it was a
resort hotel for the rich and later the home to a popular set of public
baths. These were the "Sutro Baths", which later burned down from what I
can tell. There was an amusement park there at well, sort of a San
Francisco Coney Island. I took a number of pictures and [uploaded
them](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157600208849372/) to my
[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/) account. A few are below.
