I bet this thing is going to kick up some dust on the playa at Burning Man.

It is the "Neverwas Haul." A group of crazing built this faux-Victorian mobile steam house in a piece of retrocraziness. I definitely want to get a good look at this thing when I'm on the playa next week.

I missed out on a fund raiser for it last night.

They have a community on tribe.net at <a href="http://tribes.tribe.net/neverwas">http://tribes.tribe.net/neverwas</a>.
