It is of a tengu riding a fox. I find it interesting that it is carrying
the traditional implements of Fudo Myoo, the patron of the Mikkyo sects.
These are the coil of rope in the left hand and the sword in the right.
Wikipedia has this to say about tengu:

> **Tengu** are a class of supernatural creatures found in Japanese
> folklore, art, theater, and literature. They are one of the best known
> *[yōkai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yōkai "Yōkai")*
> (monster-spirits) and are sometimes worshipped as Shinto
> *[kami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kami "Kami")* (revered spirits or
> gods). Although they take their name from a dog-like Chinese demon,
> the *tengu* were originally thought to take the forms of birds of
> prey, and they are traditionally depicted with both human and avian
> characteristics. The earliest *tengu* were pictured with beaks, but
> this feature has often been humanized as an unnaturally long nose,
> which today is practically the *tengu's* defining characteristic in

Read the [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengu) if you are
interested. It's actually pretty good. Of course, Fox spirits
([*kitsune*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsune)) are also very well
known in Japanese as powerful beings and often tricksters as well. The
inscription on the back of the piece reads "The central Akiba worship,
Sanjyakubou Daigongen, Enshu (feudal name of Shizuoka Prefecture of
Japan), Kasuisai (temple)" in Japanese (according to its seller since my
Japanese doesn't exist...). This picture is one of my favorites from
Japan of a Tengu:
