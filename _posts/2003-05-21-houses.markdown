So, I attended my Latin class tonight. We're working on the joy of the relative pronoun (who, that, which, etc.). Oh, I can hardly contain my joy at deconstructing sentences that contain subordinate clauses.

That being said, the class is going fairly well. I've just been taking either Greek or Latin since the beginning of October and it wears a bit doing that two nights a week plus homework and studying along with having a day job, being part of two orders (one magical, one fraternal) and having a life.

On a plus note, R and I are going to go look at one of the houses we looked at last weekend tomorrow. We're pretty close to making an offer on it (assuming it passes a couple of different inspections and all of our financing goes through).

It is a split-level built in 1961 in the Kenmore area at the Northeast end of Lake Washington. It has five bedrooms, two bathrooms and a family room (soon to be ritual space...) on two floors. It also has a small utility room and a laundry room. It is on a quarter acre lot with a small pool in the back yard next to a deck.

The only downside is that the topsoil is about six inches thick above a layer of clay in this area so drainage in the back yard isn't the best. We're having the drainage system that the owner put in inspected for this reason. That's the only real wrinkle though.

It is also about three blocks from St. Edward's Park, which is a former seminary and the home of Bastyr college. Lots of space for wandering around and trails.

In many ways, I'd prefer an older style house but that seems unlikely to happen, especially in our price range and in the places we want to live. Unlike our current place which is over a nasty bridge and down two freeways from work (a 30-40 minute commute in mornings and 40-60 minute commute at night), this place is 20 to 30 minutes by non-freeway roads from work. It is also about a mile or so from the Burke-Gilman trail, which is a paved bike road that goes all the way around the north end of Lake Washington and actually has a branch that goes near my work. This means, if I really want to get into shape, that I could ride a bike about 11 or 12 miles to work on a bike-only road every day (except a mile at either end). That might turn out to be nice.

We'll see how it goes.
