I get really friggin' tee'd off when I spend significant amounts of personal time working on projects, often for other people, and then getting crap for them instead of a "Thank you" from parties that should appreciate it. What's the fucking deal?

"Gee, I did this nice thing that I was told you would probably like since you told a mutual friend that you needed someone to do it."

"No and don't ever do it again!"

Yeah, fuck you very much too.
