I'm going to read <strong>Notes from the Underground</strong> today if I have time. I'd like to get a draft of my next paper done <strong>before</strong> I leave for Thailand if at all possible. Keeping up with school and work from this trip will be a little bit of a bear but I'm looking forward to the trip anyway. Two weeks in Thailand!

I don't have the time during the next few months but it is nice that he thinks that I could do it and present. Perhaps later on, next year, I will put something together. I do have, as an overall goal, the desire to write a few papers for publication, regardless of whether I wind up going on to a PhD or any additional academic work in the future.
