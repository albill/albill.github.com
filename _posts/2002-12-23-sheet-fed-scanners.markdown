Anyone know where one can get access to a sheet fed scanner? I have about 200 pages of text on 8 1/2" X 11" sheets that I want to scan. I can do them one by one on mine but... We have the super advanced Xerox machines at work which are supposed to be able to this and save the images as Tiff files or PDF files but I can't seem to make it work. I suspect that they are disabled in those machines. It would go a hell of a lot faster if I could do this though.
