Oops, looks like I <a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2006/04/microsoft-fy06q3-results.html#c114631560962450571">made someone cranky</a>...

I could respond to this in some detail but it isn't worth the effort. Let's just say that <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/">Dare</a> has worked closely with the IE team on our RSS features. He was consulted, at least for his opinion, on much of the work. In spit of this, he makes a consistent public effort <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/CommentView.aspx?guid=c8048592-96bc-4362-beb8-4331daa7f7a8">to talk shit about IE7</a> and its RSS support while the people that I have worked with, who care passionately about RSS and its role in IE, keep on talking to him internally since Dare works on a partner team affected by the work.

I find Dare to be a whiner and an unconstructive partner who burns bridges with people that he should be building them with instead. The fact that he gives little direct feedback (or confrontation) to coworkers on the IE team but will then turn around, the same day, and make snarky comments in his blog is not cool. In fact, I'll be slightly bold and say it makes him look like a complete asshole.

Since I no longer have to work professionally with him in any capacity and this is my personal opinion, I don't see a reason to pull any punches. With his attitude, he really should go get a job for the competition. He certainly doesn't help the company he works for...

I have issues with how Microsoft has done many things but I have the utmost respect for the people that I have worked with, especially on the IE team. There are a lot of very intelligent and talented people there and I am glad that I had the opportunity to work with them.

For myself, it is time for a change. Part of it is motivatated by the desire that my wife and I have to live in the Bay Area and part of it is that I've worked at Microsoft for a month shy of nine years. It isn't the same company that I started at but I don't doubt it will survive. I'm at peace with that. I'm not so sure that Dare can say the same and, as was commented to me, it seems more likely that Dare is crafting his exit strategy and trying to make a name for himself. He's no <a href="http://scoble.weblogs.com/">Scoble</a> though so this seems a doomed adventure.
