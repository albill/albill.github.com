As most people reading this blog know, I'm a bit of a geek. One of the things that I'm terribly geeky about, historically, is Star Wars.

A few months ago, I decided to splurge before the holidays and I buy a machine milled light saber. (Yes, pretty dorky but fun!)

[Saber Forge](http://saberforge.com) had gotten really good reviews for making custom light sabers for people. You can [see examples](http://saberforge.com/index.php?page=view_album&image=138) of their work. 

It is very nice and I figured it would be fun to have. I hang out with a lot of geeks, from the hackerspace to my RPG group. Why not? I could afford it as a special item.

So I paid Saber Forge in early November and then...nothing. I contact them in December, to find out if I might get it by the holidays and was told that there was a backlog, sorry, but it would be sent out in the next couple of weeks. Ok, cool. I understand how it goes.

Then...nothing. I write Saber Forge in January and got no reply. February, no reply. Now March, no reply. At this point, since it actually turns out that Saber Forge is in Martinez, all of 30 minutes away, I'm filing in small claims court locally, where Phillip Isherwood, who owns it, will be compelled to attend or have a judgement against him. I actually wrote to him, more than once now, to warn him of this and to say, "Just return my money and it is all good." (No response, of course.) It is a bit sad that they can't actually communicate with people who have paid them. I'm reasonable enough that I'd work something out but now, after four months, I just feel like I've been ripped off. These things don't cost $50. When you charge people a couple of hundred bucks for something, they do expect some level of communication if there are delays and, maybe, eventually, the item they ordered.

I'm posting this as a public, Googleable, warning to others to not purchase anything from Saber Forge aka Phillip Isherwood of 312 Donegal Way, Martinez, CA. 94553 (510-410-5804) unless you just want to be ripped off. Phillip will just take your money and do nothing.
