I was going to write a nice post about the three day retreat from which
I just returned with my sangha. Instead, I'm writing, once again, about
current Zen scandals. It is the gift that keeps on giving. My mother
sent me of this today, "[Changes at Kanzeon Zen
Center](http://www.kanzeonzencenter.org/changes/)." She lives in Salt
Lake City and, while not a Buddhist, has connections in the community
and an interest in what is going on there. This post opens with the
following:

> "As previously announced, Genpo Roshi has retired as a Buddhist Priest
> but will continue as a Zen Master to teach and lead retreats, at the
> Bear Trap Lodge when in Salt Lake City and elsewhere including Hawaii.
> He has invited Rich Taido Christofferson Sensei to step in to take his
> place as full-time teacher at the Zen Center."

Now, as people may recall, at the beginning of April, Genpo Merzel (aka
Genpo Roshi), [officially
disrobed](http://sweepingzen.com/2011/02/07/dennis-genpo-merzel-disrobes-as-a-zen-priest/)
as a Zen priest and stepped down as an elder in the White Plum Asanga.
(I'd link to the posts where he announced it at
[http://www.bigmind.org/Home.html](http://www.bigmind.org/Home.html) and
[http://www.bigmind.org/Responsibility.html](http://www.bigmind.org/Responsibility.html)
but they are now a 404 link and have been removed.) When Genpo stepped
down, disrobed as a priest, and left his elder position in the White
Plum organization, I, like most, figured that meant, well, that he'd
disrobed as a Zen priest and wasn't acting as such any longer. That
word, "disrobed," generally means that sort of thing to those of us who
are Zen practitioners (as well as priests or monks). Apparently, we have
a princess bride situation here where Genpo uses that word differently.

There is no way that you can seriously say that you've disrobed and then
say that you are going to "continue as a Zen Master to teach and lead
retreats." I mean, seriously, what the hell? That makes his whole "I'll
own up to my mistakes, step down, and disrobe as a priest and elder"
into a punch line in a bad joke. The post on the Kanzeon site also goes
on to say (if the preceding wasn't clear enough):

He's still Kanzeon's abbot and will be teaching at "Solitude" (some kind
of retreat location) in the Cottonwood Canyon, which is just outside of
Salt Lake. I guess it was all some sort of farce or a public relations
bait and switch? You cannot "disrobe" and still be an abbot running a
center, running retreats, teaching students, and functioning as a Zen
priest. Where is your integrity, Genpo? Actually, where is the integrity
of Kanzeon's board and Rich Taido Christofferson, the supposed new
"abbot," to even allow this and act, with a straight face, as if it is
all good? Any belief that people had that Genpo had shown at least some
integrity in stepping down and acknowledging mistakes should be
reexamined very closely. People are being sold a pack of lies and I'd
recommend people stay far away from Kanzeon and its "abbot." **Update:**
A friend sent me Genpo's original statement that was on the Big Mind
home page. Compare it to what is revealed above (or on the Kanzeon site
where I link). I guess he chose his words **very** carefully since he
didn't actually say that he wouldn't be abbot, running Kanzeon, or
teaching as a Zen priest. Just that he had "chosen to disrobe" and "will
stop giving Buddhist Precepts or Ordinations." You wouldn't think you'd
quit being a priest but still maintain an attachment to the Zen Master
thing. Tricky, this Genpo!
