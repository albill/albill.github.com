<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/753056040/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1117/753056040_187111bf6e_m.jpg" alt="Al &amp; R on the Double Shot" align="right" height="179" width="240" /></a>R suggested on Friday that we go have a "fun day" out this weekend. We decided to go to Santa Cruz's boardwalk, which we had gone to a few years ago, before we moved here.

We drove down, got a pair of unlimited ride passes, and spent a few hours wandering around with the rides and eating bad food, like corndogs.

All in all, it was a good way to spend the afternoon. I put a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157600708400286/">photo set</a> of pictures up on Flickr but there is one notable picture from the Double Shot ride. The Double Shot is one of those rides where they launch you 100+ feet straight up into the air in seats and then you fall straight down. Needless to say, we did not eat first...
