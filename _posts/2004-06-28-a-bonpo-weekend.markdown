"Busy, busy, busy" was the mantra for the last few days.

I took Friday off from work so I could go to Portland. I spent the morning  getting my oil changed and having lunch with R and then headed down. I arrived  at Ariche's house around 4:30 and hung out with her and her wonderful pup,  Artemis aka Miss Pig. The only dog that I'll ever truly love...

<img width="220" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="185" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/ponloprinpoche-2.jpg" />The  purpose of this trip was to see Menri Ponlob Rinpoche, a  <a href="http://www.tibetanbon.com/">Bonpo</a> lama who is the Principle  Instructor of the Bon Dialectic School at  <a href="http://www.tibetanbon.com/monastery.htm">Menri Monastery</a> in Tibet,  the main Bonpo monastery. He also has a geshe degree, the Tibetan equivalent of  a PhD.

For those that don't know, Bon is considered the indigenous religion of Tibet  (though we could get into a discussion of "Old" versus "New" Bon and such). In  practice, it is fairly similar to the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism (or  vice versa). <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/vt/vajranatha/bondzog.html">Both  Bon and Nyingma traditions are the primary groups maintaining and teaching  Dzogchen over the last thousand years</a>.

Ponlop Rinpoche comes to the Portland area about once a year and is working  towards establishing the <a href="http://dzogchenydl.org/index.html">Dzogchen  Yungdrung Ling</a> center there but that is years away at this point. The  organizers there organize a world-wide teaching trip for him annually and  Portland is the only place where he teachings on Dzogchen.

I attended a Friday night introductory lecture by him at a local Zen center.  Saturday was a 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM introduction to and transmission of a  particular Bon Dzogchen text and a lot of general teaching on Dzogchen. Sunday  morning was more of the same. Notable compared to some teachings I've attended  was that Rinpoche stopped fairly often for Q&A and was willing to spend up to a  half hour on an interesting question or two before moving on. I actually got to  ask him a question about the achievement of the "Rainbow Body" in modern times  based on some comments he made about it not being reliably seen since 1935. As  the teacher of the Bon Dialectic School, it turns out that he's fairy stringent  when it comes to standards for reports of such things and he explained the  process that they went through in investigating claims when they came up a  little.

As with almost every Tibetan teacher that I've ever met, he was jovial, warm,  and extremely friendly. He radiated a calm happiness about life (unlike many  Buddhists of Western ethnicity for some reason). In an amusing aside, I noticed  that he consulted his watch often, started promptly on time, offered unsolicited  and regular breaks every hour or two, and ended on time. Anyone who has worked  with Tibetan teachers much will understand the novelty of a teacher that  functions within Western norms on time and who doesn't need to be asked to give  a break to pee and stretch. He's also the first lama that preferred lattes over  tea. We did a coffee run for him (and the rest of us) at one point, which gave  us a longer break. A lama after my heart.

Since I got home, I've e-mailed the organizers of the event as I really do  want to keep a connection going with Ponlop Rinpoche. He struck me as the "real  deal" and very down to earth on many levels. He showed a lot of simple wisdom  about how people are but also wasn't afraid to speak about things. He made a  couple of simple descriptions of Thogdal, for example. He didn't teach on it but  he was actually willing to discuss it a little, which is something that I  haven't run into before.

How his lineage of Dzogchen practice relates to that of Namkhai Norbu on a  personal level is interesting. Time will tell how that interaction works. I  consider Namkhai Norbu my primary teacher but I'm also making connections with  other Dzogchen teachers where I can when they seem reputable and solid. Ponlop  Rinpoche is defnitely more orthodoz than Norbu in what he teaches in some ways  but I think that is just surface stuff.

Otherwise, I hung out with Ariche and Gleibinger a bit at their house. Ariche  had circulated the word to the OTO brethren that I was in town and called for a  little party at their place Saturday night. A bunch of people came over (12 or  so?) and I won't list them all. We drank a bit of wine, had a little food, BS'd  a bit about politics, online idiots and had an interesting conversation about  the...ins and outs...of various sex toys and the weird people that use some of  them. You had to be there, I guess. It turned out that one of the party guests  used to work in a Sex Shop and she had some interesting comments and stories to  tell as well. Neither here nor there though.

Driving around Portland as a city just feels like home much of the time. I'm  convinced that I could live there and that I might even enjoy it, in the long  run, more than Seattle. It just feels nicer and the lack of standard zoning in  sections means that some of the neighborhoods seem very livable on foot with the  mixture of restaurants, other businesses, houses and other activities. Even  going downtown for Powell's, the skank factor didn't compare remotely with  Seattle's. I didn't even feel like I needed to worry much about my car getting  busted into, etc. I know it happens but everything just seemed a bit turned down  in that area. A lot of people have commented to me before about how Portland is  a lot like the Seattle of my childhood before all the growth and immigration by  non-Washingtonians.
