Here are two ways to set up proxies (one for Windows, one for OS X):

I would also suggest the easy option of setting up a <a href="http://tor.eff.org/">Tor</a> node. This adds to the overall goodness of the Tor network anyway.

Anonymous, strangely enough, seems to be interested in helping as well (<a href="http://iran.whyweprotest.net/">http://iran.whyweprotest.net/</a>). Their site has a nice forum with all sorts of information geared more towards the less skilled (which is really necessary), as well as helping people track what is going on. They are using Tor Hidden Services as well, which is a sort of parasitic Internet running within the Tor network.
