Through <a href="http://www.tricycle.com/">Tricycle magazine's website</a>, Stephen Batchelor has been running an "online retreat" called "<a href="http://www.tricycle.com/online-retreats/buddhism-one-and-only-life">Buddhism for this One and Only Life</a>." This seems to consist largely of video presentations by him, rather than some of more interactive online retreats that I've seen from some Zen teachers. Examples of teachers doing such things are <a href="http://wildfoxzen.blogspot.com/">Dosho Port</a> or <a href="http://www.treeleaf.org/">Jundo Cohen</a>, who are both doing a lot of good work. Tricycle wants one to be a subscriber in order to watch the videos so I've only seen the first one, which is free. I found it interesting enough to suggest to others as something to spend 25 minutes watching and you can see it <a href="http://www.tricycle.com/online-retreats/buddhism-one-and-only-life/awakening-life-awakening-death">here</a>. I see that Ken McLeod is also running a Tricycle online retreat, <a href="http://www.tricycle.com/online-retreats/way-freedom-0">The Way to Freedom</a>. You can see the first video <a href="http://www.tricycle.com/online-retreats/way-freedom/way-freedom-week-1">here</a> for free as well. ("<em>Hey kid, the first one's free...</em>") Given how much free content, even from both of these teachers, there is online, I'm not sure if there is much reason to pay for a Tricycle subscription or access unless one is interested in Tricycle magazine. I've generally found it of only marginal interest but I find a lot of the content produced by the Buddhist media in America to be targeted at a much different audience (*cough* <em>aging boomers</em> *cough*) than me and, therefore, pretty boring, often bringing the opposite of awakening. Ken McLeod has an ongoing, very good, podcast <a href="http://www.unfetteredmind.org/audio/">available</a> that includes audio from many of the retreats that he teachers. He comes at things from the perspective of the Vajrayana. Stephen Batchelor did a retreat recently at <a href="http://www.upaya.org">Upaya Zen Center</a>. You can find the audio online <a href="http://www.upaya.org/dharma/tag/godless-religion-or-devout-atheism/">here</a> for it. Upaya Zen Center maintains a <a href="http://www.upaya.org/dharma/">vast archive</a> of audio material from their retreats as well, which you can subscribe to as a podcast. I've found their content to be exceptional as well.
