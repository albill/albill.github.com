Madeline, my daughter, and my mother will be visiting the Bay Area for Thanksgiving weekend. I'm looking at going up to Seattle for Christmas. Currently, I'm thinking of arriving on Friday evening, the 22nd, and leaving late on the 26th, which will give me four days in Seattle. Along with seeing my grandparents and my daughter for Christmas Day (which is traditional in the family), I'd like to see other friends and such. I'm also trying my best to avoid staying with my grandparents in their retirement community (shudder) but it is over Christmas weekend... Friends who would like to get together should get in touch with me by the normal means.
