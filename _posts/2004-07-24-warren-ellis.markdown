                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <strong>Ultimate Fantastic Four</strong> for Marvel, he's going to be doing <strong>Iron Man</strong>.

Think of <strong>Iron Man</strong> with Spider Jerusalem's sense of justice or Elijah Snow's desire to really shake things up with the powers behind the scenes.
