Sweet. Warren Ellis wrote me back within ten minutes when I e-mailed him
and asked him if I can call him "corporate shill-boy" now... He
announced today that in addition to writing **Ultimate Fantastic Four**
for Marvel, he's going to be doing **Iron Man**. I think Warren doing
Iron Man has some real fucked up potential. Think of **Iron Man** with
Spider Jerusalem's sense of justice or Elijah Snow's desire to really
shake things up with the powers behind the scenes. Hmm. *For non-geeks,
those are comics references...*
