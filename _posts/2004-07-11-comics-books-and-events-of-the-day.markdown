<p>I'm getting a little reading in this weekend. On Friday, I started and finished <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0765304368/">Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</a></b> by Cory Doctorow. I hadn't actually gotten around to reading more than the first chapter before but it is a short work and I read it cover to cover in a few hours. I read his<b> Eastern Standard Tribe</b> from a reviewer's copy before it came out, strangely enough.</p><p>Later last night, I started reading Charles Stross' <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1930846258/">The Atrocity Archives</a></b>, which is his Cthulhu meets Computer Geeks meets Spry Thrillers book. I'm only about 50 pages into that though. I read <b>Singularity Sky</b> a month or two ago and I've been waiting for my copy of <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441011594/">Iron Sunrise</a></b> (its sequel) to arrive. I should have just bought it at the U Bookstore today. I made the mistake of ordering it from Amazon the day it was released (it said &quot;usually ships in 24 hours&quot;), on Wednesday, and I'm still waiting for it to ship. The fucks. Never trust <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=Jim+Bezos&btnG=Google+Search">Jim Bezos</a> to ship you anything on time. This happened the last time I pre-ordered something as well. All of my friends had it and were reading it while I was sitting around waiting for my book...</p><p>In any case, Doctorow and Stross are both of a breed: computer geeks who have turned into science fiction writers. There's probably a few more out there that I'm not thinking of (oh, yeah, Ken Schroeder). It's interesting to read fiction loaded with geek in-jokes, slashdot-type references, and technical terminology that is actually correct or mostly so. We'll see how well it dates in 20 years though. Neither goes completely overboard with it in my opinion but I'm definitely the target demographic.</p>

<p>Today was a pretty quiet day. I slept in until 10:00 or so after staying up late. R and I were supposed to go to a BBQ at my friend Sarastro's place as he was picking up our mutual friend, Danae, who is in the area from Eugene, OR. Unfortunately, due to car troubles and lack of easy communication, this wound up not happening. R and I puttered around the house a bit in the early afternoon and then went out. We drove down to the University District and visited the comic shop of my friend, Aaron, <b>The Dreaming</b>. While there, I picked up a copy of <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1568821298/">The Book of Eibon</a></b>, which is Cthulhu mythos related stories and materials largely done by Clark Ashton Smith or inspired by his work. Along with the copy of <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1568821301/">Nameless Cults</a></b> by Robert E. Howard that R gifted me with the other year, this brings some of my more Cthulhu-related materials to completion.</p><p>A quick stop by Thai Tom's (best Thai food in Seattle and worth the wait!) and Tully's armed us with food and coffee to continue our big city adventures.</p><p><img border="1" src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/highbury-working-web.jpg" width="200" height="200" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2">I'd been looking for some of Alan Moore's CD projects but Aaron has not had much luck getting them for me. I have recalled, off and on, that the comic store in Wallingford had one of them last year but figured that they were long gone as this stuff is largely out of print now. Since we were nearby, I persuaded R to go over there and we arrived 15 minutes before closing. Lo and behold, they had it still! So, I picked up a copy of <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000056UVI/">The Highbury Working: Beat Seance</a></b> by Alan Moore and Tim Perkins. This is a recording of a ritual/musical/spoken word performance by Alan Moore accompanied by images and, I believe, a dancer. This was done as part of a series of magical and ritual performances in London that Moore had planned. My understanding, based on interviews, is that he plans on continuing to do more of this sort of work, rather than the comics work that has earned him his fame up until the current point.</p><p>Following the surge of shopping, R and I went over to Ballard in search of recreation and sugary confections. Arriving in the mid-evening, we found most things closed. We did discover that this Saturday is the Artwalk in Ballard and took this as an opportunity to walk the streets for a while, ducking into and out of places and generally having a nice time wandering around. Looking for movie options and finding them lacking, we picked up <b>The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra</b> and <b>Secret Window</b> to watch at a rental place. We watched the latter this evening, which I must report as disappointing and predictable fare, as nice as it is to watch Johnny Depp act. I would have preferred to have watched <b>Pirates of the Caribbean</b> again instead. </p><p>Now that the hour has grown late, I'm just doing this record of the days events before, probably, retiring before it starts to get light outside. Too much coffee, on supposes.</p>
