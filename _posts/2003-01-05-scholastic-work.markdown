While looking through the website for <a href="http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/">Esoterica</a>, I found a link for <a href="http://www.aseweb.org/">The Association for the Study of Esotericism</a>.

Here is what little information is available. This is an association within my academic interests if it manages to survive...

<strong>Announcing a New Scholarly Organization:
The Association for the Study of Esotericism [ASE]</strong>
For more information on the ASE and our conference in June, 2004, see our website at http://www.aseweb.org

If your areas of academic research touch on such subjects as alchemy, astrology, Freemasonry, Gnosticism, Hermeticism, Kabbalah, magic, mysticism, Neoplatonism, new religious movements related to these historical currents, nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first century occult movements, Rosicrucianism, and secret or semi-secret societies, please contact us at studies@esoteric.msu.edu to place your name, academic position, and research interests in the ASE database of scholars and to receive information on our coming academic conference in June, 2004. We welcome scholars of esotericism from a wide range of perspectives, including anthropology, American studies, art history, history, history of religions, literature, philosophy, religious studies, sociology—the full range of academic disciplines and fields. This is an interdisciplinary field of research, and we believe everyone will benefit from the cross-fertilization of perspectives.

Among ASE’s immediate goals are its first North American conference in June, 2004, a related scholarly volume of invited chapters, and a database of North American scholars in the field. The conference will feature online publication of all papers accepted for and presented at it.

Currently, the ASE is only in its formative stages, but if you are a scholar interested in being listed in our growing database, please complete the database form to be found at http://www.aseweb.org/database.htm We will be in touch as the ASE continues to develop.

<strong>Background</strong>

In May, 2002, the journal Esoterica hosted the First North American Symposium on the Study of Esotericism at Michigan State University. There, the invited participants created a new scholarly organization, the Association for the Study of Esotericism [ASE], along with a mission statement and a set of goals. This organization subsequently was incorporated in August, 2002, as a recognized 501(c)3 non-profit organization. The primary mission of this organization is to support excellence in scholarship and to foster communication among scholars who, though their work originates from a wide range of fields, find esotericism a common theme of their research.

<strong>ASE Mission</strong>

The mission of the Association for the Study of Esotericism is to promote excellence in scholarship and teaching in the study of esotericism and mysticism. This is to be accomplished through conferences and meetings, publications, programs, and
membership services.

Within a context of free inquiry and critical examination, the Association welcomes all disciplined reflection on esotericism in its various manifestations from antiquity to the present--including perspectives ranging from historiographic to phenomenological--and seeks to enhance the broad public understanding of this emerging field.

<strong>ASE Goals</strong>

To accomplish its mission the Association for the Study of Esotericism has identified the following goals:

1. To help to advance and secure the future of the academic study of esotericism.
2. To promote research and scholarship in the study of esotericism.
3. To foster excellence in teaching in the field of esotericism.
4. To support and encourage members' professional development.
5. To advance publication and scholarly communication in the study of esotericism and mysticism.
6. To contribute to the public understanding of esoteric movements, groups, individuals, and the historical currents that they represent.
