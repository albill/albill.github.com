I was told this morning that I received an 'A' on the paper that I just
turned in the other day. This gives me an 'A' for my **Para-Rational
Perspectives** class. No word yet on **The Individual and Society**,
which is being run by my thesis mentor. I expect that I will get an 'A'
there unless the worlds are misaligned. This next term I'm taking
**Greeks: Philosophy, Tragedy and the Polis**, which is an overview of
aspects of Greek philosophy and drama with a longer, self-directed,
research paper. I'm also doing my self-designed Independent Study
**Methodologies and Recent Research on Western Esotericism**. The
purpose of the latter is, per my proposal:

> This independent study will focus on gaining an understanding of the
> recent work done in the study of Western Esotericism and the
> methodologies used in this study. Western Esotericism is an
> interdisciplinary area of research within the Humanities incorporating
> the fields of History, Literature, Religious Studies, and Philosophy.
> It is a relatively new discipline which has only gained many adherents
> over the last 20 years.My current plan for my thesis is to study
> specific twentieth century Western Esoteric groups and their
> religious/spiritual beliefs that derive from the English "Hermetic
> Order of the Golden Dawn" in the English speaking world. In order to
> do this work, I need to have a solid grasp on the methodologies used
> to study Western Esoteric groups and the current research on such
> groups within academia. Since this is a relatively new area of study,
> the literature is fairly limited. I have gathered the best available
> in my list of texts below. Texts for this Independent Study

> 20th century in Europe and America. Read Book One, Part Two of Access

> Imagination, Tradition (the Theosophical Current section). This is due
