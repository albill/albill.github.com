I was told this morning that I received an 'A' on the paper that I just turned in the other day. This gives me an 'A' for my <strong>Para-Rational Perspectives</strong> class. No word yet on <strong>The Individual and Society</strong>, which is being run by my thesis mentor. I expect that I will get an 'A' there unless the worlds are misaligned.

This next term I'm taking <strong>Greeks: Philosophy, Tragedy and the Polis</strong>, which is an overview of aspects of Greek philosophy and drama with a longer, self-directed, research paper. I'm also doing my self-designed Independent Study <strong>Methodologies and Recent Research on Western Esotericism</strong>.

The purpose of the latter is, per my proposal:
<blockquote>This independent study will focus on gaining an understanding of the recent work done in the study of Western Esotericism and the methodologies used in this study. Western Esotericism is an interdisciplinary area of research within the Humanities incorporating the fields of History, Literature, Religious Studies, and Philosophy. It is a relatively new discipline which has only gained many adherents over the last 20 years.My current plan for my thesis is to study specific twentieth century Western Esoteric groups and their religious/spiritual beliefs that derive from the English "Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn" in the English speaking world. In order to do this work, I need to have a solid grasp on the methodologies used to study Western Esoteric groups and the current research on such groups within academia. Since this is a relatively new area of study, the literature is fairly limited. I have gathered the best available in my list of texts below.

<u>Texts for this Independent Study</u>

	<li>Faivre, Antoine. <u>Theosophy, Imagination, Tradition: Studies in Western Esotericism</u>. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2000.</li>

	<li>Hanegraaff, Wouter. <u>New Age Religion and Western Culture: Esotericism in the Mirror of Secular Thought</u>. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1997.</li>
</ul>
For this class, I plan to write three papers of ten pages each.

The papers will cover the following:

<strong> 	</strong><strong>Paper 1: Definition of Western Esotericism</strong>. Read <u>Modern Esoteric  	Spirituality</u> and  <u>New Age Religion and Western Culture</u>.  	Define the characteristics of Western Esotericism using specific examples  	from the books. Discuss its relationship with mainstream or exoteric  	spirituality and culture. This is due at the end of Week 5.

<strong> 	</strong><strong>Paper 2: History</strong>. Discuss the history of  and currents of  	thought within Western Esotericism in the 19th and early 20th century in  	Europe and America. Read Book One, Part Two of <u>Access to Western  	Esotericism</u> and the first four chapters of <u>Theosophy, Imagination,  	Tradition</u> (the Theosophical Current section). This is due at the end of  	Week 10.

<strong> 	</strong><strong>Paper 3: Methodology</strong>. Read the rest of <u>Access to Western  	Esotericism</u> in its entirety and all of <u>Western Esotericism and the  	Science of Religion</u>. Discuss the methodologies and terminology used in  	studying Western Esotericism in current academic work. This is due at the  	end of Week 15</blockquote>
