I am at the Cincinnati airport now (which Jim tells me is actually in Kentucky...). My flight doesn't leave for home for about three hours. Jim had to drop me off early for scheduling reasons with Daiun-Ji's activities today (that is the center here that he is running).

Yesterday, two of us went through the Jukai ceremony and received our rakusus, our new dharma names, and the five lay precepts. My name is Japanese (as are they all) and it is 'Shogen.' Following the ceremony and the short yet witty talk by Jim, we all went to a nice early supper.

Afterwards, I went back to the house with Jim where we have been studying and practicing. At 2:00 AM this morning, we continued. After the sessions today, I am feeling much comfotable with the material. I realized that we have done seven sessions since early Friday morning, which works to around 21 hours of my going through the work repeatedly. Wow. It doesn't seem like it was over twenty hours but it is...

I really appreciate the time that Jim took to spend with me. He completely disrupted his day to day life since Thursday (if not before) in order to teach me. This is along inviting me into his home with his family. I have been very fortunate to be given a chance to do this by him.

That is it for now. I am off in search of food or coffee.
