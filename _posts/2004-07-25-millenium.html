I just watched the first four episodes of 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <strong>Millenium</strong> back to back with R. I haven't seen any of these since, oh, 1999 or something. It's hard to believe that it has been about eight years since that show first started. R has never seen any of it before. Frank Black seeing the darkness in the souls of men. It is gloomy to watch but I still like it. The second season is my favorite but I figure it will be a while until we get to it (or I do if R begs off). It's too bad that Chris Carter had to fuck with the format and change a lot of the basic direction every season in his quest for market share (that never really materialized...). <p align="center">
