As many of my friends know, I'm a Bruce Sterling fanboy. I took great
umbrage recently when one of my friends informed me that "Bruce Sterling
is an asshole...not as bad as Harlan Ellison, but still an asshole." He
rolled his eyes at me when I said in the couple of times I'd seen Bruce
Speak and from the speeches, interviews, and casual interactions that
I've either heard or read, he doesn't seem too much like a prick (and,
hell, I should know). That being said, I do like a lot of Bruce's work
and find him insightful, amusing, and entertaining in equal degrees.
Today, I found a couple of recent (November, 2005) items that I hadn't
come across before. From Tweakfest 2005, there is this entry with
Bruce's speech there:

Tweakfest was some kind of gathering in Zurich recently. Their site is
at [http://www.tweakfest.ch/v2/](http://www.tweakfest.ch/v2/) but they
don't seem to have an English language version. One blog characterizes
it as "Tweakfest aims at initiating a discourse on the “Digital
Lifestyle”. **[Artcast](http://artcast.twoday.net/stories/1143418/)**
has another speech by Bruce available as well:

> Patrik calls up Barbara for the intro and catches her @ [the
> mitte](http://www.mitte.ch/). She explains where we met Bruce
> Sterling: @ the first edition of [the
> tweakfest](http://www.tweakfest.ch/). And she uncovers what's her
> connection to him. Then a hard switch over to the interview, where
> Bruce talks about "black globalization", the chances for a "positive
> al kaida", his impressions of Zurich and the role Switzerland as a
> country could play in the world. [Listen and

Enjoy!
