As many of my friends know, I'm a Bruce Sterling fanboy. I took great umbrage  recently when one of my friends informed me that "Bruce Sterling is an  asshole...not as bad as Harlan Ellison, but still an asshole." He rolled his  eyes at me when I said in the couple of times I'd seen Bruce Speak and from the  speeches, interviews, and casual interactions that I've either heard or read, he  doesn't seem too much like a prick (and, hell, I should know).

That being said, I do like a lot of Bruce's work and find him insightful,  amusing, and entertaining in equal degrees.

Today, I found a couple of recent (November, 2005) items that I hadn't come  across before.

From Tweakfest 2005, there is this entry with Bruce's speech there:
<blockquote><h3> 					<a href="http://blog.invisible.ch/cgi-bin/mt-tb.cgi?__mode=view&entry_id=482"> 					Tweakfest - The Bruce Sterling speech as mp3</a></h3> Both Bruce Sterling as well as the organizers of  					Tweakfest have allowed me to publish a recording of the  					speech that Bruce Sterling gave at this years Tweakfest.

It was recorded using my Powerbook and it's built in  					microphone, so sound quality is, let's say "challenged".  					Still, Bruce can be understood without problems.

Enjoy: 					<a href="http://blog.invisible.ch/files/Tweakfest-BruceSterling.mp3"> 					Bruce Sterling at Tweakfest 05</a> (24 MB, mp3, length  					57:10)</blockquote>
Tweakfest was some kind of gathering in Zurich recently. Their site is at <a href="http://www.tweakfest.ch/v2/">http://www.tweakfest.ch/v2/</a> but they  don't seem to have an English language version. One blog characterizes it as "Tweakfest  aims at initiating a discourse on the “Digital Lifestyle”.

<strong><a href="http://artcast.twoday.net/stories/1143418/">Artcast</a></strong> has  another speech by Bruce available as well:
<blockquote><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/tsup/artcast/ac-2005-11-11.mp3">In this  	ArtCast</a>: Patrik calls up Barbara for the intro and catches her @ 	<a href="http://www.mitte.ch/">the mitte</a>. She explains  	where we met Bruce Sterling: @ the first edition of 	<a href="http://www.tweakfest.ch/">the tweakfest</a>. And she  	uncovers what's her connection to him. Then a hard switch over to the  	interview, where Bruce talks about "black globalization", the chances for a  	"positive al kaida", his impressions of Zurich and the role Switzerland as a  	country could play in the world. 	<a href="http://homepage.mac.com/tsup/artcast/ac-2005-11-11.mp3">
Listen and enjoy</a>!</blockquote>
Enjoy!
