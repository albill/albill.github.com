Needless to say, I'm back and I survived California. I thought it amusing that the plane was mostly empty going down there and completely full coming back. More people leaving than going, perhaps? :-)

As always, I felt like I had a cold within a day of air travel. I've had a good night's sleep since I got back so I feel much better though.

I need to try to knock out a paper this weekend so I can be completely done with one of my classes (my Independent Study). My professor is finally back from filming his documentary on the background behind the Da Vinci Code so I should get my previous papers returned soon.

On Sunday, R and I will be going to see Mike Daisey monologue on L. Ron Hubbard at the <a href="http://www.capitolhillarts.com/">Capitol Hill Arts Center</a>. My friend, John, from work is getting a bunch of people to go.
