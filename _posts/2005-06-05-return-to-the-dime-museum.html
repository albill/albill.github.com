<img src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/pyramid.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="408" width="300" />On Friday night, R and I went with Denny Sargent and Sophia to see the opening night of <a href="http://www.circuscontraption.com/home.html">Circus Contraption</a>'s new show, <strong>Return to the Dime Museum</strong>. Circus Contraption is a local, one ring circus that was, I believe, originally started as a hobby by a group of people interested in performing about six years ago. We've been going annually for a few years and know one of the performers.

Circus Contraption is known for its inappropriate sick humor, for rather adult jokes and just, all-around, being the kind of place that would give most Republicans nightmares about the death of American family values or the like. In other words, it is the kind of thing that most of my friends would love.

As the first night of the new show, it was a "Pay What You Can" night. I paid the full, normal, $20 price because I wanted to help them out. The guy in front of me (who was one of the first in line) paid a whole dollar. That was an amusing exchange to watch:

Guy: "I only have a dollar. I thought I had more but that's all that was in my pocket."

Ticket Lady: "Normally, we request a minimum of $5."

Guy: "But it's 'Pay What You Can', right? Well, I have a dollar."

Ticket Lady: "There is an ATM a block away if you want to get cash."

Guy: "I'm paying a dollar."

(This all took place about 40 minutes <strong>before</strong> they were going to let us in to sit so the guy had lots of time...)

As he walks away and the next people come up, the Ticket Lady told the next people that they could pay what they wanted "Just like Mr. Dollar over there." People proceeded to quietly and discuss the fellow, who looked like a wild hermit type (not a street person) that you'd avoid on the bus. Later, R enjoyed seeing him brushing his teeth upstairs at the sink near the bathroom.

Eventually, he went away and came back and seemed to give them some loose change (dimes and quarters) or something.

During the show, the MC was doing a vaudeville patter on stage and said "...and you can pay what you like for this show. In fact, one man paid an entire dollar to see the show. Let me tell you buddy, you're going to get your money's worth tonight!" to much laughter. Of course, the fellow was sitting right behind us so I didn't get a chance to see the expression on his face but I bet it was priceless.

Moral of the story: Don't fuck with Carnies when they want you to pay up. They'll get it in money or mockery, one way or the other.

As to the show, it was great. I don't think I've grinned so much or laughed so hard for so long this year. Seriously. My personal high point was the part where we were looking into your typical freak shop with a Fijian Mermaid and such and Dr. Calimari pulls the cover off of the table to reveal...three head-sized preserved embryos in large jars (obviously fake looking). These proceed to bounce up and down as simple puppets. While we were laughing at this, the song number begins with the three of them singing (in harmony) about how they want their mummy and wish that they had arms to hug with... I tell you, I can't do it justice.

There were many excellent acts of songs, dance, trapeze, lewd humor, bicycle races, and many others. They all flowed together out of this 19th century theme and the cast was just wonderful. I encourage everyone to go. As they said, "Tell your family! Tell your friends! Hell, tell people you hate! They should all come give us their money!"

An enjoyable show.
