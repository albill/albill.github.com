I just saw this on <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/journal.asp">Neil Gaiman's weblog</a>:
<blockquote>Hello Mr. Gaiman,My name is Pamela Kipnes and I am the Marketing Manager for A&E Home Video/New Video. Through our deal with the BBC, A&E Home Video will release Neverwhere on DVD in a 2 pack set in June 2003. We are all very excited about this project, and I was hoping that you might want to be involved. If you were interested, I'd love to hear your thoughts on potential DVD bonus features, plus any other marketing or promotional ideas you might have.

I'll look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,
Pamela Kipnes</blockquote>
<strong>Woot!</strong>

It's about time...
