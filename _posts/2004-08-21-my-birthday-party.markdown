<p>My birthday was on Thursday, the 19th. I am 33 years old now. On a good day, 
my life may be a third over (or I could be killed in a freak computer mouse 
incident in Halo tomorrow). </p>
<p>R and I decided to have a little gathering at our place on the day after 
work. &quot;Little&quot; in this instance seems to translate to about 25 people in my 
living area and deck. Surprisingly, just about everyone that we invited, with a 
couple of noted exceptions, made it out to the house. I, also, for almost the 
first time, invited coworkers that I am friends with to the event and exposed 
them to my slightly odd, and occasionally Satanic, friends. This included my 
boss (though I took pains to not introduce him as such) and my friend John and 
his girlfriend. The rest of the crew was a mix of Ordo Templi Orientis people, a 
couple of other Thelemic types, Sarastro, my fellow Aurum Solis initiate, a 
Wiccan High Priestess, a Syncretic Gnostic Christian and one person trying very 
hard to be a Catholic. &lt;grin&gt; There was a couple of others that fall outside of 
such categories as well and two published authors...</p>
<p>It&#39;s probably amusing that I describe most friends by their religious or 
spiritual inclinations and affiliations but it is one of the primary modes that 
I know people within, given my own interests and orientation.</p>
<p>Quite a few of our guests hadn&#39;t been in the house since our housewarming 
event last August, about six weeks after we moved in, and some had never been 
there. I showed a few people around. People seemed to like some of the art that 
we had up on the walls. Our art tends to fall in roughly four categories:</p>
<ol>
	<li>&quot;Occult&quot; art, such as the Egyptian or Cabalistic pieces.</li>
	<li>Buddhist art, such as my Thangkas, Rupas (Buddhist statues) and framed 
	images of deities and the like.</li>
	<li>Greek pieces brought back from our trip in 2003 to Greece.</li>
	<li>R&#39;s pieces, either bought on other trips, created by friends, or gifted 
	to her by others.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of the art is very nice and I&#39;ll admit that some might be considered odd 
or even dorky by some people but it is ours and we like it.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t specifically request presents from people and, when I spoke to 
people, I made it clear that they didn&#39;t need to bring me anything (not that I&#39;d 
turn them down). I didn&#39;t want people to feel that the party was about my 
receiving gifts when it was really about the event and having people over. 
Nevertheless, some people did bring me gifts. Especially noteworthy was the foot 
and something tall Baphomet statue that Manaman brought for me. That was a 
popular one with the Thelemic crowd. Beyond that, I received some books, 
flowers, gift certificates to a couple of places, an iTrip for my iPod, a 
journal, some goofy stuff from Archie McPhee&#39;s, massage oil, more books, and, of 
super-special note, a DVD collection of <b>
<a href="http://www.illwillpress.com">Neurotically Yours</a></b> aka the Foamy 
comic!!!! I was even wearing my Foamy t-shirt when I received this...</p>
<p>Strangely, no photos were taken so you&#39;ll have to take my word on all of 
this. </p>
<p>Today, we&#39;re off to the White Trash Birthday being thrown by A&amp;O for this 
birthday.</p>
