Lovecraft Triptych of Terror</strong> Directed by Sean McEnaney, Rob D'Arc & Matt Fontaine Written by Lyam White, Ron Sandahl, H.P. Lovecraft Running Dates: Oct. 3, 2003 - Nov. 8, 2003 Description: Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn indeed! Oh, those pesky Deep Ones! Three OCT company members will adapt three of H.P. Lovecraft’s tales of horror for the stage, where three separate directors will interpret them using one unified cast. The soul-shattering terror of the evening is guaranteed to make all who attend question their sanity and the very boundaries of reality itself! And did I mention that there would be puppets?
