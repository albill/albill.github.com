It is time to get cracking on my thesis.

I need to do a literature review to create my final bibliography and to get a better sense of how to approach my thesis focusing on the ritual/spiritual practices of Golden Dawn magicians and self-deification or self-perfection within these. As you may have read before, my thesis statement is “What is the role of self-cultivation in the practices and beliefs of the Golden Dawn, its immediate successors and their members?” This may be refined into a slightly different statement by the time that I am done with my current work.

My copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ritual-Process-Structure-Anti-Structure-Lectures/dp/0202011909/"><strong>The Ritual Process</strong></a> by Dr. Victor Turner arrived tonight. I also have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/-Place-Enchantment-British-Occultism-Culture-Modern/dp/0226642011"><strong>The Place of Enchantment: British Occultism and the Culture of the Modern</strong></a> by Alex Owen. These are two texts that I will look at first.

Following this, I'm going to look at Gavin Flood's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/052160401X/"><strong>The Ascetic Self: Subjectivity, Memory and Tradition</strong></a> and some of the essays in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0907845258/"><strong>The View from Within: First-person approaches to the Study of Conscisioness</strong></a>.

I also need to review the Golden Dawn books and flying rolls to look at what the Golden Dawn directly taught its members as an explanation framing the work of aspirants.
I need to complete a literature review of the sources that I am going to use. Following the above books, I need to look at any first person accounts by Golden Dawn members or members of immediate successor groups about the practices they engaged in, especially within a curriculum of organized study, and what they thought they were doing. I am going to look through the writings of Aleister Crowley and Dion Fortune, for example, and see what they had to say about it.

If anyone has any suggestions for sources to look at in any of these areas or in academia, I'd love to hear about them.
