A lot of "cheaper" digital SLR cameras have been coming into the market
during the last year. I am interested in moving beyond the land of my
little point and shoot Fujifilm Finepix camera for a "real" digital
camera. Of course, I know sweet FA about photography so I'm going to
have to actually learn the skills to operate such a camera if I get one.
Does anyone have any suggestions for a decent digital SLR camera in the
cheaper range for the dedicate amateur or hobbyist? I've heard decent
things about some of the new Canon "Digital Rebel" models. Since I'm
going to Egypt in October with R for our annual trip, I'd like to get
something and practice a bit with it in the hope of taking some nicer
pictures of the various tombs and temples while we're there. Within the
realm of point and shoot still, I've heard good things about the [Sigma
DP1 14MP Digital
Camera](http://www.amazon.com/Sigma-DP1-14MP-Digital-Camera/dp/B0013DCOZC/).
I have read that it has issues with speed (slow to focus, slow to store
shots) but has very high quality for a point and shoot camera. Of
course, it costs almost as much as the Canon XSi DSLR camera. It is hard
to say what makes the most sense for me and for the photos that I want
to talk. Nice cameras cost a lot of money though. **Update:** My friend,
John Mueller, advises me to get one of the Canon's. He has an older
generation of the Digital Rebel and has quite liked it but wishes he had
a 40D, which is a nearly $1,000 camera when I looked.
