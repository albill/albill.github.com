I just got my grades for my two classes that ended last week (well, I had one of them before but whatever...). I received a 4.0 in each class (an 'A' for people not used to that system). My official transcript now shows that I have completed 15 semester credits in my 30 credit program. I am halfway through and my overall GPA is 4.0. I have two classes next term with one being my independent study on Western Esotericism and methodology. The following term I have one normal class and a thesis prep class. After that, I just write my thesis. So, by next August, I should be working on my thesis for my MA. Good news!
