I'm trying to remember a poem... I know it is well known and I've read
it within the last year. I've heard it quoted off and on so I know it
gets around. I don't remember how any of the lines go exactly (or I'd be
able to find it). The narrator (or poet) speaks about how our strength
is not the strength of old (or the old heroes or gods) but what strength
we have, we have. He speaks about enduring and striving with what we do
have. If anyone can recognize it from what little I can really recall,
I'd appreciate you telling me.
