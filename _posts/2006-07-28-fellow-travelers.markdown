I just got back from having chicken and waffles with Sean
([http://www.seanomlor.com](http://www.seanomlor.com/)). Sean works
swing shift about two miles from my place so we agreed to meet a little
bit after 11:00 PM, when he got off from work. Sean is an artist and a
fellow traveler of sorts. We met through [Zaadz](http://www.zaadz.com/),
the socail networking site. Zaadz is kind of "Tribe meets the Integral
Institute" space. I copy much of my blog content there and it forms its
own closed (or not so closed) community of generally spiritually
interested folks. Sean gave me a point earlier today to the [Sixth
Patriarch Zen Center](http://www.zenhall.org/Pages/home.html), a Korean
zen center in Berkeley. I've been looking for a group to sit with once a
week though R and I still need to visit the New Dharma Center that I
wrote about last week. Sean also mentioned the [Yoga Mandala
Studio](http://www.yogamandalastudio.com/) as a good place to practice
(though not for Buddhism specifically). It was a good chat for about an
hour and a half. We'll have to get together again soon. Since it is late
and I have to be at work within the next eight hours, I'm going to bed
now.
