I bought music and I will face the music...

<img src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/claytee.gif" align="right" border="1" height="173" width="216" />This evening, I decided to stop by a local music store on a whim after work. On another whim, I looked under "C17H19NO3", which was a side project of Trust Obey's John Bergin of years ago. It was a kind of dark, ambient soundscape project. I found that he had just reissued his old CD "Terra Damnata" as a remastered double-CD set with another CD "Terra Null." Since I trashed my copy of Terra Damnata through my own stupidity years ago and never found it on MP3, I snatched this up quick. I'm ripping copies of the CDs now and am feeling quite happy to have picked it up. It's cool stuff. A little websearching turned up <a href="http://www.grindertool.com/c17.html">this url</a> for the project. Bergin is the only person I know of to turn a character from an Elizabeth Hand book into a song.

John Bergin is quite the interesting artist. His original project was "Trust Obey" and he got to team up with Trent Reznor back in the day for it. After repeatedly butting heads and Reznor telling him his stuff had no commercial potential, Bergin left with his music and put it out on his own. It was reasonably popular in a small scale and Bergin liked to stick negative quotes from Reznor on stickers on his albums. Bergin did a soundtrack for the Crow comic book that was issued on a CD with the deluxe reissue a while before the movie was created. He's also a visual artist and has at least one comic out that he's done.

As to facing the music, tomorrow I get my annual review from my boss. Microsoft has this graded system for annual reviews where he get judged against your peers in your group and division on a curve. I have no reason to think I'll do badly but I'm not convinced that I'll do super well. I had about as good of a review as anyone normally gets for the last two years before this so I don't particularly want to screw this one. Leaving that aside, how much of a bonus, pay increase and stock you get is all based on this and who doesn't want more cash? ;-)
