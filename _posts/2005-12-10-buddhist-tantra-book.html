I received a copy of <strong>The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan  Esotericism</strong> by Alex Wayman today. It had been recommended to me in the same  conversation as Stephen Beyer's <strong>Cult of Tara</strong> so I figured it might be  good. It is supposed to be back in print but I found a hardcover from a few  years ago via Powell's in Portland.

The flap describes it as:
<blockquote>Based on over third years research, <em>The Buddhist Tantras</em> includes  	much material not easily available elsewhere in Western language sources.  	This includes such matters as the tantric theory of divinity, classification  	of offering materials, authoritative symbolism of the mandala-palace, an  	explanation of tantric ritual, the tantric teaching about the body's nine  	orifices, and the theory of female energy in Buddhist tantras.

The book has been divided into four parts. Part One, the Introduction,  	places the position of the Buddhist tantras within Mahayana Buddhism and  	recalls their early literary history, especially the Guhyasamahatantra, as  	well as examining Buddhist Genesis and the tantric tradition and the  	analogical thinking in Buddhist tantras. In Part Two, the author discusses the foundations of the Buddhist tantras,  	considering the tantric presentation of divinity; the preparation of  	disciples and the meaning of initiation, tantric ritual and the symbolism of  	its attainments, and twilight language. Part Three is devoted to special studies which are very rarely available  	to the general reader, such as the tantric teachings of the inner zodiac and  	the five-fold ritual symbolism of passion. Part Four contains a correlation between the tantric portions of the <em> 	Kanjur</em> and the <em>Tanjur</em>.

Throughout the work, Alex Wayman demonstrates his unique knowledge of  	tantric literature, and shares with the reader his sympathetic researches in  	these recondite texts.

The Author

Alex Wayman, former Professor of Sanskrit, Columbia University, New York  	is one of the world's leading authorities on tantric and non-tantric  	Buddhism. He employs both Sanskrit and Tibetan languages in his books and  	articles, and is the author of many seminal works on the Buddhist tantras.</blockquote>
