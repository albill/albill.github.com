I tend to have stuff on my door at work. I used to have a whole bunch of comics from <a href="http://www.redmeat.com">RedMeat</a> which appropriately disturbed many coworkers but only enough to ensure "freak" status amongst the test leads and test organization, not enough to get me narc'd out to HR (read: The Political Office) for a tallking too. I took those down a while back because we were moving to a new building and my door has been empty since then. Yesterday, I decided to put some stuff up again. One of the performance testers who is on the other side of the hall from me said "Oh crap, you're putting stuff on your door again." as soon as he saw me there cutting papers and with a roll of tape. I found this amusing because I'm not putting anything truly disturbing up this time. I put up some images/diagrams and text about <a href="http://www.aula.cc">Aula</a>, the Finnish cybercommunity that also has its own space and system for people to meet in a collective manner for discussion, art, presentations, etc. I find "Third Places" fascinating. If you don't know the term, it is for those places that are neither work nor home that we congregate in or use socially. Think of your local coffeehouse, think of the bar in "Cheers," that sort of thing. Social spaces. I've spent a fair amount of my adult life meeting friends in spaces like this and I've had a draw to them, how they are organized, their function, for quite some time. I've often thought of owning some kind of space and the uses it could be put towards in community. On another note, my birthday is this coming Monday. I'm not allowed to buy much stuff for myself (regardless of the bonus I get today) until after then or will hurt me. I did order some used Buddhist books by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index%3Dbooks%26field-author%3DGyatso%2C%20Geshe%20Kelsang/">Geshe Kelsang Gyatso</a> (who is on the outs with a chunk of the Dharma world but I won't get into that) such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/094800634X/">Tantric Grounds and Paths: How to Enter, Progress On, and Complete the Vajrayana Path</a>. His books on various Tantric topics have been highly recommended to me and I have his book on Vajrayogini and have been impressed by it. You can find used hardcover editions (which I like) for much cheaper than his new paperbacks so I ordered a few of them this last week. <a href="http://www.cabiri.org">The Cabiri</a> have a small show this Saturday. There won't be any fire and it should be small but it may be a bit of fun. Here's the information on it: <em>Saturday August 17th</em> <strong>The Arts In Nature Festival</strong> Camp Long - West Seattle 4-7pm <blockquote>
          Come see Cabiri in the wild - mythological forest creatures will be roaming around the pond area at Camp Long, telling stories and creating mischief. At 6:30, join us on a procession to the glacier where we will present 'Changeling' - one of our favorite mythological tales. Members of The Let's Dance! House Band will provide fantastic percussion for the performance.Visit <a href="http://www.naturec.org">www.naturec.org</a> for more information about this FREE festival.
