My good friend, John, who is still over at Microsoft, got himself secretly married to his girlfriend on Saturday. He finally posted a backdated post this evening.

I had called John on Friday and found out that he was going to the East Coast this weekend (where he's from) and then on to Spain for a few weeks. It had seemed kind of odd since he hadn't mentioned it before but, you know, whatever. Now it all makes sense!

Congratulations!
