<p>R and I watched &quot;<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041959/">The Third 
Man</a></b>&quot; this evening. We got this from Netflix. It&#39;s a film noir piece from 
1949 and the cast includes Orson Welles, though not as the main character. I&#39;d 
never seen it and it had always been recommended to me as an old classic. I 
quite enjoyed it and, even if a bit dated in many ways, I thought the film style 
was very well done.</p>
<p>Today was the first day back at work from the holidays. At this point, almost 
everyone is back in the office and things are beginning to proceed apace. 
Normally, almost no one is in the last two weeks of December. Given how much of 
our work involves working with partners on other teams and whatnot, things 
really slow down even for those of us that are working. So, as nice as it is to 
have things slower, I must say that it is good to have people back as well.</p>
