Make people depend on you.
It is not he that adorns but he that adores that makes a divinity. The wise person would rather
see others needing him than thanking him.
To keep them on the threshold of hope is diplomatic, to trust to their
gratitude is boorish; hope has a good memory, gratitude a bad one.
More is to be got from dependence than from courtesy.
He that has satisfied his thirst turns his back on the well,
and the orange once squeezed falls from the golden platter into the waste basket.
When dependence disappears, good behavior goes with it, as well as respect.
Let it be one of the chief lessons of experience to keep hope alive without entirely
satisfying it, by preserving it to make oneself always needed, even by a patron on the throne.
But do not carry silence to excess or you will go wrong,
nor let another&apos;s failing grow incurable for the sake of your own advantage.</center>
