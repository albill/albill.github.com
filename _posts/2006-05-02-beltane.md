<p>A happy Beltane to all. Today is the first of May and it is a traditional holiday for much of Europe traditionally.</p><p>R and I went over to the home of the Sargents, good friends of ours. Denny cooked Thai soup and we all hung out for a while waiting for our friend, Robert, to arrive.</p><p>As it got dark, we all went out to a clearing in their large, forested yard. There, we all performed an invocation to Pan to bring in the May.</p><p style="text-align: center"><img border="1" title="The altar to Pan" alt="The altar to Pan" src="http://static.flickr.com/50/138902614_adb6a06f86.jpg?v=0" /></p><p>We then went inside their yurt (which is used for ritual work) for a little more ritual and relaxing.</p></p> <p style="text-align: center"><img border="1" title="Another altar" alt="Another altar" src="http://static.flickr.com/56/138901966_7ccc0fb3f4.jpg?v=0" /></p><p>After closing the ritual space, R and I came home. Compared to some Beltane rites we have attended, it was rather sedate and small but these are good friends and it was nice to worship with them.</p>
