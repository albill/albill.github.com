Found on a new friend's journal today: <a href="http://www.likeanillusion.com/dakinis.shtml">http://www.likeanillusion.com/dakinis.shtml</a>.

The last few days haven't given me a lot to comment on to other people. I got a new computer at work, a nice one, and spent hours extra over the last two days trying to get it to work. I haven't gotten home before 9:30 either night. It turns out that the computer has some sort of hardware problem that causes it to reboot at will and act otherwise flaky. It's a bit frustrating and it ate up a bunch of my personal time. I went in late today (and will tomorrow) to try to take some of my life back... ;-)
