My first task on the PM day was to take much of a day off and go with my
new org to **[Zoka Coffee](http://www.zokacoffee.com/)**, a local
specialty coffee roasting company. This was part of getting the team to
hang out, raise morale, and get to know people. Many of us on the team
have worked together for years but there are a number of newer faces or
people, like me, who have changed roles. There was a presentation on
coffee production from farming to roast and Zoka's business while we had
much fine coffee. We learned how coffee tasting and quality control
works through a bit of coffee tasting. We did tea tasting as well. Then
there was a presentation on proper espresso making by their barista
trainer who also competes in the barista competitions. We had a bit of
lunch and got to visit the roasting portion of the operation and see how
that works in close detail. All in all, for a coffee lover like myself
(it is just about my only vice), a fun time. Tony, who runs the PM org
(my new boss' boss) put pictures he took up at
