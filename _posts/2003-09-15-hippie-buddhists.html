I'm sitting in the airport in Minneapolis right now. This is where my lay over for the trip home from Conway, MA has left me for a couple of hours. Luckily, the plain came in 30 minutes early so I have even more time to sit in the food court!! ;-) I think I'll write a bit of an account of my trip...

I've spent the last five days at Tsegyalgar in Conway (and I can even spell 'Tsegyalgar' now without looking...) at a Dzogchen Retreat with Namkhai Norbu. Norbu Rinpoche gave a series of teachings on the termas that he's received over the years along with a general teaching and introduction to Dzogchen. There were probably about 80 or so people there at a guess.

Tuesday I flew in to Hartford, CT, got my car at around 5:30 PM after flying all day, and headed north. Somewhere in the middle of MA, I turned left and headed into Conway, which seems to be a town without a center. It kind of follows the road for ten miles off and on. Tsegyalgar owns an old grammar school building and attached hall there and 50+ acres of land about 20 minutes or so further away. I was camping on the land but I needed to go to Tsegyalgar (spelled it again!) to get directions. So, I drove up and it turned out that I arrived right when they were starting their 20th Anniversary party for the center there and were having a banquet. I stayed, drank and ate a bit, met a bunch of people and then gave a ride to a few other visitors out to the land, Khdroling (which I can also spell).

Khandroling is a mosquito infested (and, at this point, I <strong>REALLY</strong> mean infested) chunk of land where a stupa has been put up, Norbu has a retreat cabin and other retreat cabins and structures are being built. It has a pond and it is the site where Norbu received many of his termas. As a plot of land, it's quite nice. It's probably even nicer in the dead of winter when the bugs are dead...

I set up my camp in the dark while attempting to dodge aforementioned insects and blew up my air matress, thus ending my first day at around 12:30 AM or so. I then shivered my way through much of the night until dawn. As it turns out, the second retreat (there was a five day one before I arrived) didn't start until the evening the next day so I hung out with some of my new friends. We drove into a local town, got organic coffee and lunch, hung out quite a bit and generally relaxed. We also investigated the land a bit.

That evening, Rinpoche began teaching. He taught for about two hours a day, each day, over the course of the retreat. Along with his teachings, there was group practice, general instructions by other teachers on various practices, and occasional events, such as on Tibetan Massage or the like. Just before Rinpoche started, JasonÂ and the Evil Ed showed up. I've known the two of them online for the last couple of years on a small e-mail list that Jason runs for some of us Buddhist types who are occultists but I'd never met them in person. Jason and I had been wanting to meet for a while.

Once they showed up and heard about the bugs, a group decision was made that hotels were not only good, but essential. Yes, we wimped out on camping. We found a new hotel about 20 minutes from Tsegyalgar and basically stayed there for the rest of the retreat. This did, in fact, make late night beer runs and drinking a lot less dangerous. After the second day, I got a horrible cold that I'm still working through so I'm doubly glad that we got off of the camping thing.

The three of us hung out for the rest of the retreat, forming a barrier of occultism around ourselves to protect the group from the Hippie vibe, which is always apparent at Buddhist gatherings. For reasons unknown to me, most Buddhists seem to be middle-aged boomers and disproportionately female. The few people my age that are there are often very hippieish or the children of the former, older Buddhists. Now, I actually get along with crunchy types reasonably well but it can get old. The second time I got stuck looking for organic food and supposedly environmentally friendly toothpaste, I got annoyed.

Ed and Jason don't have this problem, both being black hearted and sarcastic magicians as well as kick ass Dzogchen practitioners. I'll be posting pictures later (when I get them from the two of them) but Jason and I are like twins separated at birth. The only thing that saved us is that my hair still has some purple color in it. We literally look close enough in appearance to be brothers. At least two other people commented on it and one almost greeted him as me. We have decided that if we ever form a cult, we will use one pseudonym between us and pretend to be the same person. This will give the appearance of us having mastered bilocation since we're on opposite coasts of North America...

It looks like I need to find my plane now. More later...
