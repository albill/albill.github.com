on [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/), an
[interview](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=367207#367207)
with Dean Hachamovitch and Chris Wilson just went up. The IE team
apparently passed an internal milestone this last Friday in their work
on IE8. Apparently, one of the outgrowths of the work is that IE8 will
pass the [Acid2 Browser Test](http://www.webstandards.org/action/acid2/)
for the first time. Charles, who did the interview, states:

> In this interview, I sit down with IE GM Dean Hachamovitch and
> Architect Chris Wilson to discuss this milestone and dig into
> compliance in general, lessons learned from IE 7 and discuss the IE
> team's ultimate goal of de facto interoperability. Of course, no
> Channel 9 interview is complete without meeting some of the devs who
> write technology so we take a walk from Dean's office to super
> developer Alex Mogilevsky's office to discuss what's been done to
> provide IE with the core rendering features that enable IE 8 to pass
> the ACID 2 test. We also chat with CSS guru Markus Mielke who was
> instrumental in identifying and planning the feature set required to
> pass ACID 2.

The interview is worth listening to for those of us who have wondering
what the hell the IE team has been doing this past year as Mozilla works
towards the Firefox 3 release. Given the recent discussions of the CSS
working group and CSS in general, this seems to be somewhat relevant to
the state of browsing (at least on Windows). I've enclosed links to the
[mp3](http://mschnlnine.vo.llnwd.net/d1/ch9/0/IE8ACID2_ch9.mp3) of the
interview below for playback within this blog entry or you can go to the
[interview
page](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=367207#367207) as
well (where there is also the video). Comments can also be left on the
interview page (if you have a Channel 9 account). ***Warning:*** the
video file is 584 MB in size so you might be better off with the 15 MB
mp3 file. I'm sure that I'll have more thoughts on the interview later
but I wanted to get this out early in the day so those interested in
hearing or watching it could take a look immediately. **Update:** Now
announced on the
[IEBlog](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/12/19/internet-explorer-8-and-acid2-a-milestone.aspx)
as well (with a mention of "IE8 standards mode" being necessary, which
means they have either added a third mode or updated their existing
standards mode, as opposed to "Quirks" mode, rendering for IE8 to be
more compliant with standards. Go figure.)
