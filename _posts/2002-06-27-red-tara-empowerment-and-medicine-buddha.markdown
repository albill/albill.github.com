![image](http://www.zhangzhung.net/lj/red-tara.jpg)I got a reminder
newsletter in my snail mail today that mentioned that [Chagdud Gonpa
Amrita](http://www.cmc.net/~amrita/) is offering the Red Tara
Empowerment on August 8. This local group also gets together on Monday
nights to do the Red Tara Practice together so it would be an
opportunity to take the empowerment and possibly have a group to
practice it with... I'm planning on attending this. I also received the
newsletter for the [Virupa Ecumenical
Institute](http://www.sakya.org/vei/) today. They list the following in
August: **Medicine Buddha: Meditation and Healing Through Sacred Dance
Movement** Prema Dasara and Anahata Iradah Tuesday, August 13, 7:30 PM
$10 Public, $8 Sakya Monastery members $5 Students and Senios *Beginning
and Intermediate Levels* This sacred dance invokes the power of the
Medicine Buddha for developing our wisdom and for healing afflictions of
body and mind. At the request of Lama Lhundrup, Prema Dasara and Anahata
Iradah developed this movement meditation for the nuns of Kopan
Monastery in Nepal. As the basis for the dance, the nuns offered a
four-line prayer they use when making Medicine Buddha Sand Mandalas. The
traditional melody for the mantra resonates deeply and is set in the
context of a simple sadhana practice. Medicine Buddha's mantra purifies
illness and removes obstacles from our spiritual journey. This class is
a powerful inner and outer experience and the actitivities of the
Dharma. For more information on this event and the activities of Prema
and Anahata, please view the website of Tara Dhatu at
