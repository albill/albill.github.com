[Scott](http://blog.djbuddha.org) turned me on to a couple of [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com) blogs today:

* [Dharma Snapshots](http://dharmasnapshots.tumblr.com)
* [Buddha Quotes](http://buddhaquotes.tumblr.com) (from which came the above image)

I thought that I'd share these. I enjoy seeing photographic and artistic work relating to the Dharma but don't often run across interesting expressions of it.
