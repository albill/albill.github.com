I haven't written much lately. I've been kind of tired and when I've had
energy, I've focused it on schoolwork and a number of related things.

Tomorrow, I fly to Oakland. I'll be staying with my in-laws for the
weekend and visiting with friends from the [Open Source Order of the
Golden Dawn](http://www.osogd.org/) and [Pax
Templi](http://www.paxtempli.net/). I'll be back on Sunday afternoon.

I turned in a design for an independent study for next term at school
focusing on current methodologies in studying Western Esotericism and
current research in it. We'll see if it gets approved. If it does, the
work there will put me another step closer to my thesis work for next
Summer/Fall.
