<p>I haven't written much lately. I've been kind of tired and when I've had  energy, I've focused it on schoolwork and a number of related things.</p> <p>Tomorrow, I fly to Oakland. I'll be staying with my in-laws for the weekend  and visiting with friends from the <a href="http://www.osogd.org/">Open Source  Order of the Golden Dawn</a> and <a href="http://www.paxtempli.net/">Pax Templi</a>.  I'll be back on Sunday afternoon.</p> <p>I turned in a design for an independent study for next term at school  focusing on current methodologies in studying Western Esotericism and current  research in it. We'll see if it gets approved. If it does, the work there will  put me another step closer to my thesis work for next Summer/Fall.</p>
