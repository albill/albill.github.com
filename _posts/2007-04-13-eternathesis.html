It's 12:41 AM as I write this. I have just concluded my rewrite of the fourth chapter of my thesis. (I've also managed to make consistent every instance of "Cabala" in the thesis.)

I had meant to work on it for an hour tonight and read a book or something. That was around 9:20 PM or so. Now, while I did digress to check e-mail occasionally, I still did most of three hours work <strong>just to edit a damn chapter!</strong> *sigh*

Now, I will move into the meat of the thesis and focus on the actual ideas concerning the soul.

I need to get this done within the next month if I want to make Summer graduation (assuming my committee is timely). I tend to work better under deadlines so that knowledge isn't a bad thing necessarily.

It's just become a little numbing to work all day at my tech job, which isn't exactly a sleepwalk, and come home, do my Buddhist practices, eat something, at least spend a little time with the missus and work on this thesis. I have been taking free days (or free late nights) where I've been reading some fiction instead of the thesis but that's because I just can't do this every day without my mind going numb from looking at the material.

This week's distraction was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/No-Dominion-Novel-Charlie-Huston/dp/0345478258/"><strong>No Dominion</strong></a> by Charlie Huston. Who can't love noir vampires on the streets of New York. None of that Buffy cute shit here. There isn't a "nice guy" to be found in the entire book. I certainly wouldn't want the protagonist mad at me, vampire or not.
