This has been making the rounds with a few people but is still worth noting, I think. Patrick has put a guide up for basic zazen practice that is fairly good as well as entertaining.

I happen to be familiar with Patrick because he does a podcast with <a href="http://www.gwenbell.com/">Gwen Bell</a> from <a href="http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/">BuddhistGeeks</a> called "<a href="http://www.gcast.com/u/zenisstupid">Zen is Stupid</a>." This is an occasionally inane but often entertaining podcast on Zen and Buddhism in general.
