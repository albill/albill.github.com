This has been making the rounds with a few people but is still worth
noting, I think. Patrick has put a guide up for basic zazen practice
that is fairly good as well as entertaining.
I happen to be familiar with Patrick because he does a podcast with
[Gwen Bell](http://www.gwenbell.com/) from
[BuddhistGeeks](http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/) called "[Zen is
Stupid](http://www.gcast.com/u/zenisstupid)." This is an occasionally
inane but often entertaining podcast on Zen and Buddhism in general.
