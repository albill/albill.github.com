Found on Boing Boing&apos;s weblog:

<b>Sir Mix-A-Lot&apos;s "Baby&apos;s Got Back" in Latin.</b> 

magnae clunes mihi placent, nec possum de hac re mentiri.
quis enim, consortes mei, non fateatur,
cum puella incedit minore medio corpore
sub quo manifestus globus, inflammare animos

<lj-cut text="translation..."><i>Large buttocks are pleasing to me, nor am I able to lie concerning this matter.
For who, colleagues, would not admit,
Whenever a girl comes by with a rather small middle part of the body
Beneath which is an obvious spherical mass, that it inflames the spirits)</i>
