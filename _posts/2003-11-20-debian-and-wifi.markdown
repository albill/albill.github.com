So I have a Knoppix-based Linux install on a slim 600mhz laptop that I have (for shits and giggles). Card services are installed, as are wireless services. When I hook my wi-fi card in and boot linux, it properly detects that I have an orinoco 802.11b card <em><strong>but...</strong></em> I can't get it configured. The card is initially powered when I put but I think that is just the system checking pcmcia cards. I can't figure out how to configure the fucker to use my network at home. (Let's leave aside how the hell I set my WEP key for now). Any experts on debian-based configurations out there? Any nice KDE-based front ends for this shit?
