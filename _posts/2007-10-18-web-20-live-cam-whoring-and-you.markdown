[Asa Dotzler](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/) has gotten into this
via [Justin.tv](http://www.justin.tv/). You can watch our beloved Asa
picking his nose while working on his latest blog post through [his site
on Justin.tv](http://www.justin.tv/asadotzler). Asa mentioned this
briefly on his blog on October 5 but he's been really getting into it at
work lately with three different webcams in his office pointing in
different directions. Seriously, there seems to be a lot of interest in
being able to stream live webcam video lately even though it has been
around as a basic technology forever. Along with existing Justin.tv, I
came across [Operator11](http://operator11.com/about) this evening for
the first time. This is a site that hosts live webcam feeds, allowing
you to schedule time, do chat, etc. I noticed it initially because I
went to visit the [Treeleaf Zendo
blog](http://treeleafzen.blogspot.com/). This is a Soto Zen teacher's
blog that was announced on the [Dogen Sangha
blog](http://gudoblog-e.blogspot.com/) this evening. I know that Jiun
Sensei at [Daiun-Ji](http://www.daiun-ji.org/) has been looking at the
possibility of doing various Buddhist teachings online. Treeleaf Zendo
is the first regular attempt that I've seen at this. I'm not sure how
good (or bad) the content of it is there, having barely watched one bit,
but it is interesting to see people attempting to do something
worthwhile with this kind of technology at a grassroots level.
