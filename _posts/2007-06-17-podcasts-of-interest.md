I listen to quite a few podcasts while walking or driving in the car (I have a connector for my iPod in the car).

I wanted to give people a list of some of my favorite podcasts.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/">Buddhist Geeks</a> (<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/BuddhistGeeksPodcast">feed</a>) -  This is a fairly recent podcast done by a trio of, well, Buddhist Geeks. They interview a variety of Buddhist teachers and are probably pretty closely aligned to a lot of my thought on Buddhism.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.anders.com/lectures/lars_brownworth/12_byzantine_rulers/">12 Byzantine Rulers</a> (<a href="http://www.anders.com/lectures/lars_brownworth/12_byzantine_rulers/rss.xml">feed</a>) - A phenomenal podcast on the history of the misnamed Byzantine Empire through 12 of its emperors. This is a fun podcast to listen to if you have any interest in history.</li>
	<li><a href="http://uroboros.wordpress.com/">alchemically braindamaged</a> (<a href="http://zacharius.libsyn.com/rss">feed</a>) - Zac's podcast on magic and spirituality. He's a Buddhist practitioner with a background in Western occult practices so a lot of what he says makes pretty solid sense to me. I don't agree with some of what he goes on about but it is an exceptionally interesting podcast. This has probably been, over time, my favorite podcast.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/">Dan Carlin's Hardcore History</a> (<a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/dchh.xml">feed</a>) - This is an excellent podcast on history. I've been enjoying this a massive amount recently. Dan also has a podcast called "<a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/cswdc.xml">Common Sense</a>", which I just subscribed to as well. I haven't listened to much of it yet though.</li>
	<li><a href="http://daiun-ji.org/path">Path of the Ekayana</a> (<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/daiun-ji/thzP">feed</a>) - This is Rev. Jiun Foster's podcast. He's is the abbot of Daiun-Ji Great Cloud Temple, which is the organization that I am "attached" to and he's my primary Buddhist teacher. He's also all that <strong><em>and</em></strong> a bag of chips. The podcast is mostly audio from teachings given during group practice on Sundays and a few classes.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.unfetteredmind.com/audio/">Unfettered Mind</a> (<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=106320028">iTunes only feed</a>) - This is <a href="http://www.unfetteredmind.org/um/ken.php">Ken McLeod</a>'s audio of Buddhist retreats and classes that he teaches. Ken is a Vajrayana teacher in Los Angeles and I've gotten a lot of his Buddhist material. He recently started up "<a href="http://www.unfetteredmind.com/audio/podquest.php">Unfettered Questions</a>" as a Q&amp;A audio podcast as well.</li>
	<li><a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow's Craphound.com</a> (<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/doctorow_podcast">feed</a>) - Cory Doctorow is a well known science fiction writer (he won a Locus award yesterday for the third year in a row). He's also a technology and privacy pundit who used to be an evangelist for the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>. He uploads talks by him (including one that I recorded!) and readings of his stories.</li>
</ul>
Please check these out. If you have any suggestions of podcasts for me, please feel free to leave me comments or e-mail me as well.
