As some are aware from previous postings, I'm starting a podcast series,
**Ex Templo**, over at [extemplo.org](http://www.extemplo.org/). I'm
planning on recording the first interview for it with [Right Rev. James
Jiun Foster](http://www.daiun-ji.org/About/teachers.php) from [Daiun-Ji
Great Cloud Temple](http://www.daiun-ji.org) in Cincinnati, Ohio this
weekend. Rev. Foster has a podcast of his own, [Path of the
Ekayana](http://www.daiun-ji.org/path/index.php), which he has been
doing for over a year and a half now. In this podcast, he records
teachings from gatherings of Daiun-Ji Great Cloud Temple and classes
that he runs for it. As the especially studious may note, Rev. Foster is
also my own teacher so I am starting the series with a certain amount of
bias but I prefer to think of it as starting with the most immediately
willing victim. He was the second person to agree to do an interview
with me and he moves around a lot less than the other, Thorn Coyle, a
local witch, teacher, and author who travels extensively for teaching.
I'm going to out to Ohio this weekend for a training workshop for mikkyo
with Rev. Foster and others so the timing worked out well. Assuming the
interview doesn't head off into dorkland and TSA doesn't confiscate my
recording device, I expect that I'll have material up next week at some
point. I don't have much (hmm...*any*) interviewing experience so this
may go badly. We'll have to see... If anyone has any suggestions for a
teacher of Buddhism in America in the 21st century, feel free to send
them my way. The podcast focuses on spirituality and spiritual leader or
practitioners and how their spirituality works in today's world for both
themselves and others. ***Postscript**: If anyone can recognize the
voice at the beginning and end of Rev. Foster's podcasts, they get a
gold star.*
