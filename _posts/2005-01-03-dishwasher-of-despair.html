I shut off the water for the house and the power to that part of the kitchen and he got the rusted open valve under the sink shut. After a bit of work and some cutting of floor vinyl, we got the dishwasher pulled out. The motor had been the culprit, leaking onto the floor and probably for a couple of years (since before we bought the house). It also turns out that the back wall behind the dishwasher is uninsulated. Possibly the entire wall behind the countertops, which is an exterior wall...

It fill the whole bay for the dishwasher and a bit on all sides.

The downside of this is that the water probably leaked under the cabinet next to it, which is all one piece, so I probably have some rotten plywood under my sink's cabinet. This won't get any worse but can't be fixed without pulling out the entire countertop and cabinet on that side of the kitchen. The uninsulated wall stays that way.<br /> <b>Total Cost</b>: Probably a day's work plus some materials.

I've got a lead from my friend Denny on the guy who remodeled the inside of his house. If I do the quick fix, I might use another reference that I've gotten. I doubt if I'm going to pay something like $12K to remodel my kitchen this winter though. I'd have to take a loan out in order to do it.<b> </b>
