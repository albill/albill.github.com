Anarchism: The political theory that aims to create a society absent of
all forms of authority, particularly those involving domination and
exploitation. Transhumanism: The cultural movement that affirms the
desirability of fundamentally altering the human condition through
applied science and technology. Anarcho-Transhumanism stands for:

-   Political Freedom: Against the tyranny of government.
-   Economic Freedom: Against the tyranny of capitalism.
-   Biological Freedom: Against the tyranny of genes.

Anarcho-Transhumanism is not: Libertarian: It does not believe in
free-market fantasies. Extropian: It does not believe in optimistic
futurism.
