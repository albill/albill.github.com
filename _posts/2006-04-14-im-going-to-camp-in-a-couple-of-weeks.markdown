Seattle Mind Camp 1.0 was an event that happened last fall in Seattle. It's a  24 hour geekfest with people. I found out about it at the last minute and wasn't  able to go because it was sold out and I had a school conflict.

Well, <a href="http://seattlemind.com/">Seattle Mind Camp 2.0</a> is  happening at the end of the month and I just signed up to attend.

Here is the description from the site:
<blockquote>Seattle Mind Camp is a self-organizing, digitally minded,  	entrepreneur-driven, overnight Seattle confab.
<ul>
	<li><strong>What:</strong> A weekend, 24-hour, multi-track event. Think huge space  		with breakout rooms, broadband Wi-Fi, projectors, white boards - and  		you.</li>
	<li><strong>Who:</strong> 200 of Seattle's forward thinkers: techies,  		entrepreneurs, executives, gamers, artists, and anyone else with a great  		idea.</li>
	<li><strong>When:</strong> Mind Camp will take place on April 29-30, 2006</li>
	<li><strong>Why:</strong> Why not?</li>
</ul>
What happens when you put 200 of Seattle's smartest geeks in a creative  	environment for 24 hours? We're not sure either, but we'd like to find out.  	It's time to meet and connect with those involved in the interesting  	projects going on in Seattle in a relaxed environment. Come, camp out,  	create.

<strong>How can I attend?</strong>
So you want to be there? Cool. We just have a few things you should know:
<ol>
	<li>All attendees are expected to participate in some fashion, so come  		ready to share the things you have been working on or that get you  		excited.</li>
	<li>Mind Camp is an NDA-free zone. If you can’t talk about it, don’t  		bring it up. Likewise, if you want something kept secret, just let those  		around you know.</li>
	<li>If you are cool with the above and want to secure your spot, send an  		email to register@seattlemind.com letting us know you want to be there.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Can I bring anything?</strong>
Sure. Being that Mind Camp is an overnight event, you should wear (or bring)  	comfortable clothing, a sleeping bag, and some snacks. We will take care of  	breakfast, lunch, and dinner – the rest of the time, you are at the mercy of  	your cooler. One thing – this is an alcohol-free event.

We may throw out a few requests for other items as the event draws near, but  	for now, don’t worry about it.</blockquote>
A brief, pseudo-documentary from 1.0 is available at <a href="http://students.washington.edu/natetrue/mindcamp/"> http://students.washington.edu/natetrue/mindcamp/</a>.

Here is a list of session ideas for the <a href="http://www.seattlemind.com/wiki/index.php/MC2_Session_Ideas">2.0 camp</a>  and one from the previous <a href="http://www.seattlemind.com/wiki/index.php/Session_Ideas">1.0 camp</a>.  Some kick ass shit here.

The Seattle Post-Intelligencer has an article about the 1.0 camp at <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/246392_geeks29.html">http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/246392_geeks29.html</a>. The Seattle Times' article is <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002594398_btinterface31.html">here</a>.
Things like this are why I like working in tech. My grandfather was an  engineer and I am the only other propeller head in the family.

R called me a "nerd" when I told her that I wanted to attend. It looks like  fun and open ended though.
