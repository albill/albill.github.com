<blockquote>"If we listened to our intellect, we&apos;d never have a love affair. We&apos;d never have a friendship. We&apos;d never go into business, because we&apos;d be cynical. Well, that&apos;s nonsense. You&apos;ve got to jump off cliffs all the time and build your wings on the way down."</blockquote> - Ray Bradbury
