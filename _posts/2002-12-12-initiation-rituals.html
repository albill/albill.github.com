I've done plenty of initiation ceremonies (non-OTO) both on book and off book. The best ones, in my opinion, occured when everyone who was an officer had been in that roll for a while and knew it and didn't need a piece of paper. Reading from paper only worked when candidates couldn't see the people anyway so they couldn't see the paper... Delivery is better even so if there is no paper.This happens the most in masonic style initiations where there is a set script. Other forms of initiation follow formulas and have a structure but don't have words and such that are set in stone. This happens in the Ogdoadic tradition and you see this in non-Western magic. As long as certain actions with appropriate visualizations and energy work occur between the intiator and initiate, it doesn't matter what is said. This makes reading from a script less of a concern but still definitely something to be avoided.

Personally, I think that initiation rites should contain a balance between the two. Certain ritual actions <strong>plus</strong> associated verbiage or motions by officers should occur but they should be fluid enough that the rituals are not entirely identical as long as the formula of the rite and its underlying working are intact.

I've begun to truly despise going to initiation ceremonies and watching someone read haltingly and in an almost monotone from a script or fail to make eye contact along with dramatic delivery because they are too busy staring at the script in their hands. It seems that if people want the responsibility to initiate, they should, at least over time, learn the particulars well enough to only need a script onhand for an occasional memory lapse.

Your mileage may vary, of course. ;-)
