<P>From Gamegrene.com for the world of Ghyll:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Welcome to the world of Ghyll. The basic idea is that each player takes on the role of a scholar, from before scholarly pursuits became professionalized (or possibly after they ceased to be). You are cranky, opinionated, prejudiced, and eccentric. You are also collaborating with a number of your peers -- the other players -- on the construction of an encyclopedia about Ghyll. Despite the fact that your peers are self-important, narrow-minded dunderheads, they are honest scholars. No matter how strained their interpretations are, their facts are accurate as historical research can make them. So if you cite an entry, you have to treat its factual content as true! (Though you can argue vociferously with the interpretation and introduce new facts that shade the interpretation.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The entry on AuroAnthropology:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>AuroAnthropology</H2>
<P><B>AuroAnthropology</B> is the social-humanist study of the history of light and light sources in culture, in contrast to the long theological tradition of the <A title="Brothers of the Lantern" href="http://gamegrene.com/wiki/Brothers_of_the_Lantern">Brothers of the Lantern</A>. Modern AuroAnthropology is a fairly young science, as clear and objective study into light and related matters was until relatively recently the subject of strong taboo, if not outright persecution. Consider the obscure approach which a scribe of the Fylesgate Annals seems to think necessary in referring to the invention of <A title="Andelphracian Lights" href="http://gamegrene.com/wiki/Andelphracian_Lights">Andelphracian Lights</A>: (Please forgive the translation from ternary script) </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Hail Andelphracia! Hail!<BR>Seventh mayor, seven times chosen,<BR>Ripped a secret from heaven<BR>Any other would surely be smote to ash<BR>Or struck by lightning as an unrighteous thief<BR>Also, she commissioned a rather-charming clock tower<BR>Presided over festivals seven times<BR>Resolved the farm dispute fairly to either side<BR>Until you build a clock<BR>Be wary in following the example of your betters.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Even in our contemporary times, the pursuit of AuroAnthropology has been at best considered fairly controversial. Consider this recent clipping from our own <A title="Folktown Records" href="http://gamegrene.com/wiki/Folktown_Records">Folktown Records</A>, edition 312: </P>

<P>"Why does the Sun Shine?" - Gibbous Saunders, age 11.</P>
<P>Garth Haversham (Managing Editor) replies: "Dear readers, while it is the policy and mission of this publication to provide clear answers to questions, in this case myself and my staff have had to make a tough call--Master Saunders, ask your mother."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In very recent years, however, thanks to the pioneering work of many scholars toiling in obscurity, a few courageous city 'docs', and the higher profile activities of the <A title=Unquisition href="http://gamegrene.com/wiki/Unquisition">Unquisition</A>, many questions about the history of portable and celestial light have begun to be addressed. </P>
