Following our visit with the Mythbusters and the Exploratorium, R and I
took a stroll around the [Palace of Fine
Arts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_Of_Fine_Arts). I'd never been
there before though I had heard about it many times over the years. I
have a thing for architecture, especially in a Classical or
pseudo-Classical style so I took a lot of photos. I've put them up in a
set on [my flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/). Here
are a couple from the
[set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157594176296890/):
