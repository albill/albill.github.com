Before a couple of months ago, I did not have much awareness of
[TED](http://www.ted.com) or the TED Talks. TED defines itself and the
talks site with:

> "TED stands for Technology, Entertainment, Design. It started out (in
> 1984) as a conference bringing together people from those three
> worlds. Since then its scope has become ever broader. The annual
> conference now brings together the world's most fascinating thinkers
> and doers, who are challenged to give the talk of their lives (in 18
> minutes). This site makes the best talks and performances from TED
> available to the public, for free. More than 100 talks from our
> archive are now available, with more added each week. These videos are
> released under a Creative Commons license, so they can be freely
> shared and reposted. Our mission: Spreading ideas."

There are some excellent talks on this site. Here are a few examples:

-   [Rick Warren: Living a Life with a
    Purpose](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/71)
-   [Sir Ken Robinson: Do schools kill
    creativity?](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/66)
-   [James Howard Kunstler on
    suburbia](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/121)
-   [Jane Goodall on what separates us from the
    apes](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/11)
-   [Dan Dennett on our
    consciousness](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/102)
-   [Seth Godin on sliced
    bread](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/28)

I encourage those so inclined to go check it out. There is some neat
stuff on the site.
