So, R and I trooped down to Scarecrow Video last night and rented "<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0264508">Dagon</a>" on DVD. Woo hoo. Lovecraft!!

We thought we had this on a borrowed tape from a friend of R's but it turned out to be D<strong>r</strong>agon, the Bruce Lee Story instead (the tape label was off...). It was amusing to think about "Dagon: The Bruce Lee Story." Martial arts meets the Unspeakable Horror...

It was actually better than the low-end B Movie material that I was expecting though I suspect that I liked it more than R. ;-)

I've had a soft spot in my heat for H.P. Lovecraft ever since I read "<a href="http://www.gizmology.net/lovecraft/works/mountains.htm">At the Mountains of Madness</a>" when I was nine years old. My mother was an H.P. Lovecraft fan so I read most of his stuff before I was ten... I'm told that this may explain a few things about me.
