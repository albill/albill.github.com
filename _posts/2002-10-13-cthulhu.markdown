So, R and I trooped down to Scarecrow Video last night and rented
"[Dagon](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0264508)" on DVD. Woo hoo. Lovecraft!!
We thought we had this on a borrowed tape from a friend of R's but it
turned out to be D**r**agon, the Bruce Lee Story instead (the tape label
was off...). It was amusing to think about "Dagon: The Bruce Lee Story."
Martial arts meets the Unspeakable Horror... It was actually better than
the low-end B Movie material that I was expecting though I suspect that
I liked it more than R. ;-) I've had a soft spot in my heat for H.P.
Lovecraft ever since I read "[At the Mountains of
Madness](http://www.gizmology.net/lovecraft/works/mountains.htm)" when I
was nine years old. My mother was an H.P. Lovecraft fan so I read most
of his stuff before I was ten... I'm told that this may explain a few
things about me.
