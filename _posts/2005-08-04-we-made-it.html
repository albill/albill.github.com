<P>After&nbsp;a three hour plane flight, we have made it to San Diego.</P>
<P>We're at the <A href="http://www.parkmanorsuites.com/home.html">Park Manor Suites</A> near the zoo. We have a very nice suite here in the 1920s hotel. It even has free wifi!</P>
<P>We had a nice dinner at <STRONG>Jimmy Carter's </STRONG>across the street and did a bit of a walk near the park.</P>
<P>Tomorrow is the pre-wedding lunch with my inlaws and extended family. Saturday evening is the wedding.</P>
<P>I have my ipod, a laptop and free wifi. I also have a wonderful book on approaching a theology for polytheism and some novels. I will survive.</P>
