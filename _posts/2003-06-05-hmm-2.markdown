Does it seem odd to anyone else that my main enthusiasms are:

-   Hermetic Magic
-   Neoplatonism, its cultural antecedents and praxis
-   Tibetan Buddhism and Tantra

?? I like the thoughts that inominandum has shared about using tantric
magical techniques in other praxis but I need to immerse myself enough
in those in the first place in order to gain the insight to enable me to
do this... That's going to take a while, which is fine.
