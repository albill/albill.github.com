Does it seem odd to anyone else that my main enthusiasms are:<ul><li>Hermetic Magic</li><li>Neoplatonism, its cultural antecedents and praxis</li><li>Tibetan Buddhism and Tantra</li></ul>??

I like the thoughts that inominandum has shared about using tantric magical techniques in other praxis but I need to immerse myself enough in those in the first place in order to gain the insight to enable me to do this... That&apos;s going to take a while, which is fine.
