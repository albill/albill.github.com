<strong>Anyone know of any decent Tibetan Buddhist e-mail lists that are worth the trouble?</strong>

So, I was doing a seatch on "Shitro Empowerment" to get more information and I found <a href="http://kilung.org/schedule/schedule.htm">this schedule page</a> which mentions:
<blockquote><strong>Meditation And Practice</strong>1617 Summit Ave. & Pine #13, Seattle
Every other Tuesday, 7:30-9:30 pm, $10 donation

Jan 9 · Jan 23 · Feb 13 (Lung) · Feb 27 · March 13 · March 27 · May 8 · May 22

Over the five-month period, Rinpoche plans to cover

Basic sitting meditation
Tonglen
Mind Training
Brief practices of Chenrezig, Vajrasattva, 21 Taras, and Medicine Buddha will also be conducted each of these evenings. A reading transmission will be given on the evening of Feb. 13.</blockquote>
The thing is, this is probably all of 12 blocks from where I live. <strong>Damn it!</strong> Why did I find this right when it is getting over? I had no idea that this class was going on or I'd be taking it.

It seems that there was a Shitro Empowerment on Saturday too... I think I'll be going to this though:
<blockquote><strong>Nyingma Protectors</strong>Seattle 1st Baptist Church, Harvard & Seneca

The protectors are an integral part of many practices, but rarely taught about. This talk is intended for students of the Nyingma lineage. Translated. 7:30 pm. $10 donation
Wednesday, June 6</blockquote>
