Here is the photo of myself, Sensei Foster, and my newly named Dharma sister, Emiko. This was taken following the Jukai ceremony on Saturday and the presentation of our rakusus with our new names and the precepts (we're wearing those). <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/213803948/"><img width="500" height="375" alt="Jukai 1" src="http://static.flickr.com/98/213803948_4cfe786182.jpg" /></a>
