Richard Kadrey, who has written some good stories in the past, has
released the full text of his new urban fantasy novel in a nice PDF. I'm
not sure of the backstory on why it was not published but why look a
gift horse in the mouth. He says in his letter:

> Dear Everyone,
>
> Back around 9/11, when I saw such disparate fantasies as
> **Hellblazer** and **Preacher**, **American Gods** and **Carrie**,
> **Buffy the Vampire Slayer** and **Donnie Darko** living together in
> happy harmony in friends' homes, I thought it would be a swell idea to
> write a little fantasy novel in a modern American prose style.
>
> Damn, was I wrong.
>
> A series of misadventures, misunderstandings and missteps later, I
> have an orphan book on my hands. Rather than let the gnarled little
> thing sulk in the corner, getting fat on pilfered cat food and dust
> bunnies, I've decided to send it out into the world to seek its own
> good times or oblivion. Toward that end, I'm putting the entire text
> of the novel online as a free, downloadable PDF. It's in a lovely
> package designed by type-god [John D.
> Berry](http://www.creativepro.com/author/home/951.html).
>
> The book is titled **Blind Shrike**. It's not a rotten book, I think.
> In fact, it's a pretty traditional fantasy quest, just one that, to
> me, makes sense in George W. Bush's America. The hero of the story is
> on a quest for his own lost ignorance and innocence. He really doesn't
> want to know too much because, as many of us have learned, too much
> information is a soul-sucking pain in the ass. In the book you'll also
> find magic and monsters, angels and demons, magical swords and
> forbidden books. And blimps. Every fantasy novel should have at least
> one blimp.
>
> So, with a last blurt of carnival barking, I now give you **Blind
> Shrike**. You might like it or you might hate it. I hope that you
> download it and enjoy it. But if you don't, tough. It's free. Don't
> write me any stupid emails. Instead, go write your own damned book.
>
> Love & kisses,
>
> Richard Kadrey
