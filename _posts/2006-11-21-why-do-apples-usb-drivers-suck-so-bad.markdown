Without fail, several times a week, I have to unplug and replug in USB
devices to my Macbook. This is because OS X suddenly can't speak to them
anymore or they start acting odd. These are devices directly connected
or through a hub. The special examples of this are my trackball, which
loses the ability to use it's right clicking and the specific file that,
when copied to an external hard drive, causes the copy process to stop
and lock. You can't shut it down or eject the drive. You have to
physically unplug the drive and hope it doesn't fry the file system on
it. It's good that Apple has such an excellent fucking QA department.
*This rant was inspired by my repeated attempts to copy over my music
files to an external hard drive tonight only to watch it fail as it
chokes on various files that my Windows box handles fine... The solution
is to zip the files, copy the zip file to the drive via USB, and then
unzip. Thanks, Steve.*
