Woot. Back from both my Ancient Greek class and my tattooing session. I'm getting my teeth cleaned for the first time in a couple of years on Thursdays.

Is this purgatory?

Anyway, total time in ass-numbing tattoo chair: 4.25 hours plus breaks. Yes, this is my first tattoo and it took over four hours straight to do. My tattoo artist (Tina Bafaro, wonderful lady and artist!) says that I sat well, especially since it was my first time. I must say that it hurt like a motherfucker to do though. Not the kind of hurt where you go "Fuck this, I'm out of here, you prick!" but the kind where you go "If this hurt just a <em>little bit</em> more, I wouldn't be able to handle this." Tina said that it gets better after a short while and it did get a bit better for a while but it would come and go. After about three hours or so, I could tell that my body was getting fatigued. It was getting harder to just sit and let her work.

It's hard to have witty conversation when someone rubbing your arm with some bastard offspring of a buzsaw and a belt sander that leaves ink behind. We spoke a bit but after a while it got to be "How you doing?" "Fine." "Cool."

It's done though. We finished the whole thing unless it gets screwed up by the healing or me scratching it or something.

It did make Greek seem lightweight though! ;-)
