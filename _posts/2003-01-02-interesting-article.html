Wow. This is a really cool article. I want to read this fellow&apos;s book. <b>What Should I Do With My Life? The real meaning of success -- and how to find it</b> <i>by Po Bronson</i> <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/online/66/mylife.html">http://www.fastcompany.com/online/66/mylife.html</a> A quote:<blockquote>
          <i>This is not a new idea. But it may be the most powerfully pressing one ever to be disrespected by the corporate world. There are far too many smart, educated, talented people operating at quarter speed, unsure of their place in the world, contributing far too little to the productive engine of modern civilization. There are far too many people who look like they have their act together but have yet to make an impact. You know who you are. It comes down to a simple gut check: You either love what you do or you don&apos;t. Period.</i>
        </blockquote>and
        
        <blockquote>
          <i>And this is where the second big insight came in: Your calling isn&apos;t something you inherently "know," some kind of destiny. Far from it. Almost all of the people I interviewed found their calling after great difﬁculty. They had made mistakes before getting it right. For instance, the catﬁsh farmer used to be an investment banker, the truck driver had been an entertainment lawyer, a chef had been an academic, and the police ofﬁcer was a Harvard MBA. Everyone discovered latent talents that weren&apos;t in their skill sets at age 25.</i>
