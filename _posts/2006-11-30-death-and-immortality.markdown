R and I went and saw [**The
Fountain**](http://thefountainmovie.warnerbros.com/) after work today.
This is Darren Aronofsky's new film. I had at least one coworker tell me
that he wanted to hear what I thought of it when I told him this
afternoon that I was going to see it. I'm not sure what to say to him
though. It is a beautiful movie, visually and otherwise. Very few movies
actually affect me on an emotional level and most of those are the ones
that make me feel anger at the injustices of the world, not a sense of
both loss and beauty. The Fountain is far from a perfect movie and is,
in fact, very limited in a way. While it is so lush visually, on the
level of story, it is quite simple and sparse. I found that I
appreciated and enjoyed the circles that the store made in time, logic,
and symbolism. The literalist in my younger self would not have
appreciated it but I did. It is easy to empathize with the drives of the
main character and the sense of duty and impending loss as he watches
what he loves go to a fate that he may not be able to avert. I found
myself thinking in Buddhist terms of both his clutching and his fears,
especially when contrasted with what his love was expressing (both his
love in emotional terms and his love in the person of his other...). It
is definitely worth seeing on the big screen for both immediacy and the
visual impact.
