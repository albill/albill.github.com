I posted the other day about visiting [Buddha
Dendo](http://www.buddhadendo.org) in the mountains in northern
California. On the site there is a new building, a goma-do. This is for
the performance of the fire ritual, the goma, that is part of esoteric
Buddhism in Japan. You will find it in both Shingon and Tendai Buddhism
and also within the Shugendo practices that have connections to both
Shingon and Tendai. Most people outside of Japan are not familiar with
the Japanese goma ritual. I know of a few people that have witnessed it
here in the United States that are not practitioners but most people who
see it have to go to a Shingon or Tendai temple (a rare thing here) in
order to witness it. (Though I am aware of one instance of a Japanese
priest performing the goma at Burning Man as witnessed by a Buddhist
friend of mine.) The goma is ultimately derived from the Vedic homa fire
ritual. As many people are aware, but commonly don't reflect on,
Buddhism was originally an Indian religion that developed from the
matrix of religious cults (in the proper sense) and philosophies present
in India at the time of the Buddha. The Buddha's teachings were a sharp
break with earlier traditions but its practices and the philosophical
framework in which it worked were not created from nothing and were
influenced by the cultural matrix. While controversial to say for some
who hold to a kind of fundamentalism, it is also likely that later
Tantric Buddhism was heavily influenced by the non-Buddhist Tantra
present in India in later centuries. Traditional or later
non-traditional elements of Indian religion were often reinterpreted,
especially on an inner level, from a Buddhist point of view. You can
also see a version of the fire ritual within Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism
as well. (I found [an
abstract](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-0279(200010/12)120:4%3C594:IFRIIA%3E2.0.CO;2-3)
of what looks to be an interesting article comparing Tibetan and Indian
fire rituals.) As Dr. Richard Payne notes in his book, "[The Tantric
ritual of Japan: feeding the gods, the Shingon fire
ritual](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/27428833)":

> It is well recognized that there is a historical continuity between
> the goma of present day Japanese Tantric Buddhism and the fire
> sacrifices known to predate even the earliest Vedas. Elements of the
> Vedic rituals have been found to be identical with the elements of the
> Goma.

Later, Dr. Payne goes on to write:

> One of the characteristics of Tantric Buddhist goma is the importance
> placed on the inner goma. The inner goma is a visualization which
> emphasizes the unity of the deity, the fire and the practitioners (the
> mouth of the deity, the mouth of the altar hearth and the
> practitioner's own mouth are visualized as one), and the unity of the
> three mysteries of body, speech and mind.

You can see a very brief example of a Hindu fire ritual on
[Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHLf46oG2tE) below: You can
compare it with the very brief bit shown of a Shingon goma ritual
[here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fbPZUxA7sA) as well: (*People
tend not to film these as they are fairly private but the above seems to
come officially from a temple on Koyasan.*) The goma ritual is much
longer (around 45 minutes or so oftentimes) so this is really just a
brief snippet. Unfortunately, you don't see the pouring of the oils in
the Japanese ritual clip as you do in the Hindu one but it is present if
you witness the ritual. In Japan, there are public performances at
various times a year with large crowds. I did find one example of this
on [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUfXxdV1tgk) as well: This
all seemed worth saying something about since it is far outside the
experience of most people outside of Indian and Japanese culture (or
Tibetan, for that matter).
