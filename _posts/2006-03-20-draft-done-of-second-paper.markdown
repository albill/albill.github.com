Wow...I just finished my draft of "The Rise of Mainstream Western  Esotericism: Nineteenth Century Esoteric Currents and Societies." This is my  second paper for my independent study in Western Esotericism.

Total length: 18 pages (double-spaced).
Total word count: 5, 811.

Well, I managed to cover the topic from German Theosophy (Boehme and then  Swedenborg) through Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry and wind up in the  Theosophical Society and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn...

I started this Friday evening and worked on it off and on this weekend. I'm  beat.
