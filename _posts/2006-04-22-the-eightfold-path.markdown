It is another day for Buddhist posts. This is long so feel free not to
read it if you care little for such things. The Buddha taught an
Eightfold Path as the way to achieve enlightenment and end suffering.
The following was written by someone else (I'm not sure who) but I'll
quote it here because it does a good job at covering things. I've
reorganized it lightly in places. **The Noble Eightfold Path** It
consists of:

1.  Right View
2.  Right Intention
3.  Right Speech
4.  Right Action
5.  Right Livelihood
6.  Right Effort
7.  Right Mindfulness
8.  Right Concentration

The Noble Eightfold Path describes the way to the end of suffering, as
it was laid out by Siddhartha Gautama. It is a practical guideline to
ethical and mental development with the goal of freeing the individual
from attachments and delusions; and it finally leads to understanding
the truth about all things. Together with the Four Noble Truths it
constitutes the gist of Buddhism. Great emphasis is put on the practical
aspect, because it is only through practice that one can attain a higher
level of existence and finally reach enlightenment. The eight aspects of
the path are not to be understood as a sequence of single steps, instead
they are highly interdependent principles that have to be seen in
relationship with each other. **1. Right View** Right view is the
beginning and the end of the path, it simply means to see and to
understand things as they really are and to realize the Four Noble
Truths. As such, right view is the cognitive aspect of wisdom. It means
to see things through, to grasp the impermanent and imperfect nature of
worldly objects and ideas, and to understand the law of karma and karmic
conditioning. Right view is not necessarily an intellectual capacity,
just as wisdom is not just a matter of intelligence. Instead, right view
is attained, sustained, and enhanced through all capacities of mind. It
begins with the intuitive insight that all beings are subject to
suffering and it ends with complete understanding of the true nature of
all things. Since our view of the world forms our thoughts and our
actions, right view yields right thoughts and right actions. **2. Right
Intention** While right view refers to the cognitive aspect of wisdom,
right intention refers to the volitional aspect, i.e. the kind of mental
energy that controls our actions. Right intention can be described best
as *commitment* to ethical and mental self-improvement. Buddha
distinguishes three types of right intentions:

1.  the intention of renunciation, which means resistance to the pull of
    desire.
2.  the intention of good will, meaning resistance to feelings of anger
    and aversion.
3.  the intention of harmlessness, meaning not to think or act cruelly,
    violently, or aggressively, and to develop compassion.

**3. Right Speech** Right speech is the first principle of ethical
conduct in the eightfold path. Ethical conduct is viewed as a guideline
to *moral discipline*, which supports the other principles of the path.
This aspect is not self-sufficient, however, essential, because mental
purification can only be achieved through the cultivation of ethical
conduct. The importance of speech in the context of Buddhist ethics is
obvious: words can break or save lives, make enemies or friends, start
war or create peace. Buddha explained right speech as follows:

1.  to abstain from false speech, especially not to tell deliberate lies
    and not to speak deceitfully.
2.  to abstain from slanderous speech and not to use words maliciously
    against others.
3.  to abstain from harsh words that offend or hurt others.
4.  to abstain from idle chatter that lacks purpose or depth.

Positively phrased, this means to tell the truth, to speak friendly,
warm, and gently and to talk only when necessary. **4. Right Action**
The second ethical principle, right action, involves the body as natural
means of expression, as it refers to deeds that involve bodily actions.
Unwholesome actions lead to unsound states of mind, while wholesome
actions lead to sound states of mind. Again, the principle is explained
in terms of abstinence: right action means

1.  to abstain from harming sentient beings, especially to abstain from
    taking life (including suicide) and doing harm intentionally or
    delinquently.
2.  to abstain from taking what is not given, which includes stealing,
    robbery, fraud, deceitfulness, and dishonesty.
3.  to abstain from sexual misconduct.

Positively formulated, right action means to act kindly and
compassionately, to be honest, to respect the belongings of others, and
to keep sexual relationships harmless to others. Further details
regarding the concrete meaning of right action can be found in the
Buddhist Precepts. **5. Right Livelihood** Right livelihood means that
one should earn one's living in a righteous way and that wealth should
be gained legally and peacefully. The Buddha mentions four specific
activities that harm other beings and that one should avoid for this
reason:

1.  dealing in weapons.
2.  dealing in living beings (including raising animals for slaughter as
    well as slave trade and prostitution).
3.  working in meat production and butchery.
4.  selling intoxicants and poisons, such as alcohol and drugs.

Furthermore any other occupation that would violate the principles of
right speech and right action should be avoided. **6. Right Effort**
Right effort can be seen as a prerequisite for the other principles of
the path. Without effort, which is in itself an act of will, nothing can
be achieved, whereas misguided effort distracts the mind from its task,
and confusion will be the consequence. Mental energy is the force behind
right effort; it can occur in either wholesome or unwholesome states.
The same type of energy that fuels desire, envy, aggression, and
violence can on the other side fuel self-discipline, honesty,
benevolence, and kindness. Right effort is detailed in four types of
endeavors that rank in ascending order of perfection:

1.  to prevent the arising of unarisen unwholesome states.
2.  to abandon unwholesome states that have already arisen.
3.  to arouse wholesome states that have not yet arisen.
4.  to maintain and perfect wholesome states already arisen.

**7. Right Mindfulness** Right mindfulness is the controlled and
perfected faculty of cognition. It is the mental ability to see things
as they are, with clear consciousness. Usually, the cognitive process
begins with an impression induced by perception, or by a thought, but
then it does not stay with the mere impression. Instead, we almost
always conceptualize sense impressions and thoughts immediately. We
interpret them and set them in relation to other thoughts and
experiences, which naturally go beyond the facticity of the original
impression. The mind then posits concepts, joins concepts into
constructs, and weaves those constructs into complex interpretative
schemes. All this happens only half consciously, and as a result we
often see things obscured. Right mindfulness is anchored in clear
perception and it penetrates impressions without getting carried away.
Right mindfulness enables us to be aware of the process of
conceptualization in a way that we actively observe and control the way
our thoughts go. Buddha accounted for this as the *four foundations of
mindfulness:*

1.  contemplation of the body.
2.  contemplation of feeling (repulsive, attractive, or neutral).
3.  contemplation of the state of mind.
4.  contemplation of the phenomena.

**8. Right Concentration** The eighth principle of the path, right
concentration, refers to the development of a mental force that occurs
in natural consciousness, although at a relatively low level of
intensity, namely concentration. Concentration in this context is
described as one-pointedness of mind, meaning a state where all mental
faculties are unified and directed onto one particular object. Right
concentration for the purpose of the eightfold path means wholesome
concentration, i.e. concentration on wholesome thoughts and actions. The
Buddhist method of choice to develop right concentration is through the
practice of meditation. The meditating mind focuses on a selected
object. It first directs itself onto it, then sustains concentration,
and finally intensifies concentration step by step. Through this
practice it becomes natural to apply elevated levels concentration also
in everyday situations.
