<p>My cat has breast cancer. I noticed a smallish lump (or something) in Freya&#39;s 
belly a while back but didn&#39;t think much of it at the time as she has long hair 
and difficulty cleaning herself well at time. She gets knots in her hair and 
needs to have things brushed out and she&#39;s not big on having her belly brushed. 
Recently, I noticed that there was a much larger mass along her left side and it 
seemed to be subdermal and solid.</p>
<p>I took her to the vet this week and they examined the lump and took some 
samples. They ran some tests and they came back as the vet expected: cancer. 
It&#39;s in her mammary glands, both the upper and lower sets, on the left side. He 
found another smallish lump at the top of the right side so it has spread.</p>
<p>I&#39;m taking her in for x-rays next week. We have to see if it has metastasized 
and spread to other parts of her body or if it is just in the glands. This type 
of cancer is almost always malignant. If it hasn&#39;t spread, I can have surgery to 
open her up and remove all of that tissue, though it stretches the full length 
of one side. I haven&#39;t made up my mind of what to do. </p>
<p>Money isn&#39;t the issue but I also don&#39;t want to spend massive money if it is 
going to impact her quality of life and just put something off. We&#39;ll see what 
the x-rays say. I raised her from a kitten, the first cat that I have ever had 
its entire life (expect for about a year or so in the middle). She&#39;s not a 
terribly lovey cat and, frankly, she&#39;s kind of a bitch calico kitty but she&#39;s 
been my responsibility. </p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure how I feel about the whole thing.</p>
