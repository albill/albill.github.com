This is the face of terror and I don't mean the poor fucker in the orange jumpsuit. He may or may not have done anything. He may or may not ever get a real day in court with a judge and lawyer facing his accusers but this treatment (of a fellow citizen!) is horrific. It's a wonder that he hasn't gone insane in isolation.

This is us in the mirror, folks.
