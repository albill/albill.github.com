![Swat
Buddha](http://www.arcanology.com/images/swat_buddha.jpg "Swat Buddha")The
[BBC is reporting](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6991058.stm)
that Islamic militants in Pakistan have attacked another ancient (and
rather large) statue of the Buddha. As with the Taliban attacks, which
successfully destroyed other ancient Buddhist statues, this attack was
carried out using explosives. The image in question is the largest in
Asia after the two Bamiyan Buddhas and is over 2,000 years old. It was
only minimally damaged in the blasts due to its position and the rock
around it. As some may recall, this region is home to a number of
Ancient Buddhist kingdoms, which were the descendants of the Greek-ruled
kingdoms created by Alexander the Great. The most famous of these is
[Gandhara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandhara), which I believe ruled
over the Swat valley where this statue resides. Gandhara is home to the
earliest depictions of the Buddha as a human being. Earlier imagery used
Buddhist symbolism but avoided depictions of the Buddha as a man. These
depictions show a strong influence from Greek artistic traditions. I
have a couple of examples below from the [Asian Art
Museum](http://www.asianart.org/) in San Francisco, where they have a
large section of Buddhis art. These are pictures that I took last year:

Gandhara is also the home to some of the earliest surviving written
copies of Buddhist sutras, which have been discovered buried in recent
years. Because of this history of the region and it being a strong point
where the Greek culture of the West met with the cultures of India, I've
always found this area to be fascinating. The destruction of the
heritage of this region is a barbaric act. These statues have withstood
thousands of years, including the Muslim conquest of this region. Why
destroy them now except as an act of short-sightedness and hatred?
