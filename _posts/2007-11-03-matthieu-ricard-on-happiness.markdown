The <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks">Talks page</a> on the <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED site</a> has a talk done by Matthieu Ricard in 2004 on happiness, its development, and generally the idea of developing habits of happiness and mind. Ricard is a former scientist who is now a Tibetan Buddhist monk. He has written several books, two of them are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Lotus-Journey-Frontiers-Buddhism/dp/1400080797/"><strong class="sans">The Quantum and the Lotus</strong></a><span class="sans"> and </span><strong class="sans"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Guide-Developing-Lifes-Important/dp/0316167258">Happiness: A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important Skill</a></strong>. The talk is obviously more focused on the areas of his second book. I found the video to be interesting in that it is a simple explanation of why the study of mental states is important, whether one is a Buddhist or not. I also think that he's a relatively engaging speaker. You can <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/191">watch the video or download it</a> on the TED site. <lj-embed></lj-embed> There are many interesting talks available from the last few years of TED conferences.
