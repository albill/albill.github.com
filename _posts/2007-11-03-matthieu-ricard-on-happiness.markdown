The [Talks page](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks) on the [TED
site](http://www.ted.com/) has a talk done by Matthieu Ricard in 2004 on
happiness, its development, and generally the idea of developing habits
of happiness and mind. Ricard is a former scientist who is now a Tibetan
Buddhist monk. He has written several books, two of them are [**The
Quantum and the
Lotus**](http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Lotus-Journey-Frontiers-Buddhism/dp/1400080797/)
and **[Happiness: A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important
Skill](http://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Guide-Developing-Lifes-Important/dp/0316167258)**.
The talk is obviously more focused on the areas of his second book. I
found the video to be interesting in that it is a simple explanation of
why the study of mental states is important, whether one is a Buddhist
or not. I also think that he's a relatively engaging speaker. You can
[watch the video or download

There are many interesting talks available from the last few years of
TED conferences. You can get an RSS feed of them for downloading in your
