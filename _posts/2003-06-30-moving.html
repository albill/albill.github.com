Wow, moving is a real bitch. We&apos;ve been three days nearly non-stop moving crap around, cleaning and unpacking. I took Friday off from work, packed some more, and the movers showed up just before 1:00 pm. We moved with them until 6:30 pm (we helped load and unload as well). Then we did some unpacking. Saturday, we got up, ate breakfast and then went to the old house to clean with Autumn. We were there until 4:30 or so. Then I got a couple of hours to myself, ate some food and then went home and unpacked some more!

Repeat ad nauseum.

As of this morning, my library is 90% unpacked but disorganized. My computer is set up (on my new computer desk that I also went and bought this weekend). The TV and its many lovers are unpacked and plugged in. The kitchen and living room are still largely unpacked but the bedroom is looking a lot better too.

We have no phone, no cable, no DSL, nada zip nothing. I can do my latin and read and hang out with Rebecca. That&apos;s our life at the moment.

I&apos;ll start reading backwards in LJ if I get the time today.
