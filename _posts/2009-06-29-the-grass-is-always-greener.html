My friend, <a href="http://zangthal.blogspot.com/">Jason</a>, posted this picture today:

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/3673770826/" title="meditation cartoon by albill, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3396/3673770826_6da9542836.jpg" width="500" height="395" alt="meditation cartoon" /></a></div>

I find it hilarious because I'm sure there are moments during meditation or retreats where everyone feels like this, at least for a moment. Of course, the grass isn't always greener and there is "only this." I have to remind myself of this at times, when I start engaging in various kinds of seeking behavior. 

Jason also has a good point on his <a href="http://zangthal.blogspot.com/2009/06/you-cannot-suck-at-meditation-i-meet.html">blog post</a> where I found this picture called, "You cannot suck at meditation." I have met various people over the years who said, "Oh yeah, I tried to meditate but I just suck at it." I always wonder what they thought successful meditation was like (versus what they were getting). I have a feeling that their experiences were not markedly different than those of mine (or others) but that they expected something different.
