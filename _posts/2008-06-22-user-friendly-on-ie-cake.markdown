Apparently, the popular web comic [User
Friendly](http://www.userfriendly.org/) just did a cartoon about the
[cake that Internet Explorer sent to
Mozilla](http://www.arcanology.com/2008/06/17/ie-sends-mozilla-a-new-cake-for-firefox-3/)
the other day when we shipped Firefox 3. You can [see it on their
site](http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20080622) in full size
but I've added it below in a smaller size as well:

This cake has gotten far more press than I think anyone expected. I
guess people like it when conflicts can proceed with a certain amount of
grace. As has been suggested, when IE8 ships, we should send the IE team
a cake as well but we'll make sure to include the recipe with it so they
can make more of them... Oh, and I like the little "The cake is a lie!"
nod in the tiny cake graphic beneath the cake. :-)
