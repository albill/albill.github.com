As most of my friends know, I took her on a surprise trip to Victoria, B.C. for her birthday, which was on May 5. I explained that she needed to be home by 12:30 pm sharp with her bags packed and ready to go. She got home a little early so we dropped her car off at the shop and got a little drive through for lunch. I then turned the car around and parked it about a mile from the drive through.

I knew that she was expecting us to go to Canada because I'd been required to get her passport information from her in order to book the trip. I figured that she assumed that we were either taking a ferry of some sort or driving up to the border. What she didn't realize is that the seaplane place that we drive by all of the time flies directly to Victoria and other islands in Puget Sound. She was quite surprised when I just pulled over and said &quot;We're here. Let's go.&quot;

We hung out for about 30 minutes waiting for our plane and then took the 40 minute flight directly to Victoria's inner harbor. That's pretty damn convenient. The plane had a total of four passengers and two pilots so it was pretty small. When we got on, they handed us earplugs for a reason.
