![image](http://www.arcanology.com/images/teachings.gif)I'm going to go
to Conway, MA in September to the Dzogchen Community's annual retreat
with Namkhai Norbu. I've been planning this for a while but hadn't
commited to anything. I just sunk the cash in for it to pay for the
retreat today and, minutes ago, I purchased the plane tickets as well.
I'm taking off September 9 in the morning to attend the second retreat
that starts the next day. I'll be returning September 14 late in the
evening. Information about the retreat can be found at
[http://www.tsegyalgar.org](http://www.tsegyalgar.org/index.html). The
weekend before, I'm going to Minneapolis to spend time with the Ordo
Astrum Sophiae... Oh yeah, and at the end of September, R and I are
going to [Twilight Gathering](http://www.twilightgathering.org) with Sam
and Tara Webster and their crew of hellions. September suddenly seems
pretty busy.
