I&apos;ve been planning this for a while but hadn&apos;t commited to anything. I just sunk the cash in for it to pay for the retreat today and, minutes ago, I purchased the plane tickets as well.

I&apos;m taking off September 9 in the morning to attend the second retreat that starts the next day. I&apos;ll be returning September 14 late in the evening.

Information about the retreat can be found at <a href="http://www.tsegyalgar.org/index.html">http://www.tsegyalgar.org</a>.

The weekend before, I&apos;m going to Minneapolis to spend time with the Ordo Astrum Sophiae...

Oh yeah, and at the end of September, R and I are going to <a href="http://www.twilightgathering.org">Twilight Gathering</a> with Sam and Tara Webster and their crew of hellions. September suddenly seems pretty busy.
