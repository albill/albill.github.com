Today, people are getting ready for [Air
Mozilla](http://air.mozilla.com/), which goes live tomorrow at 2:00 PM
PDT. We'll be doing live streaming with a variety of people. Asa
[blogged about
this](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2007/07/relaunch_of_air.html)
the other day and was used as a test dummy as systems were calibrated

encourage everyone to tune in tomorrow if you have a chance.
