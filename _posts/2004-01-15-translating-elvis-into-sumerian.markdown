> "I must admit translating Elvis into Sumerian was not easy, but it was
> an interesting experience, and I learned a lot in the process. The
> main difficulty was lexical: because of the great distance in time and
> hence differences in culture -- Sumerian became extinct as a spoken
> language about 1800 BC -- it was difficult to find Sumerian
> equivalents for certain modern concepts and words. For example, the
> Sumerians of course didn't have nylon socks, so I had to improvise and
> made it "cotton boots," **šuhub gu**. (I resolutely resisted the
> temptation to take the easy road and use modern words as loan words in
> Sumerian, which would have ruined the whole experiment). It took me
> some time to solve this problem, because there does not exist a
> dictionary where you could simply look these things up. The only
> modern dictionary of Sumerian, the *Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary,*
> ed. Å. Sjöberg (Sumerian-English, not English-Sumerian!), has not yet
> advanced beyond the letters A and B!"
