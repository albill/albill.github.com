R and I attended our first full Aikido class at <a href="http://www.aikiarts.com/">Aiki Arts</a> yesterday. I think that we can safely say that the class kicked our asses. Even though the pace was relatively slow and people were easy on me as the FNG, I was pretty much hitting the wall physically by the end. R probably was not doing much better but we actually did not work together during the class as we are both so new.

I took Aikido for about a year in high school and I took another, hard boxing, style for about two years from 1994 through 1996. I haven't taken anything since then and have progressively moved more and more away from any sense of fitness. I've lost a lot of weight over the last six or seven months (about thirty pounds) but that doesn't make me fit, just not as fat.

The hope with the Aikido is to do something involving my body since almost all of my other activities are pretty sendentary from computer work through my school work and then ritual practice. One would also hope that it will help with grace and general movement. We'll see.
