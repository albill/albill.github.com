I&apos;m going to start posting aphorisms from <i>The Art of Worldly Wisdom</i> Baltasar Gracian. He was a Jesuit priest who lived in northeast Spain in the 17th century. The book consists of 300 pithy sayings, on politics, professional life, and personal development.

Everything is at its peak of perfection. This is especially true of the art of making one&apos;s way in the world.
There is more required nowadays to make a single wise person than formerly to make the Seven Sages
of Ancient Greece, and more is needed nowadays to deal with a single person than was required with a whole
people in former times.</center>
