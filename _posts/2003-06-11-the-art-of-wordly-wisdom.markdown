I'm going to start posting aphorisms from *The Art of Worldly Wisdom*
Baltasar Gracian. He was a Jesuit priest who lived in northeast Spain in
the 17th century. The book consists of 300 pithy sayings, on politics,
professional life, and personal development.
**1** Everything is at its peak of perfection. This is especially true
of the art of making one's way in the world. There is more required
nowadays to make a single wise person than formerly to make the Seven
Sages of Ancient Greece, and more is needed nowadays to deal with a
single person than was required with a whole people in former times.
