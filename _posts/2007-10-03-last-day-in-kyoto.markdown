Today was our last day in Kyoto. Tomorrow, we take a series of trains to
arrive at Koyasan. We went to the Gion district today to have a peek.
While there, we visited Kennin-ji, the oldest Zen temple in Japan.
Kennin-ji has a quite nice zen garden in the complex as well as some
impressive paintings in the main temple.
