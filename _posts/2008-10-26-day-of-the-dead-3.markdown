*Our Day of the Dead Altar for this year*

I am feeling slightly better today so R and I decided to get out of the
house for a while. In Fruitvale (part of Oakland) there is a [Day of the
Dead festival](http://www.unitycouncil.org/ddlm/index.htm). This is a
sort of streetfair with Day of the Dead altars, vendors, food, music,
etc. We'd spoken about going earlier in the week so it seemed a good
opportunity to do something.

*Frida Kahlo Day of the Dead altar*

It turned out to be bigger than we had expected and packed. We wandered
around for a while and I picked up a couple of things to add to our own
Day of the Dead altar. We usually buy one small thing every year (except
the year when we were in Mexico where we bought a bunch of stuff). R
picked up a new sugar skull to replace the rather tired one that we've
had for a few years since we never eat them. I took a few photos of some
of the altars on display. The large one for Oakland deaths was more
tragic than most.

Oakland Deaths Day of the Dead altar

This year, we only know one person who has died and we were not
extremely close. In the last couple of years before that, R and I have
both lost family members. I hope that the coming year is without loss
but that is hardly a choice anyone gets to make.
