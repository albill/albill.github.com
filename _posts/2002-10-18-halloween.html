So, R and I are discussing Halloween costumes and I'm not sure what it should be this year for me. Last year, I was a clown (obviously) and she was a mime.

So, I made a poll for suggestions. I would appreciate <strong><em>real</em></strong> suggestions not just displays of your sterling wit. ;-)
