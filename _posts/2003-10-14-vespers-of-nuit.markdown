A ritual created by Sor. Ashera based on traditional Gnostic and Orthodox forms. The sources include The Book of the Law and other writings by Aleister Crowley, Fra. Achad, ancient Egyptian prayers Thelemic ritual and original work. The Vespers are suitable for private individual use or in a group. They are particularly effective performed under the stars, immediately prior to an evening Gnostic Mass or following an afternoon one. The words of Nuit herself along with prayers both ancient and modern provide an atmosphere of connection and worship. This 30 minute devotional will be led by Sor. Ashera, an ordained E.G.C. Deacon and past Notocon presenter. Booklets provided. <hr width="50%" />
