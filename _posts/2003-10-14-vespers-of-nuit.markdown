**The Vespers Of Nuit - A Devotional Rite To Nuit** "Having come to
sunset and beholding the evening light, We hymn the Lady, Queen of
Heaven: Goddess, Meet it is at all times that Thou be hymned with
fitting voices." A ritual created by Sor. Ashera based on traditional
Gnostic and Orthodox forms. The sources include The Book of the Law and
other writings by Aleister Crowley, Fra. Achad, ancient Egyptian prayers
Thelemic ritual and original work. The Vespers are suitable for private
individual use or in a group. They are particularly effective performed
under the stars, immediately prior to an evening Gnostic Mass or
following an afternoon one. The words of Nuit herself along with prayers
both ancient and modern provide an atmosphere of connection and worship.
This 30 minute devotional will be led by Sor. Ashera, an ordained E.G.C.
Deacon and past Notocon presenter. Booklets provided.
