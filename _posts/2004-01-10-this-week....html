I haven't posted much this week. It's been fairly busy at work but not too bad. We're working on a big patch and we also have ongoing work with the Service Pack 2 for Windows XP. Those that care about such things probably heard about the Beta for that which MS released a few weeks back. Along with a lot of addressing of root security vulnurabilities in a lot of areas (RPC, IE, OE, etc) it includes some new features for IE like Pop-Up Management, Management of Active-X controls, etc. The latter work is all tested by my immediate direct reports. On the personal front, I met with a British Traditional Wiccan High Priestess friend of mine of many years over coffee and dinner. It looks like I'll be working with her on her training of a small group of people new to Brit Trad Craft. I had some training in this over 12 years ago and have been speaking with her about doing more official training, getting initiated into their lineage properly, etc. She's also interested in doing this in an organized fashion that will allow us to have an organized curriculum that I (and ) can use in our Prison Ministry work with the guys at McNeil Island. I don't know how often the Wiccan group will meet but I expect it to be a couple of times a month. I'm also turning in my application for the local Masonic lodge that has OTO members actively playing a role in it within the next few days. This brings my likely regular ritual/groups commitments to:

We meet a few times a month and at other odd times to do regular ritual work on Ogdoadic lines and to continue to pursue the training relating to our initiation. This is my main ritual focus most of the time.

It isn't super active most of the time but they generally do a ganapuja on the full moons (as measured on the Tibetan Calendar) and I want to make a regular presence there. On a personal level, I'm trying to integrate the medium Tun ritual, which is basic Dzogchen ritual work, into my regular practice.

This doesn't meet yet but there will be a monthly discussion going here.
