As some people have no doubt noticed, quite a few posts have broken images. I changed one of my longterm Internet domains recently and it was where my non-Flickr images were hosted. I've fixed a lot of image links but I've missed a few. If you notice a post with broken images on it, please leave a comment and I'll fix it. Otherwise, it is a matter of time as I go through four years or so worth of blog posts.
