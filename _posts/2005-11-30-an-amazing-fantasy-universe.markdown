This is amazing. I just read through the author biography on the site
and a few other bits.

> **The Saga of The Saga**
>
> Four days isn't a lot of time to weave an entire fantasy world of
> whole cloth. Yet in less than a week, scores of people from all across
> the world have crafted the Epic Legends of the Hierarchs: The
> Elemenstor Saga, a detailed history of the world of Battal, where
> powerful wizards seek adventure with ambulatory furniture at their
> side.
>
> Spanning more than 1,400 articles, the Epic Legends of the Hierarchs
> -- or as fans have unpronounceably abbreviated it, ELOTH:TES -- has
> all the trappings of modern fantasy franchises: a rich history that
> spans thousands of years; a contentiously out-of-canon cartoon
> offshoot, The Wizbits; as well as a crazed, seizure-ridden chief
> creative director, [James
> Langomedes](http://elothtes.pbwiki.com/James%20Langomedes) (an obvious
> caricature of mad comics genius Alan Moore).
>
> But despite references to 28 years of "real world" history, The Saga
> never really existed, at least in the conventional sense.
>
> Spawned this past week from a single page of material posted on a
> public wiki by web comic [Penny Arcade](http://penny-arcade.com/)
> scribe Jerry "Tycho" Holkins, The Saga is a fan-driven parody of the
> banal fiction that serves as a backdrop to the majority of modern
> fantasy game franchises.
>
> "(These worlds) are the half-ass bullshit used to underlie the
> money-printing extravaganza," of game systems like Wizard of the
> Coast's Magic: The Gathering collectable card game, explained Holkins.
> The Saga exists in part to prove the facileness of such back stories
> and in part to acknowledge the culpability of fantasy fans who buy it
> all, no matter the quality. The wiki is the "joke that everyone is in
> on," said Holkins.

The rest of the article goes into it a bit more...
