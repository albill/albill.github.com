I just found this on the <a href="http://www.sakya.org">Sakya Monastery's website</a> at <a href="http://www.sakya.org/VEI/hevajra5-24.htm">http://www.sakya.org/VEI/hevajra5-24.htm</a>.
I've been waiting for them to offer this and this is the first time I think they've done it in a while. $200 though! Yowza!

<strong>Hevajra Initiation</strong>

(for advanced practitioners and those committed to doing Hevajra Practice daily.)

<strong>Taught by:
<a href="http://www.sakya.org/SakyaMonastery/Lamas/jdsbio.htm">H. H. Jigdal Dagchen Sakya</a></strong>

Sakya Monastery
<strong>May 24 at 7:00 pm
May 25 at 1:00 pm </strong>

<strong><em>Suggested Donation: $200 Public/ $150 Sakya Monastery Members</em></strong>

<strong>Background:</strong>
H.H. Dagchen Rinpoche received this two-day Hevajra Anuttarayoga initiation in an unbroken Khon Lineage transmission from the great founder of the Sayka School, Sachen Kunga Nyingpo (1092- 1158), through the last Sakya Throne-holder in Tibet, His Holiness Trichen Ngawang Tutop Wangcchuk (1900-1950), Rinpocheâ€™s father.

Havajra is the most important meditational practice in the Sakya tradition.
It matures disciples through planting seeds for the realization of the four bodies of the Buddha, empowers one to practice the Shri Hevarja Sadhana, and is a necessary prerequisite to receiving many other teachings such as the Vajrayogini Initiation.

Registration is due by May 15th
789-2573 or <a href="mailto:monastery@sakya.org">monastery@sakya.org</a>

Limited to 25 students.
If an additional 25 students register, there will be an additional date on May 22 and May 23 at 7 pm.
