I survived the night. Around 4:30 AM, I tried to crawl into a corner to
sleep. I chose behind a row of seats in the theatre. This would have
been a better choice if people hadn't decided to use the Xbox 360 to
play **Fight Night** while I was sleeping starting about 5:30 AM. I had
weird dozing dreams of Mohammad Ali kicking ass boxing. Around 7:30 AM,
someone opened all the curtains and people revived. It turned out that
the caterers had arrived and we were about to get breakfast. Thought
luck of the draw, I managed to get breakfast first. I've been skipping
sessions this morning and talking geek shop with people. I've been video
blogged twice now (once for my tattoo). One of these is up at
codeforfood.org
[here](http://codeforfood.org/2006/04/30/my-very-first-5th-attempt-at-a-video-blog-post/).
We're doing the closing at 11:00 and a raffle. I'm hoping to win the
Xbox 360.
