I survived the night.

Around 4:30 AM, I tried to crawl into a corner to sleep. I chose behind a row of seats in the theatre. This would have been a better choice if people hadn't decided to use the Xbox 360 to play <strong>Fight Night</strong> while I was sleeping starting about 5:30 AM. I had weird dozing dreams of Mohammad Ali kicking ass boxing.

Around 7:30 AM, someone opened all the curtains and people revived. It turned out that the caterers had arrived and we were about to get breakfast. Thought luck of the draw, I managed to get breakfast first.

I've been skipping sessions this morning and talking geek shop with people. I've been video blogged twice now (once for my tattoo). One of these is up at codeforfood.org <a href="http://codeforfood.org/2006/04/30/my-very-first-5th-attempt-at-a-video-blog-post/">here</a>.

We're doing the closing at 11:00 and a raffle. I'm hoping to win the Xbox 360.
