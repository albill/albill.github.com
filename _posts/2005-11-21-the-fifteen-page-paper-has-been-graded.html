<p>I just received word from my Para-Rational Perspectives professor. He  received my paper this morning and decided to just go ahead and read it. He's  mailing it back with comments but he replied to my e-mail (where I told him that  it was on the way) stating that it was an 'A' paper. Whew. 40% of my grade for  this 15 page paper. R thought it was better than some I'd written and that my  writing has improved but it is nice to have the grade. I'll read his comments  when I receive the physical copy back but that means I've received an 'A' on 80%  of my credit for my class. I'd better not screw up the last paper.</p> <p>It's hard to tell, oftentimes, what the grades really mean. I suppose if  there are more variability it would be more meaningful but I've gotten an 'A'  for every paper this year except for a single paper for which I received a high  'B'. One starts to wonder if you are:</p> <ol><li>Trying harder than most of your peers.</li><li>Whether they are grading on a curve or not.</li><li>Whether the classes are being graded more lightly than they should.</li><li>Suffering from swollen brain syndrome.</li></ol> <p>I'm a smart guy, I know this, but I'm not scary smart. I work with a few  people like that. Of course, when you work around really intelligent people  constantly, one tends to lose a coherent idea of what 'average' is in this  world. I hope that I am getting 'A' grades because I'm a 34 year old college  student who is mature, verbally gifted and challenged by the program and not  because it is actually a cake walk in some way.</p>
