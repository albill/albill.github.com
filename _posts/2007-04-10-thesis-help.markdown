I wanted to give a big shout out to <a href="http://danharms.wordpress.com/">Dan Harms</a> for helping me with my thesis. He is the author of the <strong>Encyclopedia Cthulhiana</strong> and the co-author of <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1578632692">The Necronomicon Files</a></strong>. Dan was one of the people that volunteered to submit his mind to my turgid writing in the draft that I have of my first four thesis chapters. Dan is an accomplished writer and, as it turns out, has a Master's thesis of his own in an area not terribly far removed. Dan gave me a bunch of feedback, especially on the chapter on the Golden Dawn's esotericism and initiation structure. He suggested an alternate ordering of the material that, on reflection, makes pretty good sense. He did all of this within 24 hours of getting the draft, which is not terribly short. I really appreciate his help in this. Thanks, Dan!
