<p>R and I just got back from spending the evening out with our friend, Phil. I 
always find talking to him and spending time in his presence to be both 
interesting and inspirational in a sense. </p>
<p>Phil is not far from 70 years old. He fought in Korea and volunteered for 
Vietnam. He was later involved in anti-war work. He&#39;s been a lawyer, an artist, 
and a number of other things, I&#39;m sure. He&#39;s also been HIV+ for more than 20 
years now. I know from talking to him that he&#39;s had about as many horrid or 
life-wrenching events happen as any three or four people. All of that being 
said, he&#39;s one of the most positive and joyous people that I&#39;ve ever met in my 
life. He&#39;s got the best attitude I&#39;ve ever seen and he&#39;s genuinely warm, 
compassionate and forgiving. </p>
<p>With all that he&#39;s been through or seen, many people would have crumpled and 
I&#39;m sure that Despair is an old friend that he&#39;s learned to welcome on occasion 
but...he&#39;s just an amazing guy. He&#39;s also a great example that you don&#39;t have to 
make yourself a relic sitting in a rocking chair as you age. You can learn new 
things, create, drive projects on many fronts, have lovers, and generally <b>
LIVE</b> even when you&#39;re older and even living with a disease that could kill 
you soon and drive you to giving up.</p>
<p>He&#39;s a wonderful dinner table companion and I had a great time speaking to 
him and R tonight. He&#39;s one of those rare people that isn&#39;t out of my normal 
social circle of pagan malcontents or geeks but whom I can discuss philosophy or 
life with clearly and know that I&#39;m being understood. Hell, he has many insights 
that I don&#39;t hear from others and I don&#39;t often get to just talk to people 
without having to be self-conscious about topic matter or mode of discourse. My 
interests or directions are obscure or odd enough that R is one of the few 
people that I can really talk to about what I&#39;m thinking. Phil, I think, is 
likely to be one of the others over time.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been fortunate to meet him through R. She&#39;s worked with him as a 
volunteer for years and became friends with him in that same context. If she and 
I weren&#39;t together, I never would have met him and it would have been a loss.</p>
