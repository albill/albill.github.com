<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/2722473825/" title="highlander by albill, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3002/2722473825_140980a22e_m.jpg" align="right" border="1" width="171" height="240" alt="highlander" hspace="10" /></a> I and many other Mozilla people are in the Vancouver airport now. We survived the six or seven hour bus ride in order to hang out at the airport for a few hours.

<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7535840.stm">From the news</a>, I see that bus rides in Canada can be a dangerous experience. Luckily, no one went all "Highlander" on us and we arrived intact. I expect that Canada will end its attempts to kill us now.

Now I need coffee to go with the three or so hours of sleep. <br clear="all">
