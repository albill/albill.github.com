Our offer on the house that I posted about the other day has gone
through! This is the Arts and Crafts house with the original floors,
box-beam ceiling in the dining room, and the brick front that I wrote
about last week. We made an offer on it before we left town (nice timing
but then I was in Wyoming when we were trying to sell our place in
Seattle). There was one minor adjustment that required us to find a fax
machine and printer here in Mexico but no major issues. It is being
appraised on Wednesday (tomorrow) and inspected on the following Tuesday
(November 7). Assuming no more issues are found, it should all go
through. California has rather draconian disclosure laws compared to
other states and the house has had a $33,000 new foundation and a new
roof in the last two years so we don't expect anything to turn up. The
house is near the joint borders of Emeryville, Oakland, and Berkeley on
the Oakland side. That's too bad as Emeryville has an easier tax burden.
It is a little bit off of San Pablo near 67th and a bit under a mile
from the Ashby BART station. The house, as a whole, has about 1,250 sq.
ft. in three bedrooms plus a utility room. It has a full dining room and
living room along with a fair sized kitchen. We're going to evaluate the
attic, which seems to be large, for a potential conversion as well.
