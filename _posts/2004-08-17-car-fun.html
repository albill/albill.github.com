I was on my way to pick up my daughter for dinner and I started here a metal on metal (like disks rubbing together) from my driver side brakes... It would go lessen as I hit the brakes and then stop altogether when the brakes engaged. It happened for about two minutes, then it quit happening to I kept driving thinking "Should I turn around?" but I was most of the way there and didn't have my phone. When I was almost to my grandparents' place to get her, it did it again for a couple of blocks and then stopped making sound.

I visited with her and my grandparents for a few and then headed back. There was the same kind of on and off noise making on the way back. Something is grinding on something in my brakes, though they seemed as responsive as normal.

I pulled in there. It's owned by a guy named "Steve" (go figure...even he made a joke about it). R and I drive by it all of the time and it also has a mess of cars in various states of disrepair in front of it. Obviously someone's small automotive business.

He had me give him my personal information and I left the car there with them. He'll look at my brakes tomorrow and let me know what the damage is. I haven't had my brakes repaired or really worked on since I got the car three years ago (three this week, in fact) so I expect that I'm going to be replacing a bunch of parts. Ah well. Happy birthday to me!
