Ok, as much as I've bitched about Apple lately, I have to admit that
their new phone is incredibly sexy looking.
![image](http://www.arcanology.com/images/ipwn.jpg) I use a Sprint 6700
PocketPC phone. I like it quite a bit but it is a brick and a functional
device. Sometimes not even that functional. The new Apple phone actually
runs OS X, has Wifi, and 8GB of storage. Who can complain about that?
