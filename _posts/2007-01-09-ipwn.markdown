Ok, as much as I've bitched about Apple lately, I have to admit that their new phone is incredibly sexy looking.

I use a Sprint 6700 PocketPC phone. I like it quite a bit but it is a brick and a functional device. Sometimes not even that functional. The new Apple phone actually runs OS X, has Wifi, and 8GB of storage. Who can complain about that?
