Would you like an exercise in frustration? Try getting KDE or Gnome (or X in general) to work with a twin-headed Nvidia video card in order to use two monitors in Ubuntu (or Kubuntu in my case). This is a trivial task in Windows XP or Windows Vista but getting both of my monitors to work at the same time in KDE or Gnome is a a nightmare task. I managed to completely screw up my xorg.conf file yesterday. Luckily, when Kubuntu can't start KDE, it just drops to a command line. I copied the old xorg.conf back and then I could run KDE again (on one monitor). *sigh*
