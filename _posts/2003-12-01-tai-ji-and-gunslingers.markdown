I'm back at work from my five day weekend. That was rather nice, I must say.

In the course of the weekend, R and I bought and set up a new TV cabinet so our living room looks a bit nicer. It's a big, dark wood piece with shelves to hold all of our appliances. We also bought a brand new bed from Bombay Import but we haven't had a chance to set it up yet. Now that we have a house, it seems that we need to get real furniture like big kids.

On Saturday, I read the re-release of <strong>The Gunslinger</strong> by Stephen King. This was the somewhat revised/rewritten version that he just put out since he's committed to finally finishing the whole series after his near-death experience the other year. I read the first version at least 12 years ago so it is hard to say how different it is. There are scenes that I don't remember but then I don't clearly remember the last third of the book. I'm also quite a bit older and in a different place in life than when I read it before. I must say that I liked it quite a bit and I don't normally read Stephen King anymore since most of his recent work doesn't do anything for me. I did read the book in one day and I'm now 100 pages into <strong>The Drawing of the Three</strong>, which I thought I'd read back in the day but none of it is familiar at all so I'm thinking that I never got around to it.

I'm planning on reading all of the available paperbacks during this holiday season and maybe I'll get to the new hardcover by new year's.

I'm also working through <strong>Yoga for Dummies</strong>, which sounds innane until you realize that one of the co-authors is Georg Feurstein, who is a world reknown yoga expert. I have a number of his books on various topics and have been very impressed by him. R and I are thinking about doing yoga together if we can find a class that works well for both of us.

Along that line of thought, we went to Tylik's first Tai Ji class yesterday in Redmond. I think that we both had a good time and I'm looking forward to continuing that class. It won't be easy. I am woefully out of shape. I did martial arts for a few years but that was seven years ago and I'm too many years on the wrong side of a desk job. It is convincing me that I need to start actually working out reliably again. Along with flexibility, I need to start getting into better shape overall.

I've been doing a lot of reading lately of Ken Wilber's work, the work of people like Michael Murphy and George Leonard on spiritual practices, meditation and what-not from outside of the "occult" traditions. I'm becoming more and more convinced over time that while the Western magical traditions have a lot of value, that focusing on practices, work, philosophy and what-not from <strong>only</strong> within that tradition artificially constrains what people are making available to themselves to work with. I think a lot of occultists and pagans focus too much on the "let's cast a spell" or "let's do magic" end of things and not enough on the "let's deal with the life I am given" or "let's develop myself, my compassion and my spiritual evolution." Those things involve a lot more than learning to do the LBRP the right way. I think that everything someone needs <em><strong>can</strong></em> be found in the Western tradition but it is often pretty well buried and has a lot to do with the intent of how people approach worship, ritual work and the Divine, in whatever form. So many occultists seemed concerned with things that are, at the end of the day (or your life), fairly superficial. I'm interested in other people and helping them with their lives and the pain in them on some level, even if I don't know how to do so. I'm not interested in being a cool Crowley-clone.
