So, there is this fellow in my Latin class named "Jacob." I ran into him before class (when we were both studying) at the Victrola Cafe this evening. We chatted for a few minutes and he mentioned that he worked at the Speakeasy. I said, "Oh, a friend of mine's girlfriend works there too. She's some kind of lead in Customer Support." He said, "What's her name?" and I said "Deb." He then tells me that that's his boss... So, Sarastro's girlfriend is the boss of one of my classmates. How's that for a small world?
