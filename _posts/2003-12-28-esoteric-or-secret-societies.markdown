Can anyone name any English or America esoteric societies, secret societies or interesting fraternal orders that have not been well studied academically? I'm looking at various posibilities around a masters thesis topic regarding either history, religious studies or the like and this is one of my areas of interest. I can think of a number of groups but I may be missing or forgetting some.

Obviously, the OTO is on the short list but since I'm a member I'm not likely to deconstruct its mythos, ritual work, etc. for the purposes of a MA thesis. The American tantrik order that existed as a fraternal body 100 years ago comes to mind though. I'd have to look up their name but I have some of their published material.
