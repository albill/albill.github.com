Can anyone name any English or America esoteric societies, secret
societies or interesting fraternal orders that have not been well
studied academically? I'm looking at various posibilities around a
masters thesis topic regarding either history, religious studies or the
like and this is one of my areas of interest. I can think of a number of
groups but I may be missing or forgetting some. Obviously, the OTO is on
the short list but since I'm a member I'm not likely to deconstruct its
mythos, ritual work, etc. for the purposes of a MA thesis. The American
tantrik order that existed as a fraternal body 100 years ago comes to
mind though. I'd have to look up their name but I have some of their
published material.
