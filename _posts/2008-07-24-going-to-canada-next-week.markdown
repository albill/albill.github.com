I am currently preparing, in the most loose of senses, for going to
Canada on Monday. Mozilla does a
[summit](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Summit2008) every couple of years,
which brings in members of the overall Mozilla Community together. The
event for 2008, now that Firefox 3 is out the door, is taking place next
week at Whistler in British Columbia. Whistler is well known, especially
in my hometown of Seattle, as a ski resort (which you don't normally
visit in July and August). (As an aside, it turns out that Americans
need their passports to go to Canada now, which is awfully strange
having grown up crossing the border all the time without them...) All of
us working for the Mozilla Corporation and the recent Mozilla Messaging
company will be attending this event. We're leaving to the event on
Monday morning and coming back on Friday. You can see a [proposed list
of sessions](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Summit2008/Sessions/Schedule)
online. I haven't figured out which sessions I am going to yet but I
expect to try to make the ones on the foundation, open source
philosophy, and perhaps the ones on the [Mozilla
Labs](http://labs.mozilla.com/) projects, like
[Weave](http://labs.mozilla.com/projects/weave/) and Ubiquity. While I'm
at the summit, I'll probably be less available online than my normal
ubiquitousness but I expect that I'll be blogging. After I come back,
I'll only be in town for the weekend and Monday before I fly out of town
for Las Vegas. I'll be attending the Black Hat and DEFCON security
conferences there through the weekend. I'm hoping to see a few friendly
faces at each of these.
