I went to Home Depot and bought a sump pump to replace the one that melted itself to slag (and the cables attached to it) during the last rainy season. I was informed that anything that restricts water flow is "bad" and is probably the reason for the melting behavior. I bought 30 feet of 1 1/2" flexible PVC piping to go with it. Turns out that I need 15 feet more. When I have these, I'll be able to reach the street, which is really where water should go rather than the middle of my back yard when leaving the pump... (For those that don't know, some genius who owned my house buried pipe that drains the water from three of my gutter spouts to a sump pit near the decommissioned pool in the back yard.Â  The problem is that the pump then pump the water to a random spot about 15 feet away, which is as far as the loose hose from it stretched...) I'll probably use the pump to finish draining what is left of the pool. At least when the rain comes, I know my back yard should be fine. Installing the whole thing went relatively well also.

Only one other coworker was present and we attempted to talk about non-computer topics. I think we mostly succeeded. I did walk into one of those conversations that no man should when I wandered by a group of the female guests.

I just listened to the interview with Alastair Reynolds, one of my favorite writers from the U.K. I downloaded the China Mieville one, which is what I was sent to the site to get.

I recently picked up (actually, I imported it from England) his new novel, <b> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743256700/">River of Gods</a></b>, and it is going to be one of the next things I read. I'm quite fond of his <i> Chaga</i> stories. River of Gods is one of the few science fiction novels set in India which, as Ian points out in the column above, is amazingly ignored for a functioning democracy with a billion people that speak English...
