You can see their page for <a href="http://www.patheos.com/Find/Religion-and-Faith-Book-Club.html">Religion and Faith Book Club</a> and they <a href="http://www.patheos.com/About-Patheos/Press-Room/In-the-News/Patheos-Book-Club.html">posted a press release</a> about it this weekend.

Of immediate relevance to some Buddhists is that they've just started their first book with Deepak Chopra's "<a href="http://www.patheos.com/community/takeandread/2010/09/13/buddha-a-story-of-enlightenment-by-deepak-chopra">Buddha: A Story of Enlightenment</a>." They've posted <a href="http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Discussion-Questions-on-Buddha-A-Story-of-Enlightenment.html">discussion questions</a> and are <a href="http://www.patheos.com/community/groups/buddha-book-club/">hosting online discussions</a> for the book. As part of this book club, Patheos and the publisher are making ebook versions of Chopra's book <a href="http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Buy-Deepak-Chopras-Buddha.html">available for free</a> for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Buddha-With-Bonus-Material-ebook/dp/B003YCOOM6">Kindle</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/books/product.aspx?EAN=9780062062635">Nook</a>, and the iBookstore from Apple. 

For those interested in an online discussion of the book or new to Buddhism, this is a nice opportunity. I've read Chopra's book and found it to be a decent introduction to the Buddha without much in the way of polemic. <br clear="all">
