[Patheos](http://www.patheos.com), an interfaith web site, is now
running book clubs as part of their site. You can see their page for
[Religion and Faith Book
Club](http://www.patheos.com/Find/Religion-and-Faith-Book-Club.html) and
they [posted a press
release](http://www.patheos.com/About-Patheos/Press-Room/In-the-News/Patheos-Book-Club.html)
about it this weekend. Of immediate relevance to some Buddhists is that
they've just started their first book with Deepak Chopra's "[Buddha: A
Story of
Enlightenment](http://www.patheos.com/community/takeandread/2010/09/13/buddha-a-story-of-enlightenment-by-deepak-chopra)."
They've posted [discussion
questions](http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Discussion-Questions-on-Buddha-A-Story-of-Enlightenment.html)
and are [hosting online
discussions](http://www.patheos.com/community/groups/buddha-book-club/)
for the book. As part of this book club, Patheos and the publisher are
making ebook versions of Chopra's book [available for
free](http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Buy-Deepak-Chopras-Buddha.html)
for the
[Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/Buddha-With-Bonus-Material-ebook/dp/B003YCOOM6),
[Nook](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/books/product.aspx?EAN=9780062062635),
and the iBookstore from Apple. For those interested in an online
discussion of the book or new to Buddhism, this is a nice opportunity.
I've read Chopra's book and found it to be a decent introduction to the
Buddha without much in the way of polemic. \
