News about those fuckers in the management of
[Powell's](http://www.powells.com). From a local e-mail list:

> FYI for those of you who shop at Powell's you might want to send them
> an email letting them know that you support worker's rights.
> -----Forwarded Message----- From: ILWUOrganize@aol.com To:
> ILWUOrganize@aol.com Subject: Support Powell's book store workers
> Date: 26 Nov 2003 15:38:27 -0500 Dear Sisters and Brohers, he more
> than 400 workers at Powell's book store, the nation's largest
> independent book store, are proud members of Local 5 of the
> International Longshore & Warehouse Union (ILWU). Several years ago
> they went through a protracted, bitter struggle to win their first
> union contract. Now, despite the store being owned by a
> self-proclaimed "liberal" who support union rights for workers as long
> as they're not HIS employees, is stonewalling. The contract expired
> two months ago. During that time, management has harassed and
> discriminated against union activists and leaders. Management has also
> put forward contract proposals which would provide minimal raises,
> hugely offset by cuts in medical benefits that far exceed the meager
> pay increases. Management claimed that they would have a new proposal
> this week, stalling on meeting with the workers as the holiday week
> approached. But yesterday (Tuesday 11/25) management showed up with
> nothing new. Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, is the busiest
> shopping day of the year. Powell's workers will stage a one-day unfair
> labor practices strike to protest the harassment of their leadership.
> This is a key labor struggle for the entire Northwest, as well as for
> the efforts to improve working conditions in non-food retail. Please
> join us if you possibly can to send a clear message to Michael Powell
> and the book store's management team: stop breaking the law - stop
> violating workers' rights! Friday, November 28th 9:00 am - 9:00 pm
> Powell's City of Books 1005 W Burnside, Portland Please remember: this
> is an unfair labor practices strike. Please bring signs, jackets and
> caps from your union or organization - but please make sure the signs
> refer to "unfair labor practices" and "workers' rights," not to any
> contract issue. For updated information on the contract struggle,
> please call Local 5 at 503-228-5047. New information will be posted on
> the voice message by Thanksgiving day. If you are going to the picket
> line from the Puget Sound, and need transportation or have room for
> riders, please drop me a note, and I'll do my best to coordinate rides
> and riders. Thanks for your support. In solidarity, Paul Bigman ILWU
> International Organizer
