The OSOGD has updated their site again at <a href="http://www.osogd.org">http://www.osogd.org</a>. They've added their Zelator ritual, another knowledge lecture, more of their own internal essays/thoughts and a number of Sam Webster's materials that I also have up at <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/webster/">http://www.hermetic.com/webster/</a>.

Good stuff.
