There is a War on Solstice.
The nature of the conflict is detailed at:

"Historians generally agree that the Cult of Christ started the War on Solstice. They began by coopting the symbols of this most ancient of celebrations: holly, evergreen trees and the Yule log. Those cultists even <a href="http://www.ucg.org/booklets/JC/prophecy_jesusborn.htm">moved the date</a> of their god's birth from summer to winter! Moreover, they outright plagarized the story of how the greek god Dionysus was born in a cave in the presence of three shepherds."
