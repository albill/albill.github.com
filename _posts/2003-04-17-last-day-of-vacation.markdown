Today was the last day of my vacation. This was my "jet lag recovery"
day. It turns out that I'm not too lagged overall, which is good. R and
I went downtown today and I replaced my three year old Doc Marten's with
brand new ones that look almost entirely the same! Woo! I caught up on
e-mail and LJ and then met for coffee and gave him some trinkets from
Greece. We hung out for a couple of hours and spoke about this and that.
Tomorrow I go back to work and back on my normal diet, which is
Atkins-based. I think I gained about ten pounds while in Greece from the
food we ate there and I'm looking forward to getting back to normal and
losing the weight. I also go back to Latin class tomorrow. I've missed 2
1/2 weeks of the term so I'm woefully behind. I'm hoping to be up to
speed in the next few weeks but it is going to be a tough slog, I can
tell. That's about it. I'll be posting Greece pictures soon but I
haven't pulled them off of my camera yet.
