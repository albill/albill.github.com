Today was the last day of my vacation. This was my "jet lag recovery" day. It turns out that I&apos;m not too lagged overall, which is good.

R and I went downtown today and I replaced my three year old Doc Marten&apos;s with brand new ones that look almost entirely the same! Woo!

I caught up on e-mail and LJ and then met  for coffee and gave him some trinkets from Greece. We hung out for a couple of hours and spoke about this and that.

Tomorrow I go back to work and back on my normal diet, which is Atkins-based. I think I gained about ten pounds while in Greece from the food we ate there and I&apos;m looking forward to getting back to normal and losing the weight.

I also go back to Latin class tomorrow. I&apos;ve missed 2 1/2 weeks of the term so I&apos;m woefully behind. I&apos;m hoping to be up to speed in the next few weeks but it is going to be a tough slog, I can tell.

That&apos;s about it. I&apos;ll be posting Greece pictures soon but I haven&apos;t pulled them off of my camera yet.
