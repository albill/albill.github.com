I've got the luxury of two days off from work this week for free. Microsoft has a rather large campus (is there a company with larger?) and I'm on a secondary campus. They're moving my entire group (60+ people) back onto main campus this week so we get Thursday and Friday off to keep us out of their hair while they move all of our machines and boxed up stuff. I can't complain about a three day work week. Next week is one as well because of the fourth of july and then I'm going to California for a week the following week on Thursday for the recreation of the Rites of Eleusis that I'm attending.

What bad things can you say about three three-day work weeks in a row other than me possibly getting stressed about schedule since I'm a manager type?

Since we're moving, I decided to take advantage of it and paint my new office. This might seem weird but how many years can anyone work in an institutional off-white office and not go insane? A number of us do this on occasion and our facilities people only go ape-shit about it infrequently. I found a half-full can of a decent blue left over from some painting project in a lounge, bought a roller and such and did my best job on three out of four walls in my new window office. The edges aren't the best and they'll have to do some replacement on plastic trim when I leave but... heh. It looks a hell of a lot better and the fumes will get me high for months.

R and I are looking to find a house in Seattle or just north of there though the Eastside is a possibility since I'm finally getting sick of the commute after doing it since 1995. We're resigned to moving off of the Hill since we don't want to pay more than $1,500 a month and need a minimum of a three bedroom house (1 room for me, 1 room for her, 1 shared bedroom) in order to stay sane. I did a big net trawl of classifieds tonight and found a lot of three bedroom places and some four bedroom places in Bothell, Kirkland, Redmond, Beacon Hill and a few scattered places. Now we have to start making calls. Having two cats and a ferret will make it interesting too...
