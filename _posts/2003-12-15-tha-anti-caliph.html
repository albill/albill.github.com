No, not an OTO essay! An old article by Peter Lamborn Wilson (aka Hakim Bey) that I had a photocopy of from over a decade ago. It's a lecture he gave.

<strong>THE ANTI-CALIPH</strong>
<strong>Ibn 'Arabi, Inner Wisdom, and the Heretic Tradition</strong>

<em>by Peter Lamborn Wilson</em>

and Khezr, the Hidden Prophet, the Green Man, King of Hyperborea, wily  servant of Moses, trickster-cook of Alexander, Khezr who drank from the fountain  of life in the Land of Darkness. Flowers and herbs spring trp in his footsteps,  and he strolls across the water, walking toward Ibn 'Arabi's ship, coming  closer; his green robe trailing on green waves - or perhaps woven of waves. Or  Khezr appears in the desert with water and initiation for the masterless ones,  the mad and blameworthy, the unique ones... `And three things of this life are worthy of the glance: water, green things, and a beautiful face...'

and the Hidden Imam who vanished into a cave, perhaps in Samarra, perhaps in  Yemen, who lives beyond the Isthmus of Similitudes in the midst of the sea of  Images, on an island all of emerald, with trees of' emerald and flowers of green  beryl, palaces of jasper and jade - the young man dressed in black, who appears  in dreams to alchemists, who initiates in dreams...

and Ovays al-Qarani, hermit of the Yemen who met the Prophet - but only in  dreams - who upheld the Household of All - who appears to the masterless ones in  dreams and initiates them into the Order of the Ovaysiyya.
<h3 style="text-align: center">II. The Silsilah</h3>
Sohrawardi al Magtul, who was executed for heresy, established for himself a  silsilah or Initiatic Chain, consisting of teachers whom he met in visions or  dreams - that is, in the Imaginal Realm. Here then follows a list in no  particular order, of names each of which constitutes a link in such a chain -  Imaginal or imaginary...

Mansur ibn al-Hallaj, executed for heresy, for preaching 'I am the Truth',  defender of Satan as `the perfect lover and unitarian', supporter of the  Zinjarite Black Slave Rebellion, condemned to the gibbet on a warrant signed by  his own sufi master;

Hafez Shirazi, who recommended that we `stain our prayercarpets with wine';

Mahmud Shabistari, who said, `If moslems really understood Islam, they would be idol-worshippers';

Ahmad Ghazzali, Fakhroddin Iraqi and Awhadoddin Kermani, the three poets of  Witness Play or 'contemplation of the Beardless';

Shaykh Husayn Kashefi, nay patron alchemist-saint of Herat;

Lal Shabazz Qalandar, the `Red Hawk' of Sindh, shaykh of the Lawless  dervishes and hasheesheen;

Hassan-i Sabbah, the Old Man of the Mountain of Alamut, founder of the  Assassins; and his descendant Hassan II 'On Whose Mention Be Peace', who declared that 'the Chains of the Law have been broken';

the Egyptian Fatimid 'Anti-Caliph' Hakim, who wrote treatises on alchemy and  ordered that day be turned to night and night to day in Cairo, who vanished into  the desert;

Sunan Kalidjaga, who brought esoteric Islam to Java and invented the Wayang  Kulit Shadow Puppet play, based on the Hindu epics;

Mushtaq Ali Shah the mad musician, who was stoned to death in Kerman for  playing the call to Prayer on his sehtar;

Mohiyoddin Ibn 'Arabi, initiated by Khezr, chased out of Cairo for writing  love poems to a fourteen-year-old girl, founder of the School of the Oneness of  Being.

By invoking each of these figures to bestow a particular <em>baraka </em>on the  present undertaking, enough will have been said to those who are familiar with  their names, that what follows will be almost superfluous. One meets these  shaykhs by pilgrimages to their tombs, or to their books (for cenotaphs and  divans are both square dead objects which may seem to hold living spirits) - or  in visions, or dreams - and virtually everything we might say here is already  swallowed up by their presence.

'Catastrophe Theory' in science deals with sudden and drastic changes in some  feature of a system, such as the earth's crust, or human society. In  popular usage the word catastrophe has 'bad' connotations, but some sudden changes may well be experienced as positive. Revelation itself might be called a  catastrophe. Mystical insight or Wisdom <em>(hikmah) </em>can also work catastrophically on the system known as human consciousness.

Scholars generally limit themselves to descriptions of change while mystics and poets prefer to participate in or even to precipitate catastrophes of  consciousness. What follows can be classified neither as scholarship nor  mystical poetry; it is rather a prolegomena to a study of certain catastrophic potentialities in the teachings of Ibn 'Arabi and the heretical tradition. Here we are concerned neither with facts nor with poetry <em>per se, </em>but with <em> poetic facts - </em>bits of information which, at a certain density, may cause a sudden breakthrough or catastrophic breakdown of the border between ordinary consciousness and the <em>alam-i khyyal </em>or World of Imagination.

What follows is almost more <em>story </em>than scholarly text - the idea of `fiction' will help provide an appropriate bezel for our shadowy confusion, hyperbole and rhetoric, palpable orientalismo, scandalous and unfounded assertions. This text may push itself toward the edge of discourse, in danger of a Humpty-Dumpty-like crash into totally arbitrary semantics (`words mean what I want them to mean!'). As one of the Persian poets (Salman Savaji) said:

Who does not know my bad reputation? like a bath-tub fallen off the roof!
<h3>III. Ibn 'Arabi and the Heretics</h3>
In the long and beautiful introduction to his <em>Creative Imagination in the Sufism of Ibn 'Arabi, </em>the late Henry Corbin summarized, in effect, an idiosyncratic philosophy of `Oriental Wisdom' which illuminated all his writing. This essay presents itself as rooted in a tradition: Corbin mentions all his favourite figures (many of the same listed in the 'silsilah' of the present text as well). Corbin's essay focusses on certain events in the biography of the Shaykh al-Akbar, but Corbin's sub-text is in fact his own spiritual autobiography. As he says, he has <em>lived </em>certain events, temporal and a- temporal, historical and spiritual. The <em>ta'vil </em>in this context serves as more than a tool of the intellect or even of the Imagination: like a bathysphere, it offers to plunge the entire self, body included, into the depths - a Catastrophe Machine!

One of these events, Ibn 'Arabi's birthday, provokes in Corbin an indulgence <strong>in </strong>sheer occult synchronicity, the celebration of a coincidence which assumed for him an archetypal importance. According to the lunar calendar, this birthday (17 Ramazan 560/July 28, 1165) marked the first anniversary of the proclamation of the Great Resurrection at Alamut (17 Ramazan 559/August 8, 1164). Corbin's exquisite hagiography invites us to meditate on this double anniversary, this holiday, but does not stop to explain <em>why. </em>A clue has been offered, or perhaps one of Corbin's obsessions has briefly and rather mysteriously surfaced. What was the Great Resurrection and what connection might it have with lbn 'Arabi beside a happenstance of dating?

Corbin himself had plenty to say on the subject in other books, which cannot be too highly recommended. Here however a somewhat different slant is proposed, one based on the literal significance of the Great Resurrection of <em>Ruz-i Qiyamat. </em>In brief, Hassan 11, the Ismaili Pir of Alamut, proclaimed on this day a general esoteric abrogation of the Shariah. The veil of dissimulation <em> (tagiyya) </em>was lifted from the letter of the Law, and its outer form was shattered. 'The Chains of the Law have been broken.' The uncovering of the inner meaning of Revelation results in <em>a benign reversal </em>of its outward symbolism; those who participate in this gnosis are freed from both the, literal meaning and the legal stipulations of organized religion. In both senses of the word they have <em>broken the code. </em>The Ismailis (or 'Assassins') of Alamut signalled this general amnesty from the tyranny of Exoteric Authority by drinking wine for lunch in the middle of Ramazan: thus they broke their Fast forever.

Outward Islam must of necessity view the Qiyamat as antinomian, heretical and revolutionary - and indeed it did so, with good reason. No doubt, as Corbin emphasizes, Ismailism was primarily <em>gnosis, </em>Oriental Wisdom - but it also acted with overt militancy and stealthy terror to propagandize itself. In Islamdom, where politics and religion form parts of a seamless life and culture, 'heresy' works as both critique and polemic, as discourse and as war. Heresy speaks the same language as its surrounding culture but insists that certain words possess a catastrophic significance: hidden meanings capable of transforming an entire world suddenly from within itself, like a self-resurrecting phoenix.

The Qiyamat, then, represents a radical break with institutional, ritual and traditional Islam - a rupture which cannot be attributed to lbn 'Arabi. His autobiographical writings bear witness to a classical sufi intention to <em> intensify </em>the ritual aspect of Islam as part of his practical path. Nevertheless, the hyper-orthodox have always looked on the Shaykh as somehow <em> risky, </em>if not downright suspect.

For example, while living in Egypt he published his <em>Interpreter of Desires, a </em>book of poems celebrating his love for a young girl he met while circumambulating the Kaaba in Mecca. The local ulema smelled blasphemy; lbn 'Arabi hastily removed himself to Syria - and we can thank the outraged mullahs for inspiring his next work, the <em>Interpreter of the Interpreter, </em>in which he defends his erotic-mystical ambiguities with dazzling scholasticism. Centuries later (a few years ago) Ibn 'Arabi was again in trouble in Egypt: the Muslim Brotherhood and other reactionaries inspired a law banning publication of his M<em>eccan Revelations. </em>And scholars like Fazlur Rahman still blame him for the ruination of orthodox sufism.

Ibn 'Arabi's continental mass, so to speak, covers too much territory to fit on any single map. His writings have been used to bolster up the most impeccably orthodox mysticism - as in the North African sufi orders, for example - as well as many other types of Islamic esotericism, some not so orthodox. Treatises such as the <em>R. al-ahadiyya </em>(on the hadith 'Whoso knoweth his Lord'), which present a pure and radical monism, might well serve the outlaw purposes of Ismaili metaphysicians. Indeed, Corbin shows that Ismailis did make such use of Ibn 'Arabi's teachings on <em>ta'vil, </em>the Perfect Man, the Oneness of Being, etc. The Nizaris of Alamut experienced the Great Resurrection as an historical moment and as a mythic or Imaginal Archetype; what Ibn 'Arabi gave them was a new vocabulary with which to expand their exegesis of the Qiyamat and its radical ramifications.

"I o the Persian poets the Shaykh bequeathed still another map, one which begins its cartomantic project with texts like <em>The Interpreter of Desires, </em>and the 28th chapter of the <em>Fusus al-hikam </em>(on the hadith "Three things of this world are made worthy of love to tile: women, perfume and prayer'). Here Love is declared the equivalent or perhaps superior of religion; the human beloved becomes a Witness <em>(shahed), </em>a Theophany of the Real. Again, the poets received from Ibn 'Arabi a language of discourse with which to expand their comprehension of a complex already central to their very being: <em> eros, </em>desire, and the borderland between erotic and mystical consciousness.

Out of such speculation arose a spiritual practice, the `Witness Game', which uses Imaginal Yoga to transmute erotic desire <em>into </em>spiritual consciousness. The means include poetic and musical improvisation, dance, and `gazing' chastely at beautiful boys (whence the practice was also known as 'Contemplation of the <em>heartless'),</em>

This teaching was perfected in the centuries after Ibn 'Arabi's death by a series of gifted poets closely associated with his School - Fakhroddin Iraqi, Awhadoddin Kermani and Abdul Rahman Jami, to name three of the best-known. Without specific reference to the Witness Game, other poets such as Mahmud Shabistari and Shah Nematollah Vali synthesized Ibn 'Arabi's metaphysics with a general poetic and romantic symbolism. All this together constitutes what can be called a Persian 'School of Love' within the general context of a School of <em>
wahdat al-wujud.</em>

Needless to say, although the poets of the Witness Game followed the letter of the Shariah and its sexual code, their dangerous game of Sublimation was condemned as rank heresy by such as Ibn Taymiyya, who complained, `They kiss a slave boy and claim to have seen God!' However orthodox (or not) the sufis might have been in their private lives, their poetry has given much aid and comfort to `real heretics' like the Ismailis, who would of course take quite literally such lines as Iraqi's:

Forget the Kaaba:

The vintner's gates are open!

Despite the protests of scholars like lvanov and even Corbin, the later (post-Alamut) lsmailis did not adopt Persian <em>dervishi </em>sufism simply as a mask. They <em>incorporated </em>such poets as Shabastari and Shah Nematollah
wholesale into their grand synthesis, just as they did with Ibn 'Arabi's more austere metaphysics.
