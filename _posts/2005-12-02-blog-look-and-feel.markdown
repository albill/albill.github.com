I did a bit more tweaking with the template and the images tonight. The blog looks a lot more as I typically like it. I had to start messing with the CSS and create new banners and such.

I have to see if there is an amazon plugin for Wordpress. I must say that, overall, I'm like Wordpress more than I did Movable Type.
