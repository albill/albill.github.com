Tomorrow is the secon of the series of three "Neo-Tantra" type classes R and I are doing. Hopefully we'll get past pranayama and chakras. I'm glad we're doing this as it is fairly interesting. I'm not sure how it relates to ritual work for me but we'll see.

R and I have begun planning on how to go about practicing the Gnostic Mass in our home temple space as well. We've volunteered to be children in the rite in the near future and we'd both like to learn the Priest and Priestess roles (one each, not both each) for doing the ritual on occasions as well. I have an interest in mass type rituals and I would welcome good recommendations on books in that space or mass types rituals that people have written. I just read the one done by Nema for her Maat book last night and that was a little....<em>different</em>....than most of them.

I'm still a bit pissed that the MA program at Naropa has been delayed a year. I'd finally committed myself to trying to get in. Now I feel like I don't really have any options for getting an MA unless I want to do a night program locally in Computer Science, Information Studies or Business. While the first two have some interest given my career path, they don't excite me really. I'd like to study classical philosophy, religious movements, mystical experiences or fraternal orders....

Oh, on the last note, I'll be applying to join the Freemasons soon. It's something I've thought about doing for a long time so it's about time to do it. A number of the local OTO brethren are members of a couple of lodges and it should be interesting. After the Odd Fellows, I'm not sure how many real surprises are in store for me.
