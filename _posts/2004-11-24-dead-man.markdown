<p>R and I watched <b>Dead Man</b> this evening, starring Johnny Depp and with a 
cast of notable side characters (including Iggy Pop in a bonnet and a dress). 
I&#39;d missed seeing this, somehow, over the years. I liked it quite a bit though 
the pacing was very slow in a way. Definitely worth watching though.</p>
<p>Last night, I went to a dinner with my immediate peers from work and our 
boss. There are four of us who work closely together as peers under our boss. 
This was a dinner to get us together in a more relaxed environment to discuss 
work issues and otherwise think about problems. Because of a snafu the other 
week, most of us also went out to dinner two weeks ago. Combining this with my 
trip to LA last week (with my boss and another coworker) and I think I&#39;m pretty 
talked out when it comes to spending lots of quality time with coworkers. This 
isn&#39;t to speak ill of anyone. By and large, I like my coworkers and my boss 
isn&#39;t always a hardcase but, as an introvert almost-only child, I get tired of 
having to talk to people on demand and it can be very draining. I tend to like 
to do things on my own timing, schedule or terms. Being in management doesn&#39;t 
really allow for this a lot of the time so I get to work outside my comfort 
zone. This long weekend away from everyone will be a good chance to unwind from 
everything.</p>
<p>Turkey Day will be at Tylik&#39;s house, as normal for us. I&#39;m bringing the 
mashed taters. Food should be good and I haven&#39;t seen her or the others there in 
a fair bit (not counting my wedding). Saturday is Wiccan Inmate Day at McNeil 
Island so I&#39;ll be spending some time with the boys there. It should be fairly 
good. I&#39;d like to get a chance to see <b>Alexander</b> in the next few days as 
well.</p>
<p>Also, I signed up for my first courses in my Master&#39;s program today. <b>Woo-hoo!</b> 
They are graduate level History (or Theory of History) and Philosophy classes. 
These will start up in early January. I&#39;m looking forward to the program even if 
it will be quite a bit of work over the next couple of years. Maybe when I&#39;m 
done I&#39;ll be ready to write those few books that my friends have been 
encouraging me to do for a while. We&#39;ll see.</p>
