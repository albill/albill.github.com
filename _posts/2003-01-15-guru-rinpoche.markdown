I'm going to the Wrathful Guru Rinpoche empowerment in a couple of hours
at Chagdud Gonpa Amrita. I've been looking forward to this.

> *Now, in the pure depth of the heavens, Vajrasattva, allowing the
> Metamorphic Body to be seen, seared upon an elephant, holding a golden
> vajra to his heart with his right hand, and with his left hand holding
> a silver bell at his side, crowned with the ornaments of the Five
> Transcendent Buddhas, his body covered with all the perfect ornaments,
> decorated with bones at the shoulders, at the wrists, and at the
> ankles, brilliant with the white glitter of crystal. Perfectly learned
> in the Mahayoga, Vajrasattva reveals as a dwelling the celestial
> palace of the three Baskets, reveals as gods and goddesses the whole
> internal essence, reveals as Mantra the entire murmur of the words,
> reveals as enchantments everything which is of body, speech, and mind.
> And he sets forth the Tantras of the Mahayoga, which are, according to
> the whole classification, five hundred thousand, and the whole of
> which forms the eighteen root Tantras.*
