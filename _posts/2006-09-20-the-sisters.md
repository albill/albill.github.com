My blessed wife was once one of the few female members of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a queer organization composed largely of gay men. Earlier today, she posted a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rerlin/sets/72157594291961420/">photo set</a> from her old albums including the photo below.

<em>R is on the right here...</em>



But wait...there's more! It isn't just my wife. The wonderful Rubylou is also a former sister from the same era. I have the following old pic of her as well.

How I, one of the most mundane straight men in the world, wound up dating <strong>two</strong> different queer girls who had been in the Sisters, I will never understand. I guess I attract the freaky ones. :-)
