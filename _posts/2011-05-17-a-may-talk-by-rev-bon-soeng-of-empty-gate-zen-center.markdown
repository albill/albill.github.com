[Empty Gate Zen Center](http://emptygatezen.com/) is my local instance
of the [Kwan Um School of Zen](http://www.kwanumzen.org/). The lineage
that I practice in is ultimately the same as theirs as we are all
students of Zen Master Seung Sahn, who founded that school and who died
a few years back. Empty Gate has sitting available just about every day
but on Wednesday nights, their abbot, Rev. Bon Soeng, gives Dharma
talks. In a rare embrace of the 21st century, they actually stream these
talks live and often make them available afterwards. Below is Rev. Bon
Soeng's talk from May 11, last Wednesday. I've been listening to it and
found it to be quite good and definitely in line with how we approach
things in the Five Mountain Sangha as well. I recommend listening to it
if you have the time and inclination. You can hear it on
[ustream](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/14642305) or watch it below if
you have flash installed and enabled.
