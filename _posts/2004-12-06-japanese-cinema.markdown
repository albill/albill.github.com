R and I watched <strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364385/">Ju-On: The Grudge</a></strong> tonight. We had rented it and <strong>Ultraviolet</strong>, a short-live British show about a clandestine organization fighting vampires, from Scarecrow Video. We picked up a new progressive scan, region free DVD player too. My Apex, able to be hacked for any region, had finally given up the ghost after having served me well since 1998 or so. Given the foreign DVDs that we have, we had to have something. An early Christmas gift. As far as <strong>Ju-On</strong> goes, it definitely was a bit creepy but, overall, it was less than satisfying. The creepiness never ballooned into full squick-me terror and kind of got repetitive. I must confess as a literal American (or something), the non-linear Japanese plot and its timeline left me wondering "WTF?" at points. Not a bad movie but <strong>Ringu</strong> was much more interesting. <strong>Ju-On</strong> is still better than a number of bad Japanese movies (<strong>The Returner</strong> comes to mind) though. For downright Japanese fun, I still recommend <strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266308/">Battle Royale</a></strong> the most. There is nothing like watching Japanese schoolgirls in uniform wielding automatic weapons on their peers. Hmm...I don't sound very Buddhist today, do I? <p align="left">

I started reading <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575076135/">Stamping Butterflies</a></strong> by Jon Grimwood instead. I'm actually finding that one fairly gripping but Grimwood is in my top five British authors and I tend to love his work. This one is outside of any series and is a lot of fun.
