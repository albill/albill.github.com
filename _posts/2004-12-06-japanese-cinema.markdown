R and I watched **[Ju-On: The
Grudge](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364385/)** tonight. We had rented
it and **Ultraviolet**, a short-live British show about a clandestine
organization fighting vampires, from Scarecrow Video. We picked up a new
progressive scan, region free DVD player too. My Apex, able to be hacked
for any region, had finally given up the ghost after having served me
well since 1998 or so. Given the foreign DVDs that we have, we had to
have something. An early Christmas gift. As far as **Ju-On** goes, it
definitely was a bit creepy but, overall, it was less than satisfying.
The creepiness never ballooned into full squick-me terror and kind of
got repetitive. I must confess as a literal American (or something), the
non-linear Japanese plot and its timeline left me wondering "WTF?" at
points. Not a bad movie but **Ringu** was much more interesting.
**Ju-On** is still better than a number of bad Japanese movies (**The
Returner** comes to mind) though. For downright Japanese fun, I still
recommend **[Battle Royale](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266308/)** the
most. There is nothing like watching Japanese schoolgirls in uniform
wielding automatic weapons on their peers. Hmm...I don't sound very
Buddhist today, do I?

I put down Neal Stephenson for a little while as I just wasn't feeling
super engaged by it. I started reading **[Stamping
Butterflies](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575076135/)** by
Jon Grimwood instead. I'm actually finding that one fairly gripping but
Grimwood is in my top five British authors and I tend to love his work.
This one is outside of any series and is a lot of fun.
