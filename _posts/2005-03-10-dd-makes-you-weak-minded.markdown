From <a href="http://www.boingboing.net">BoingBoing Blog</a>:
<strong>Israeli Army thinks D&amp;D players are weak-minded security risks</strong>

<strong>Cory Doctorow</strong>: The Israeli Army won't let you work in a sensitive position if you play Dungeons and Dragons: 
<blockquote>IDF does not approve of this unusual hobby and prevents D&amp;D players from being considered for sensitive army positions by labeling them with low security clearance. 

"We have discovered that some of them are simply detached from reality," a security source told Ynet. 

Game enthusiasts are aware of their problematic image in the army and prefer to maintain their anonymity. Many of them are from the former Soviet Union, where the game is very popular... 

"These people have a tendency to be influenced by external factors which could cloud their judgment, a military official says. "They may be detached from reality or have a weak personality - elements which lower a person's security clearance, allowing them to serve in the army, but not in sensitive positions."</blockquote>
