<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ioerror/2900128362/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3181/2900128362_90eff2a856.jpg" width="500" height="375" border="1"></p>I've <a href="/2008/07/05/noisebridge-progress/">blogged before</a> about <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/index.php/NoiseBridge">Noisebridge</a>, the hacker collective in San Francisco (or the Bay Area as a whole, really) of which I am a member. The group has been meeting once a week for coffee for most of a year now and has been looking for an affordable space for most of that time.

The vision of the group is:
<blockquote>"We want to provide infrastructure and collaboration opportunities for people interested in programming, hardware hacking, physics, chemistry, mathematics, photography, security, robotics, all kinds of art, and, of course, technology. Through talks, workshops, and projects we encourage knowledge exchange, learning, and mentoring.

As a space for artistic collaboration and experimentation, we are open to all types of art - with a special emphasis on the crossover of art and technology. From hardware labs to electronics, cooking, photography, and sound labs, anything that's creative is welcome.

We intend to have many interesting things happening at all times. Sharing is essential to making this work. A logical followup to this is to find a space to display our creative projects. "</blockquote>

As of today, we finally have our own space, keys in hand and lease signed. It is just off of 16th and Mission in San Francisco (at 83C Wiese St between Mission and Valencia just off 16th). We signed papers today after collecting promised funds from people over the last week once it became clear that the space would work and that the will of the collective was that we should get it.

Right now, there is literally nothing in the space and it needs to be cleaned. We're going to hold our first meeting in it tomorrow, Tuesday the 30th, at 8:00 PM. Jacob Appelbaum seems attached to calling the <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/index.php/The_Space">space</a>, "Noisebridge Meadows." It consists of a 20' by 30' room with a kitchen and bathroom, a small "board room" with doors, and a 15' by 30' loft area above overlooking the main room. You can see shots of it from the initial showing last week on endenizen's <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/endenizen/sets/72157607542165545/">flickr set</a> for it. It doesn't look like much yet but it is ours!

Priorities now will be to get it cleaned up, networking and wiring set up or improved, and connectivity added. We should be meeting in the space every Tuesday evening, at minimum, and probably doing some other events or classes there in the short term  (my wife suggests a "cock fighting" night as a monthly rent party).

We're still in the middle of the process of incorporating as a non-profit but this is almost done and will make fund raising and contributions a lot easier.

This has been a long time in coming, especially for some of the much earlier members than me. I'm really looking forward to watching the space and group develop.
