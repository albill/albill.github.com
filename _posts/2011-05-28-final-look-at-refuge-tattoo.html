I had Buddhist refuge vows done in Sanskrit using the script commonly called "Siddham" here in the West. You see this a lot for mantras and other Sanskrit text in Japan and Korea (and I presume China, at least at some point). The vows go: <blockquote>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              बुद्धं शरणं गच्छामि। धम्मं शरणं गच्छामि। संघं शरणं गच्छामि। Buddhaṃ śaraṇaṃ gacchāmi. Dharmaṃ śaraṇaṃ gacchāmi. Saṃghaṃ śaraṇaṃ gacchāmi. I take refuge in the Buddha. I take refuge in the Dharma. I take refuge in the Sangha.

We actually went over both the black and the red

This is what it initially looked like before the red work the day it was done before it healed: <p style="text-align: center">

I take them as a reminder of my vows and my path as a Buddhist, engraved on my flesh.
