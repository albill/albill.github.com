R and I are just back in the last few hours from our whirlwind tour of Portland, Oregon (again).

We picked up and her "friend" and headed down there <em>early</em> yesterday morning. I had to get there before noon for my second degree OTO initiation. We arrived on time and I took the initiation in a timely manner. Later on in the evening, there were also some first degree initiations that I was there for as well.

My mom and her boyfriend, Bill, attended my Second and it was kind of cool to have her there. I don't think we've been in a ritual space together for about ten years now. Apparantly, she resisted the urge to straighten my ritual regalia. ;-)

R and I got to spend the night at K's place (which she shares with and G) afterwards. We also got a chance to hang out and be social with the great multitudes at Sekhet-Maat Lodge. Gnostica was up visiting from Eugene and was supposed to Priestess the Gnostic Mass today but we didn't have time to stay for it. It's really good to get to see my non-local friends in person and I really like the group down in Portland quite a bit.

In about an hour, I'm grabbing and heading over to the White Manjushri empowerment that I wrote about recently.
