R and I had a relatively quiet weekend at home.

It was good to see Circus Contraption doing their thing and we got to see a bit of burlesque on the "Hell" side as well, which is always fun. Creative use of little plastic disks and all that. We stayed and drank until a bit after midnight and then wandered over to the Hurricane Cafe to gorge ourselves mightily on breakfast food. That was a last hurrah because R and I are both switching our diets over to the "South Beach Diet" which is vaguely similar to Atkins but a bit more sane in that you send to eat a lot of vegetables and high fiber things and keep the protein lean. We need to modify our food intake so I'm back to being on a now-sugar, lower carb thing (bye bye, bread and potatoes!).

I finished Liz Williams' <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159780018X/">Snake Agent</a></b> the other day and read <b><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575076151/">9 Tail Fox</a></b> by Grimwood in the last 30 hours or so. That's enough Chinese gods and spirits for a while, I think. Moving to the West, I will be reading Hal Duncan's <b><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1405052082/">Vellum</a></b> this week, which is his take on angels and the War in Heaven.

I also got <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1403966966/">Cosa Nostra: A History of the Sicilian Mafia</a></b> from the library. This covers, among other things, some of the ritual aspects of the mafia and goes well with the books on the Chinese tongs that I've been reading over the last couple of years. I'm fascinated by secret societies (strangely enough), especially the ones with political or criminal ends (as if there is a difference).

McKirahan, Jr. which I found for $10. For my Greek philosophy graduate class next term, I have to do an original research paper relating to Greek philosophy and I'm considering the pre-Socratics. With my own love of Neoplatonists, which pretty much all date to the Roman era and are not Greek, I have to move outside my comfort zone. The same goes for much of the Stoic thought that I like.
