We just got back from our trip to Seattle. We spent the weekend visiting
friends and I attended the events for the Karmapa while I was there.
I'll be writing more about it later. For now, I will leave people with
these two pictures from inside of
[Travelers](http://www.travelersteaco.com/), a store on Capitol Hill,
run by longtime members of the pagan community. They sell all sorts of
goods from India, for the most part, and relatively recently expanded to
selling a lot of food items. They have always had a beautiful space
though.
