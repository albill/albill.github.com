R and I went to see [Nine Inch
Nails](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Inch_Nails) on their "[Lights
in the Sky](http://tour.nin.com/)" tour last night at the Oracle Arena
in Oakland. It was a phenomenal show. R has been to a lot more concerts
over the last twenty or so years than I have but this one topped any
that either of us have seen for presentation. As science fiction author,
Peter Watts, [reported a month
ago](http://rifters.com/real/2008/08/reznor-and-singularity.html), the
light show that they did with the show was amazing. The engineer in me
wanted to know what it was made out of but they had a screen behind the
band and one that lowered in front of the band (and was moved away at
times) that seemed to be a fully addressable light emitting array of
some sort. When it wasn't on, it was translucent, which allowed them to
do all sorts of combination effects if the band was between the screens,
in front of one only, or in front of both. It is pretty hard to describe
but the combination effects for creating, at one point, landscapes
around the band and, another, shimmering curtains of static with holes
where band members were (all moving in real time) was really
overwhelming. You can [see some bad handheld
footage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwV5cWLFM9U) of this from the
Seattle date of the tour on Youtube. The quality is low but it gives you
an idea of the effects. One example of the screen in front is pretty
clear about 35 seconds into it but it is worth watching the whole thing
as the creator cuts between various effects (turn the scratchy sound
down a bit though...). *Youtube seems to have a higher quality version
of the video available if you go to the page for it and select the
link.*

Trent Reznor played a lot of music from the last couple of albums and I
was surprised (and happy) to hear some of the much more ambient stuff
from **[Ghosts I - IV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosts_I–IV)** as
well. The crowd seemed perfectly happy with the more danceable songs
mixed in with the much more meditative. He threw in a couple of old
tokens, like **Head Like a Hole** and **Closer**, but he clearly was
more interested in playing the more recent material.

During the 1990s, those of us who were huge NIN fans despaired that
Trent Reznor was just going to disappear musically. He had very little
output and clearly, as has been stated in places, was fighting drug
issues during that time. This has all completely turned around in the
last five years where he's producing music almost faster than people can
take it in. **[Pretty Hate
Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Hate_Machine)**, NIN's
first album, came out the first year that I was in college after I
dropped out of high school. The band has been the musical backdrop to my
adult life and, with little exaggeration, NIN has been my favorite band
for this entire period. It was nice to finally get to see Trent live on
stage and with such an incredible show. **Update:** I found this comment
on a review of another show in this tour online:

> "NIN’s stage technology and advanced graphical display was
> spectacular. The band employed two mesh LED screens on stage coupled
> with a normal video screen in the rear. This innovative display
> allowed the band to appear in front of graphics or immersed within
> them. I was very close to the stage, and I was continually attempting
> to figure out how the special effects were performed. It must have
> taken quite a bit of computer programming and enormous amounts of cash
> to design the show’s visuals.

So, it appears that they were LED-based, as I suspected.
