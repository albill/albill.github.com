[![Tricycle Cover
2009](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1413/3266975429_97d45c145d_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/3266975429/)[Tricycle
magazine](http://www.tricycle.com/) seems to be doing a good job at
promoting their new community site at
[http://community.tricycle.com/](http://community.tricycle.com/).
Effectively, it is a social networking site (similar to Facebook or
Livejournal) for Buddhists. I know that quite a few people have had
criticisms of Tricycle, especially around its seeming ethnocentric focus
on White "Boomer" Buddhism but the site looks like a fair attempt to me
to build an online community in the right way. I'd encourage people to
take a look and try making an account there. I've created [an
account](http://community.tricycle.com/profile/Al) there and will be
giving it a try over the next while. (*I'm saying this as someone who
doesn't even subscribe to their magazine either...*) Social networking
has a lot to offer for Buddhist practitioners, especially those that are
separated geographically or socially from other Buddhists. As I've
mentioned before, because of the way things have worked out, I generally
practice alone or with my wife and not with an established sangha
(because my core sangha isn't local to me). I've found positive
participation in community to be extremely helpful in feeling supported
by and connected to other practitioners.\
