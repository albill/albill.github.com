The seller came back after we gave the list of about two and a half
grand of repairs that were needed and said, basically, "I'm not going to
do them but I'll give you three grand off of the closing for you to do
them." R and I decided that this is acceptable so we have moved to the
next stage (somewhere after denial), which is our mortgage broker
inspecting the property. It is thought to be unlikely that they'll flag
the same problems that we did so, gods willing, we may be able to sign
in a week or so and actually move in around 6/21... *looks at giant
mounds of books and computer pieces surrounding him...* Shit, I hate
packing.
