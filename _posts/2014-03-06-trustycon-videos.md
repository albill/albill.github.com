TrustyCon 2014 (maybe the only one ever) happened the other week as a competitor to the RSA convention because of perceived RSA collaboration with the NSA and all of the kerfuffle around the NSA and surveillance this last year. As they say on [their site](https://www.trustycon.org/), "We welcome all security researchers, practitioners and citizens who are interested in discussing the technical, legal and ethical underpinnings of a stronger social contract between users and technology."

The event sold out quickly so I was unable to attend. Helpfully, it was livestreamed, making it available to everyone and the resulting video was put up on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkO8SNiDSw0). Unfortunately, this video is one, ginormous, seven hour video. I don't know about you but I like my viewing in smaller chunks. I also tend to listen to talks and presentations, especially when there is no strong visual component, by saving the audio portion of it to my [huffduffer account](http://huffduffer.com/albill) and listening to the resulting feed as a podcast.

I took it on myself to do a quick and dirty slice and dice on the seven plus hour video. It isn't perfect (I'm a program manager, not a video editor!) but it works. I've uploaded the resulting videos to my youtube channel in order to not destroy any servers I own. You can find the playlist of them all [here](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5PdOpurzJl_rZRu4hH6PVkBuHshDRmry) but I've also included the videos embedded below.

Additionally, I extracted the audio from each of these files and put an [audio collection](https://archive.org/details/TrustyCon2014) up on the Internet Archive, for people like me who just want to listen to them.
