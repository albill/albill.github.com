I just spent two hours doing Greek homework. Mr. Sharpy turns out to be very good on Mz. Notecard for copying vocabulary, declension of A-Declension short voweled nouns and A-Declension masculine nounds along with all of the prepositions that I know...

I didn't sleep well last night I figured coffee would be good when I got home (I drank decaf at work this afternoon...). I've had a whole pot now. <strong>WHEEEE!</strong>

I'm reading <strong>the</strong> recommended text on <a href="http://www.karmapa.org.nz/prayers/teach/generate.html">generation of the deity</a> in Tantric practice. It is an interesting text (<em>Generating the Deity</em> by Gyatrul Rinpoche). It mentions, among many things, something that stuck out this evening. That is that NRI is the seed syllable for humans because beings of all six classes have a seed syllable. I'm not sure what to make of that or what use it is but it just stuck out somehow.

I'm alternating that with McAuley's <a href="http://www.sfsite.com/04b/sl102.htm">The Secret of Life</a>. <a href="http://www.omegacom.demon.co.uk/">Paul McAuley</a> is one of my favorite current science fiction authors. <a href="http://www.sfsite.com/05a/fl127.htm">Fairyland</a> and <a href="http://www.strangewords.com/archive/reddust.html">Red Dust</a> are two of my favorites of his. Hell, even <a href="http://www.michaelswanwick.com/nonfic/mcauley.html">Michael Swanwick loves him...</a> (and if you can't trust Swanwick, who can you trust?) So far, the book is quite good.
<blockquote><em>"The whole wide world is no longer big enough to hide in.  Everywhere is connected to everywhere else.  Everywhere -- the air of the most desolate desert, the wind above the waves of the most remote part of the oceans: everywhere -- is laced with electronic chatter.  We once believed that the world was packed, wingtip to wingtip, with invisible and omnipresent angels whispering the word of God to His entire creation, leaning through our skulls to speak to our souls.  Now, our flesh is continually swept by an invisible and omnipresent rain of information, quantum packers, strings of zeros and ones, on its way from somewhere to somewhere else.  How different are out dreams?" </em></blockquote>
Needless to say, this is a rather random entry...Back to the books for now.
