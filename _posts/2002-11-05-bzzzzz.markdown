I just spent two hours doing Greek homework. Mr. Sharpy turns out to be
very good on Mz. Notecard for copying vocabulary, declension of
A-Declension short voweled nouns and A-Declension masculine nounds along
with all of the prepositions that I know... I didn't sleep well last
night I figured coffee would be good when I got home (I drank decaf at
work this afternoon...). I've had a whole pot now. **WHEEEE!** I'm
reading **the** recommended text on [generation of the
deity](http://www.karmapa.org.nz/prayers/teach/generate.html) in Tantric
practice. It is an interesting text (*Generating the Deity* by Gyatrul
Rinpoche). It mentions, among many things, something that stuck out this
evening. That is that NRI is the seed syllable for humans because beings
of all six classes have a seed syllable. I'm not sure what to make of
that or what use it is but it just stuck out somehow. I'm alternating
that with McAuley's [The Secret of
Life](http://www.sfsite.com/04b/sl102.htm). [Paul
McAuley](http://www.omegacom.demon.co.uk/) is one of my favorite current
science fiction authors.
[Fairyland](http://www.sfsite.com/05a/fl127.htm) and [Red
Dust](http://www.strangewords.com/archive/reddust.html) are two of my
favorites of his. Hell, even [Michael Swanwick loves
him...](http://www.michaelswanwick.com/nonfic/mcauley.html) (and if you
can't trust Swanwick, who can you trust?) So far, the book is quite
good.

> *"The whole wide world is no longer big enough to hide in. Everywhere
> is connected to everywhere else. Everywhere -- the air of the most
> desolate desert, the wind above the waves of the most remote part of
> the oceans: everywhere -- is laced with electronic chatter. We once
> believed that the world was packed, wingtip to wingtip, with invisible
> and omnipresent angels whispering the word of God to His entire
> creation, leaning through our skulls to speak to our souls. Now, our
> flesh is continually swept by an invisible and omnipresent rain of
> information, quantum packers, strings of zeros and ones, on its way
> from somewhere to somewhere else. How different are out dreams?"*

Needless to say, this is a rather random entry...Back to the books for
now.
