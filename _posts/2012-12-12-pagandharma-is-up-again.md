I had a brief project in 2011 called "Pagan Dharma" that was up on [pagandharma.org](http://pagandharma.org). I wound up feeling uninspired to write much at the time and my co-author got busy with her graduate work and other things, like health, so eventually I took the site down.

Yesterday, I put the site back up and I've retrieved the old content from the [Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org). I added two things as well:

* [Reinvention?](http://pagandharma.org/pagan%20dharma/2012/12/12/reinvention/) - basically saying why I put the site back up.
* [Whatâ€™s the point of a Pagan Dharma, Part One ](http://pagandharma.org/pagan%20dharma/2012/12/12/whats-the-point-of-a-pagan-dharma-part-one/) - the first in a multi-part series of turgid prose from my point of view about the idea of Pagan Dharma.

Some of my readers here may be inclined to read such things. Since I don't actually know who my "base" is anymore, it is hard to say but there it is.

Catherine is going to write some more as well, I expect, based on our communications and there is the potential for another suprise guest author in this next month if he finds the spare time to write some things up.
