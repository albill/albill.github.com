I wrote to Naropa asking them about the "upcoming" MA in Buddhist
Studies listed on their distance learning site. This is their response:

> Dear Al, Thank you for your interest in Naropa Online. The low
> residency MA Buddhist Studies degree is being launched in summer 2004.
> Until then, you can take individual classes for graduate credit and
> apply them to the degree, when it begins. Below is the list of
> currently offered courses you can apply towards the future degree:
>
> > [REL 500e Meditation Practicum
> > I](http://www.naropa.edu/distance/courses/REL500e.htm) [REL 536e
> > Buddhist Teachings on Mind and Emotions: The Abhidharma
> > Tradition](http://www.naropa.edu/distance/courses/REL536e.htm) [REL
> > 510e Meditation Practicum
> > II](http://www.naropa.edu/distance/courses/REL510e.htm) [REL 532e

I'm really thinking about doing this, lack of specific thing to do with
this degree or not. It isn't cheap (the degree will probably take me
about 2 1/2 years and cost around $18K) but I can do it. Of course, I
won't be able to finish taking Latin if I start a class this fall
because Latin 104 is the last class of my first year series and it
doesn't start until the end of September. I'm starting 103 next week.
