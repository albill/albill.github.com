I wrote to Naropa asking them about the "upcoming" MA in Buddhist Studies listed on their distance learning site.

This is their response:<blockquote>Dear Al,
Thank you for your interest in Naropa Online. 
The low residency MA Buddhist Studies degree is being launched in summer
2004. Until then, you can take individual classes for graduate credit
and apply them to the degree, when it begins. Below is the list of
currently offered courses you can apply towards the future degree:<blockquote><a href="http://www.naropa.edu/distance/courses/REL500e.htm">REL 500e Meditation Practicum I</a>
<a href="http://www.naropa.edu/distance/courses/REL536e.htm">REL 536e Buddhist Teachings on Mind and Emotions: The Abhidharma Tradition</a>
<a href="http://www.naropa.edu/distance/courses/REL510e.htm">REL 510e Meditation Practicum II</a>
<a href="http://www.naropa.edu/distance/courses/REL532e.htm">REL 532e Buddhism: The Way of Wisdom and Compassion</a> </blockquote>However, for graduate programs a student may only transfer in up to 6
credits. This applies whether it is taken through Naropa or outside of
Naropa. This means that you can take two individual courses only before
entering into the program.

The Course Listings for current and future semesters are at:
<a href="http://www.naropa.edu/distance/courses.htm">www.naropa.edu/distance/courses.htm</a>

The individual courses have their own pages with schedules and a lot of
additional information. To get a feel of how a Naropa online class looks
like please go to the Demo Course: <a href="http://www.naropa.edu/distance/demo">www.naropa.edu/distance/demo</a>
which includes five units from five different Naropa courses.

Please send me an email or call me if you need more help.

Best wishes,

Of course, I won&apos;t be able to finish taking Latin if I start a class this fall because Latin 104 is the last class of my first year series and it doesn&apos;t start until the end of September. I&apos;m starting 103 next week.
