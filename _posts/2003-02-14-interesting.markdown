Reading both of the issues of "Whatever happened to the Cyberculture?"
bit is kind of odd for me. It seems that I'm right in that nexus. I was
a Geek who got on the Internet in the late 80s through a hacked account
at the Engineering dial-in at the university, played on the muds, ran a
BBS and read Mondo 2000 as it started coming out... Later on, I worked
in Tech Support as the "Year of the Internet" (per Time Magazine in
1994) hit. Then I was a webmaster and then a tester on Internet Explorer
4 and then IE5... I worked for MSN as a contractor in 1996 before I
worked on IE and I worked for MSN as a test lead just this last year...
I remember the first issue of Wired and how completely cool it was for
me. I remember being on the Extropians original e-mail list in college
and getting their Zine. I remember Cypherpunks starting and being on its
e-mail list for the early years of crypto thought online... There's
probably a book or something in it but there is hardly enough distance
to write it and I'm not the best necessarily for it anyway. I was
definitely part of the Gen-X group that hit things at just the right
time to precede the Internet boom for years and, now, to follow it after
its imposion. I've spent half of my life online now (and I'll be 32 this
year). This is the part where I could go "Where did it all go wrong?!"
but I know... Money has its own force, demands and gravity. It sucked us
in, deflated our dreams and made the whole thing base and ordinairy.
