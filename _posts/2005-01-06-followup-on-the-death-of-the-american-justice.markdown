**We Are All Torturers Now** By MARK DANNER AT least since Watergate,
Americans have come to take for granted a certain story line of scandal,
in which revelation is followed by investigation, adjudication and
expiation. Together, Congress and the courts investigate high-level
wrongdoing and place it in a carefully constructed narrative, in which
crimes are charted, malfeasance is explicated and punishment is
apportioned as the final step in the journey back to order, justice and
propriety. When Alberto Gonzales takes his seat before the Senate
Judiciary Committee today for hearings to confirm whether he will become
attorney general of the United States, Americans will bid farewell to
that comforting story line. The senators are likely to give full
legitimacy to a path that the Bush administration set the country on
more than three years ago, a path that has transformed the United States
from a country that condemned torture and forbade its use to one that
practices torture routinely. Through a process of redefinition largely
overseen by Mr. Gonzales himself, a practice that was once a clear and
abhorrent violation of the law has become in effect the law of the land.
