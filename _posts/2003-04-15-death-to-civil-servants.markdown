Well, I've been up for about 24 hours now including 14 of them on planes
and about seven or so of them in airpors in addition to that. I barely
know where I am. I will say that once I exited my aircraft in Seattle,
it took me an hour and a half to get out of the building. Fucking
customs and security. How many times do they REALLY need to x-ray our
shit? Anyway, I'm back and cranky.
