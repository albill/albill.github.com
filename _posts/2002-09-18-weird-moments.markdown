I've been feeling some ambivilance on my spiritual path. This is not new nor is it surprising. I've been doing and studying the Buddhist thing a bit lately but my path, for the eight years specifically, has been that of Hermetic magic. Before that, and still to some degree, I've been a Neopagan.

I've recently been getting more and more into the Buddhist end of things. Studying, reading, attending empowerments. I won't say my work in other areas has waned in proportion to this but it has been effected. I've felt more and more drawn into things Buddhist but I don't commit, as a rule, to other people's trips. My working group for Ogdoadic work has lost people in the last six months and it has been hard to fight the feeling that things are in an unalterable decline for the group as well.

This is backplot.

On Sunday, it was a normal meeting night for Ouroboros, the Ogdoadic group. We did a ritual that was outside of the normal patterns of what we've worked before. It was one distributed by the Aurum Solis last year as a working for everyone to do on the same night (the Full Moon in Virgo if I recall). It's based off of a structure and formula that isn't in any of the other work we have. Ouroboros decided that it would be a good ritual practice/experience to work with that ritual now as a group. We did this ritual, which is a pretty heavy invocation of the space after consecrating it elementally and with the planets and/or sephiroth. The ritual itself was pretty interesting and it went well. I didn't feel a huge charge of it but I felt that it worked and worked well.

Afterwards, when people had left, I noticed a change in attitude. The ritual reminded me of everything I like about being involved in Hermetic magic, the beauty of it, the history and philosophy behind it. I felt a great impetus to be more regular in my ritual work, to study more and I felt almost a push back into its enfolding embrace. In contrast, while the Buddhist work is still appealing and intellectually interesting, I felt that the riverlike current that had been pulling me further and further into it and its worldview had been diverted back into its old channels.

I can't help feel like the ritual was a purification and reconsecration of myself into the tradition that I work within, in a way. There are still the same problems that it had before but I feel more at ease with them and I feel once again committed to the Great Work.

This isn't to say that I'm dumping the Buddhist studies and practices. I find strong value there. I'm just no longer feeling pulled away from my magical background. I didn't feel pulled away as such before but now, in retrospect, it feels like I was as the pull has now vanished.

I'm not sure what to make of this whole thing but it isn't a bad thing. I took the opportunity the last two nights to finish putting together the temple space in the basement of the new house (I had to hang 16 yards of 90" fabric that I had dyed on the walls to wall off space and hide the walls) and I began heavier work on my practices during the last two days. I've actively begun working on my personal program and curriculum again as well.
