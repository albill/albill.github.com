This isn't a technical blog and even though I am a geek, I have a lot of other interests. It is also just easier, in so many ways, to "not go there" given the controversies around my employer with various factions. Some critics have good points that I even occasionally agree with but I've always thought that it was best to stay out of the line of fire.

Earlier this month, the paper says, a Microsoft senior vice president told a group of gay and lesbian employees about the threatened boycott -- and explained that Microsoft would henceforth be "neutral" on a bill it had previously supported. War Room contacted Microsoft for a response this morning; while a member of Microsoft's "rapid response" PR team promised us we'd be hearing from a Microsoft spokeswoman promptly, we're still waiting.

"Apparently, Microsoft's new motto is 'your potential, our passion, as long as you're not gay or lesbian,'" Dan Kully, a spokesman for Equal Rights Washington, told us this afternooon. Earlier today, John Aravosis of <a title="http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/%20http://www.americablog.org/" target="new" lid="AMERICAblog" href="http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/%20http://www.americablog.org/"> AMERICAblog</a> suggested in an open letter to Microsoft that advocates of gay rights in Washington could retaliate against the company by organizing concentrated local opposition to its plan to expand its Redmond campus.

"But here's something you didn't count on. You messed with the wrong faggots." Aravosis wrote those words just as the story of Microsoft's position on the bill was first making the rounds on the internet -- and before the state senate had rejected the bill by a single vote. If Microsoft was beginning to feel the pain then, we can only imagine what life is like in Redmond right now.

I don't know him well but he knows me by name because of shared history, time in the same organization, and a number of meetings where I and others have presented to him on minor issues. I wanted to express my concerns.

I made it clear that I recognized that he wasn't likely to have been involved in this whole thing but I wanted to communicate it up the food chain at work. He wrote me back on Thursday evening (after work) and made it clear that he hadn't known about this before it got brought up on Thursday and he took it seriously. The next morning, before I got to work, I had another e-mail from him where he cc'd his head of human resources and told me that Stafford Mays, who does a lot of the diversity work in our Human Resources at Microsoft, would be giving me a call on Friday. If I didn't hear from him, I should let my VP know. About 20 minutes after this e-mail was sent (again, before I'd even gotten in), I had a voice mail from Stafford trying to reach me. He called me back shortly after work and had a good conversation.

I was told to expect that an e-mail to the entire company would be going out about it. That happened late Friday.

I'm not happy with it at all. I think it sets a bad precedent. It also doesn't address some of the factual issues raised in the article in <b>The Stranger</b> and in subsequent reports from talking to legislature. It feels, to me, like corporate spin and damage control and, actually, it pisses me off.

We should only be making money for shareholders." I think that's bunk. Business is not separate from the rest of society and companies can and do take a moral stance on issues. If this was the early 1960s and we were talking about race, would people still feel that not supporting the bill would be ok?

This isn't a gay marriage law or the like. This is strictly a bill about anti-discrimination. The same rules are already in effect in King County, where Microsoft is based, and have been for years.

I have been required to take anti-harrassment training (and they check if you do it) in an effort to promote this. Microsoft's benefits extend to domestic partnerships for gays and lesbians. This is about walking the talk. If it is good enough to be progressive within the company, why not back a bill that extends anti-discrimination outside the company? It is inconsistent, at best, not to do so. The only explanation that I see is that Microsoft's leadership is afraid of being seen as being pro-gay rights. Well, I'm sorry folks but Microsoft internal policies and benefits already put us in that particular camp. Anyone that would go after the company for backing the bill is going to have their knickers in a twist about the internal policies.

It isn't right.
