John Daido Loori, the general abbot of the [Mountains and Rivers
Order](http://www.mro.org/) (MRO) and Zen Mountain Monastery in New
York, [died today](http://www.shambhalasun.com/news/?p=6307). Bernie
Glassman wrote a [tribute](http://www.shambhalasun.com/news/?p=6312) on
his Dharma brother's passing today that is worth reading. I know that he
has had a remarkable effect and been an influence on many many Buddhists
in America, Zen or otherwise. I know that his writings have affected me
greatly and I feel a bit of sadness at his passing, as natural as it is
for all of us. I ask people to pause and reflect on him and then their
own lives, this very moment with the passing of this great American
teacher and leader. **Update**: I enjoyed [this
entry](http://zendirtzendust.blogspot.com/2009/10/meditation-on-death-zombies-and-buddhas.html)
at Sweep the dust, push the dirt. The part below especially stuck with
me as a practitioner:

1.  I am of the nature to grow old. There is no way to escape growing
    old.
2.  I am of the nature to have ill health. There is no way to escape ill
    health.
3.  I am of the nature to die. There is no way to escape death.
4.  All that is dear to me and everyone I love are of the nature to
    change. There is no way to escape being separated from them.
5.  My actions are my only true belongings. I cannot escape the
    consequences of my actions. My actions are the ground upon which I
    stand.
