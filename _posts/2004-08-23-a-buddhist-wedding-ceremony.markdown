I found this ceremony online while looking for different wedding rituals.
<h1>A Buddhist Wedding Ceremony</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<em>Notes from the creator of this ceremony that you might like to  include in your introduction of this ceremony to guests.  </em>

A few words about Buddhist marriages
<ul>
	<li>Buddhism is a path of transformation of one’s inner potential</li>
	<li>It is a path dedicated to serving others, helping them awaken their  potential</li>
	<li>Marriage is the vehicle to practice serving others. It is a practice  ground.</li>
	<li>Love is wishing others happiness</li>
	<li>Marriage is the equal commitment to the happiness of your partner,  toward their awakening.</li>
	<li>Our inner potential is developed through taking on challenges, not  just through joy.</li>
	<li>We need people in order to practice compassion</li>
	<li>Since their marriage is dedicated toward the happiness of all living  beings,  those gathered here are the representatives of all living beings.</li>
	<li>Marriage is not usually performed by monks/nuns (if the ceremony is  being  performed by a monk or nun)</li>
	<li>The creator of this ceremony was married by Lama Yeshe and put this  ceremony together in order to further this lineage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Buddhist Wedding Prayer</h2>
Today we promise to dedicate ourselves completely to each other, with body, speech, and mind.

In this life, in every situation, in wealth or poverty, in health or  sickness, in  happiness or difficulty, we will work to help each other perfectly.

The purpose of our relationship will be to attain enlightenment by  perfecting our  kindness and compassion toward all sentient beings.

<em>Lama Thubten Yeshe </em>

<em>December 1979</em>
<h2>Vows</h2>
________ and ________, are happy today not only because they can  share the joy of their  love for each other with friends and family, but also because they have the  opportunity to  express their aspirations for the future.

________ and ________, do you pledge to help each other to develop your  hearts and  minds, cultivating compassion, generosity, ethics, patience, enthusiasm,  concentration  and wisdom as you age and undergo the various ups and downs of life and  to transform  them into the path of love, compassion, joy and equanimity?

<em>“We do”</em>

Recognizing that the external conditions in life will not always be  smooth and that  internally your own minds and emotions will sometimes get stuck in  negativity. Do you  pledge to see all these circumstances as a challenge to help you grow, to  open your  hearts, to accept yourselves, and each other; and to generate compassion  for others who  are suffering? Do you pledge to avoid becoming narrow, closed or  opinionated, and to  help each other to see various sides of situations?

<em>“We do”</em>

Understanding that just as we are a mystery to ourselves, each other  person is also a  mystery to us. Do you pledge to seek to understand yourselves, each  other, and all living  beings, to examine your own minds continually and to regard all the  mysteries of life  with curiosity and joy?

<em>“We do”</em>

Do you pledge to preserve and enrich your affection for  each other, and to share it with  all beings? To take the loving feelings you have for one another and your  vision of each  other's potential and inner beauty as an example and rather than  spiraling inwards and  becoming self absorbed, to radiate this love outwards to all beings?

<em>“We do”</em>

When it comes time to part, do you pledge to look back at your time  together with joy--joy that you met and shared what you have--and acceptance that we cannot  hold on to  anything forever?

<em>“We do” </em>

Do you pledge to remember the disadvantages of ignorance, anger and  clinging  attachment, to apply antidotes when these arise in your minds, and to  remember the  kindness of all other beings and your connection to them? Do you pledge  to work for  the welfare of others, with all of your compassion, wisdom and skill?

<em>“We do” </em>

Do you pledge to work to develop the wisdom understanding the relative  functioning  nature of things and the wisdom knowing their deeper way of existence that they are  empty of inherent existence? And to remember the laws of cause and  effect?

<em>‘We do”</em>

Do you pledge day to day, to be patient with yourselves and others,  knowing that change  comes slowly and gradually, and to seek inspiration from your teachers  not to become  discouraged?

<em>“We do” </em>

Do you pledge to continuously strive to remember your own Buddha nature,  as well as  the Buddha nature of all living beings? To maintain the awareness that  all things are  temporary, and to remain optimistic that you can achieve your greatest  potential and  lasting happiness.

<em>“We do” </em>
<h2>Exchanging of Rings</h2>
“The wedding ring is the outward and visible sign of an inward and  spiritual  bond which unites two loyal hearts in partnership.”
<h2>Pronouncement</h2>
“By the power vested in me through the wishes of Bonnie and Robert, as  well as  the blessing of the lineage of their Spiritual Friends, I now pronounce  you Husband and  Wife.” (Offer katags to the couple, or one long katag over both of them together)
<h2>Presenting and Congratulating the Couple</h2>
“Ladies and Gentlemen please join me in congratulating Mr. and Mrs.  _____________.”
<h3>Colophon</h3>
Created by John Karuna Cayton for the wedding ceremony of Bonnie Le Boeuf  and Robert  Baptist, May 2002. Inspired by Lama Thubten Yeshe when he performed the  wedding  ceremony for Karuna and Pam Cayton.
