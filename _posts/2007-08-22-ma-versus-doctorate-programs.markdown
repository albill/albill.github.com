I had lunch with [Scott](http://djbuddha.org/) yesterday. He's finishing
up his PhD at the Graduate Theological Union (GTU) and has an MA through
the Institute for Buddhist Studies. I've been considering getting an MA
through them, there Master of Arts in Buddhist Studies, recently. I have
previously considered getting a PhD through GTU. Part of the barrier
with the PhD is that I would not be able to work full time, especially
during the first few years of course work, and pursue it. The fact that
the program is in a private school combined with a lack of full time
work means a lot of financial difficulties. Scott and I spoke about this
quite a bit since he's living in this world right now. He works part of
the time at GTU (IBS) and has taught classes but he didn't pull any
punches about the financial end of things. One of the things that keeps
coming up is what I would do with a PhD if I got it. Ideally, I'd like
to teach but I don't talk about that much because I know quite a few
recent PhDs and one of the common things that they **all** are dealing
with is a lack of positions, especially tenure track positions, for
Humanities related disciplines. A lot of them are teaching as adjuncts
at multiple schools with no job security if they are able to find work
at all. Technically, with my MA, I can teach undergraduate programs,
especially in Humanities. Finding work doing such might be quite
difficult though. I love the idea of getting a PhD but I'm not sure I
really want to financially "ruin" myself in order to do it. If I knew
that I could still pay my bills while working on a PhD, I think I'd do
it. There is no reliable funding for doctoral students at GTU and
definitely nothing one could make a living doing. I need to decide in
the next couple of months if I want to apply for Fall, 2008 for GTU for
the PhDs programs. Scott made it pretty clear that he didn't think that
there would be a lot of value in me getting a second Master's degree by
going through IBS. His advice seemed to be to go straight into the PhD
program, leaving aside the financial issues. At this point, I'm agreeing
with this. If I continue in school, it will be in a PhD program. I am
planning on signing up for Japanese courses during this next year. I
need to decide if I want to go to a private program in San Francisco or
try to take undergraduate Japanese classes if I can work them into my
schedule.
