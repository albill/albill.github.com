R and I went out this evening with a couple of friends of hers from high
school. We went to see the band, "[Woven
Hand](http://www.soundsfamilyre.com/)," at the [Starry
Plough](http://www.starryploughpub.com/), a Berkeley bar.

The band is very much in the vein of Nick Cave in a way. It is very dark
and Biblical in a way. He's toured with Nick Cave and Morphine before so
his mood shouldn't be surprising. David Eugene Edwards, the singer, is
clearly very Christian but it reminds me more of the mood of the angry
and dark Christ, in the desert or attacking the moneylenders. The sweat
pours off of him as he plays and yells into his microphone. R and I both
noticed the whites of his eyes as they rolled up into his head as he
played. He has a very large tattoo on his arm that says "Y'shua" (Jesus)
in Hebrew:

The music is very good and I highly recommend it. You can hear some of
the music on the band's page on
[myspace](http://www.myspace.com/wovenhandmosaic). I've put a [small
photoset](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157600055276423/)
up on flickr as well.
