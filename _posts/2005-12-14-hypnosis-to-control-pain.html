<p>This doesn't really surprise me. My grandmother, a retired nurse, practiced hypnosis as part of her work with hospice patients to control pain. Later on, she used it on herself to control pain. I know that she had dental work (drilling) done without any anesthesia by hypnotizing herself...</p>
<h3>Brain scans help think away pain </h3>
<strong>It may really be a matter of mind over matter - scientists suggest it is  possible to control brain activity to reduce the pain you feel. </strong> Stanford University researchers found seeing brain scans and using mental  exercises helped reduce pain.</p>
<p>A UK pain expert said the work backed other studies which suggested changing  how people thought about pain could reduce its effects.</p>
<p>The research is in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.</p>
<p><strong>Hope </strong></p>
<p>Thirty-six volunteers took part in the study.</p>
<p>Heat was applied to their palms, with the temperature for each person set  	depending on what they found painful.</p>
<p>One group was placed inside a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner  	where they were able to watch their brain activity on a moment-by-moment  	basis.</p>
<p>They were then shown "live" action images of their rostral anterior  	cingulate cortex, an area of the brain responsible for processing pain.</p>
<p>Next, they were given various mental strategies to try to train the brain  	to respond to pain differently, such as being asked to think of it as a  	relatively pleasant experience.</p>
<p>Over time, the eight people who went through this training procedure  	showed an increased ability to modulate their response to pain.</p>
<p>Other groups were either shown no scans at all - and just given  	behavioural techniques to help them cope with pain, or shown scans of  	different areas of the brain, or those showing other people's pain  	responses.</p>
<p>People in these groups showed no changes in how they responded to pain.</p>
<p><strong>'Brain exercise' </strong></p>
<p>Dr Sean Mackey, who led the research, said the study findings offered  	great hope for people who suffer chronic pain.</p>
<p>"We could change people's lives.</p>
<p>"However, significantly more science and testing must be done before this  	can be considered a treatment for chronic pain."</p>
<p>He said it was not clear how people had controlled their brain activity,  	but added: "We really don't know how anyone controls their brain to perform  	an action."</p>
<p>Laura Tibbitt, 31, who took part in the study, has chronic back pain  	caused by a horseback riding accident seven years ago, said she used  	different thoughts to decrease the pain while watching her brain scans.</p>
<p>She said: "I'd think of little people on my back digging out the pain, or  	I'd think of snowflakes.</p>
<p>"The goal was to exercise your brain, to retrain your brain. Sometimes I  	felt like I had made a change in my brain. The pain was never completely  	gone, but it was better."</p>
<p>Dr Beverley Collett, president of the British Pain Society, said: "In  	some ways, this supports some of what we are already doing in pain  	treatment, using cognitive therapy to change how people think about their  	pain.</p>
<p>"And we know psychological treatments do help people manage their pain."
