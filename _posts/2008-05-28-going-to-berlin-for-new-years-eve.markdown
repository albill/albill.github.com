*Fernsehturm in Alexanderplatz*

I just got non-binding but relatively firm approval today at work to go
to Berlin at the end of the year. I'm going to go to the 25th Chaos
Communication Congress (25C3) this year for Mozilla, along with
"Tomcat," one of my German coworkers. The Chaos Communication Congress
is an annual four-day conference organized by the [Chaos Computer
Club](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club) in Germany. It
takes place at the Berliner Congress Center at
[Alexanderplatz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexanderplatz) in Berlin
(the former East Berlin). Over the four days, there are sessions from
the late morning through to past midnight on each day with the event
ending on December 30. Wikipedia states that the event has had 4,500
people in the past. If you go to the
[wiki](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Main_Page) for last year's
events, you can get more details. They have the [schedule up from last
year](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Fahrplan/) and it includes
sessions ranging from [Simulating the Universe on
Supercomputers](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Fahrplan/events/2155.en.html)
([*video*](http://chaosradio.ccc.de/24c3_m4v_2155.html)) to [Hacking in
the age of declining
everything](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Fahrplan/events/2272.en.html)
([*video*](http://chaosradio.ccc.de/24c3_m4v_2272.html)) and [Overtaking
Proprietary Software Without Writing
Code](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Fahrplan/events/2290.en.html)
([*video*](http://chaosradio.ccc.de/24c3_m4v_2290.html)). You can see
[recorded video](http://chaosradio.ccc.de/24c3_m4v.html) from last year
as an [iTunes
podcast](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=271251344)
as well. R plans to come to Germany as well though she may not attend
much of the congress. How often do you get a chance to go to Berlin for
New Year's Eve, after all? We'll probably arrive just after Christmas on
December 26, which is a Friday, and stay for eight days, leaving on
January 3. This will give us some time to see the sights in Berlin,
visit some museums, etc. after the congress is over before heading home.
I'll be pretty busy for much of the even since sessions run all
afternoon and evening for those four days. Still, it ought to be a lot
of fun. This makes for an even busier travel year between Canada in
July, Las Vegas in early August, Black Rock City at the end of August,
and Egypt in late September or early October. Of course, half of these
are for my work so they aren't all vacation but it is a lot of travel.
