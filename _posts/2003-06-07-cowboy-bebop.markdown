I watched the Cowboy Bebop movie this afternoon/morning since R is off at OTO initiations. I enjoyed it. It was fun to see something with them that was more than 24 minutes long. My only complaint is that the subtitles were complete Engrish at times. You occasionally had to guess at what someone was saying. Ah well. Sarasatro will be happy that I watched it.
