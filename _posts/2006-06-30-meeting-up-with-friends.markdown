My friend, Steve, aka "Teh Hotcrab," had his 31st birthday party last
night in the City (that's "San Francisco" for you non-Californians). We
went to a Japanese whiskey bar called "Nihon's" in Soma. It was a cool
place which served thirty or fifty different kinds of whiskey (though I
had a "Bell View," which was a vodka cocktail). Steve reserved the room
upstairs, which was supposed to hold thirty people but we were all
pretty skeptical of that. It was good to see Steve since I haven't seen
him in the flesh in at least two years. We chat on IM every so often but
he moved from Seattle a while back and I hadn't really gotten around to
seeing him before he left or on his occasional trips up. Steve works
over at Macromedia...I mean Adobe... so I got to meet quite a few of his
coworker friends as well as the San Francisco hipster crowd. I even got
to talk shop with a few people. On Wednesday, I also met with my friend,
Mark, for the first time on our own since we moved here. Mark and I met
at Pantheacon back in 2001 through mutual friends right after he moved
to the Bay Area. He's working as an applied anthropologist (he has the
PhD and everything!) within the corporate world. If I would have
actually made it to Anthropology graduate school as I had planned when I
originally left college, I could very easily have wound up doing similar
sort of work. It was interesting to hear about it and meet up. So far,
we haven't spent much time with too many people down here. Between
temporary housing, new jobs, and various tasks (along with my
schoolwork), there just hasn't been much time. Hopefully that will
change soon. Tomorrow, we move into our new loft space and our stuff
arrives on Monday...
