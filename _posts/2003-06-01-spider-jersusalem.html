So, I've never read <strong>Transmetropolitan</strong> before. This is a rather kick ass (and now defunct) comic series by Warren Ellis (<a href="http://diepunyhumans.com">http://www.diepunyhumans.com</a>) about a sociopathic journalist in some non-future named "Spider Jerusalem." This is despite the fact that I read Warren's RSS feed from his site and am on his badsignal e-mail list. Weird, eh?

While R and I were out this morning, I picked up the second graphic novel version of TM. This is fairly early on in the series (obviously) but it kicks some serious ass. I've been laughing my ass off on and off all day... Definitely good reading for cynical bastards.
