I'm going to be in Seattle from the morning of Friday, April 20 through the evening of Sunday, April 22. I haven't been back since we moved away at the beginning of June last year so I wanted to make a trip up.

I will be by myself since R took a trip to visit friends last month. If people want to see me or offer me a place to crash, please let me know.

So far, I plan to rent a car at the airport and I have made plans to have lunch with friends at Microsoft on Friday. I plan on spending some time with my daughter during the weekend as well, probably on Saturday, and seeing my grandparents at least for a couple of hours.

I especially hope to see a few near and dear people while I am there. If you cannot see me, I will pretend to understand but a black mark will go against your name until the end of time...
