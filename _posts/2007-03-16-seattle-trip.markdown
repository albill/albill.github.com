I'm going to be in Seattle from the morning of Friday, April 20 through
the evening of Sunday, April 22. I haven't been back since we moved away
at the beginning of June last year so I wanted to make a trip up. I will
be by myself since R took a trip to visit friends last month. If people
want to see me or offer me a place to crash, please let me know. So far,
I plan to rent a car at the airport and I have made plans to have lunch
with friends at Microsoft on Friday. I plan on spending some time with
my daughter during the weekend as well, probably on Saturday, and seeing
my grandparents at least for a couple of hours. I especially hope to see
a few near and dear people while I am there. If you cannot see me, I
will pretend to understand but a black mark will go against your name
until the end of time...
