Other than my birthday, I had a bit more social activity in the last few days than normal.

On Friday, my friend, Elizabeth, from Portland was visiting the area for yoga training at <a href="http://yogakula.com/">Yoga Kula</a> in Berkeley. I'm not sure how long it has been since I saw her but I'm sure it has been more than a year. We went out to dinner and coffee in order to chat. She mentioned that <a href="http://www.rajanaka.com/">Douglas Brooks</a> is associated with Yoga Kula and teaches there occasionally. I'd forgotten them. If you are interested in Hindu Tantricism, he is pretty well regarded.

On Monday, I had the day off because Mozilla makes your birthday an official holiday day. (How cool is that?) Jisho Sensei was in town for the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association in San Francisco. (This is where they discussed whether psychologists can help the CIA create their non-torture that I blogged about recently). Jisho is a clincal psychologist as well as being a priest and teacher in the Buddhist organization with which I am associated. Because he was in town for the conference, it seemed a good chance to get together.

Jisho had only been to the Bay Area once before and normally lives in Ohio. I took him over to the Japanese Tea Garden at Golden Gate Park and then down to the ocean. Later on, we went to a late lunch and got to spend a fair bit of time together discussing various Buddhist and academic things.

All in all, not an exciting weekend report but I was glad for the chance to see people.
