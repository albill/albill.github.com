> WASHINGTON, March 24 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Consumer Advocate Ralph Nader
> and Wesley J. Smith, author of the award winning book "Culture of
> Death: The Assault on Medical Ethics in America" call upon the Florida
> Courts, Governor Jeb Bush and concerned citizens to take any legal
> action available to let Terri Schiavo live.
>
> "A profound injustice is being inflicted on Terri Schiavo," Nader and
> Smith asserted today. "Worse, this slow death by dehydration is being
> imposed upon her under the color of law, in proceedings in which every
> benefit of the doubt-and there are many doubts in this case-has been
> given to her death, rather than her continued life."
>
> Among the many injustices in this case, Nader and Smith point to the
> following:
>
> The courts not only are refusing her tube feeding, but have ordered
> that no attempts be made to provide her water or food by mouth. Terri
> swallows her own saliva. Spoon feeding is not medical treatment. "This
> outrageous order proves that the courts are not merely permitting
> medical treatment to be withheld, it has ordered her to be made dead,"
> Nader and Smith assert.
