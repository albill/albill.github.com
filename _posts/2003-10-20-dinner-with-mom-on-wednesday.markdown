<i>I sent this out to friends, local OTO and Seattle Pagan Scholars people this evening...Local Seattle pagan and occult types are welcome here...</i>

Gretchen Faulk (Soror Ashera) is in town a little over a week. She presented her lecture on Nuit at the Seattle Pagan Scholars Meeting today and will be performing her Vespers of Nuit next weekend after the OTO&apos;s Gnostic Mass.

I&apos;m organizing a little dinner gathering for her on this coming wednesday. I&apos;ve spoken to a few people about this in passing but I wanted to send the particulars out.

I&apos;d like everyone to meet at "Bangkok on Fifteenth" on Capitol Hill at 7:00 on Wednesday. I&apos;ve included the address, phone number and a link to a map for it below. I figure we can eat there and maybe head to one of the nearby pubs for a drink afterwards.

Please RSVP me privately if you plan on attending so I can get a good idea of how many people are coming ahead of time.

Details:
7:00 PM - Wednesday, October 22
Bangkok On Fifteenth
