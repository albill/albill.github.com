*I sent this out to friends, local OTO and Seattle Pagan Scholars people
this evening...Local Seattle pagan and occult types are welcome here...*
Gretchen Faulk (Soror Ashera) is in town a little over a week. She
presented her lecture on Nuit at the Seattle Pagan Scholars Meeting
today and will be performing her Vespers of Nuit next weekend after the
OTO's Gnostic Mass. I'm organizing a little dinner gathering for her on
this coming wednesday. I've spoken to a few people about this in passing
but I wanted to send the particulars out. I'd like everyone to meet at
"Bangkok on Fifteenth" on Capitol Hill at 7:00 on Wednesday. I've
included the address, phone number and a link to a map for it below. I
figure we can eat there and maybe head to one of the nearby pubs for a
drink afterwards. Please RSVP me privately if you plan on attending so I
can get a good idea of how many people are coming ahead of time.
