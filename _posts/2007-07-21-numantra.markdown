Years ago, back around 1998, I saw a band in Seattle that stuck in my
head. This band was called "Numantra." They were an Eastern-influenced
act that included an electric sitar. I'm not sure who they opened for
but I am pretty sure it was at the Colorbox. That was a now-closed small
club in downtown Seattle that showed a lot of small acts. They were
probably opening for a local industrial band or Tchkung!, which is why I
would have been there. In any case, they had a CD available at the time
but I didn't get it. I was pretty poor at the time and I just didn't
feel like it (I guess). A month or so ago, I tracked down the CD on
Ebay. I've been quite happy that I found it and it is a pretty good set
of music. I just wish there was more of it but I heard they broke up not
too long after I saw them. I just found a circa 1998 music video of one
of the songs on the CD, "To Dream Away", this evening. It [is on Google
Video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5742823096057256621) and
I've added it to this post below. Enjoy!
