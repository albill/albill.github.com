So, I'm reading this Lovecraftian collection, "Shadows Over Innsmouth,"
which has Lovecraft's "Shadow Over Innsmouth" tale and then a collection
of related tales about the Deep Ones and Human-hybrids, etc. set in the
period following it. One of the tales is by Neil Gaiman, which I didn't
realize when I bought it. A weird thought occured to me, given the
period when Lovecraft wrote it and the whole thing about humans breeding
with other: is this tale some kind of allegory (intentional or not) to
the eugenics movement in the U.S. at this time (it's height) and its
concern about people breeding with other races or having unfit
offspring? An interesting thought... The tale makes me want to join the
Esoteric Order of Dagon though. ;-) I'm kind of bored at home. I crave
coffee and human company. I haven't seen anyone but family in days now.
