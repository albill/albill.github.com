I haven't looked but its got to be in the 90s or so in Seattle today. For around here, with our humidity, it's nasty hot. My cats are passed out on the floor and haven't moved for hours. Hell, the ferret even looks tired.

(I think it was my curry from the other day...). It is quite a different book from <b>Singularity Sky</b>. I haven't decided how I feel about it though I think, at a basic level, it is an entertaining read. To read something light, I started my used copy of <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0451459490/">Wyrmhole</a></b> today. So far, it is interesting but I'm not sure if it is interesting enough...

I got up a little before 6:00 AM and drove down to McNeil Island and...missed my ferry by about two minutes. I watched it pull away as I got up to the doc. So, I waited an hour and fifteen for the next one. Once I got out there, I found the guys waiting and I did a normal two hour session or so with them. I handed out some study material and we'll see how it goes. The dynamics of dealing with inmates is kind of interesting and the group has undergone some kind of internal power shift over the last six months. Some of the people that used to go have either been transferred out or have quit coming, depending on the guy. One particular fellow and his buddies is kind of in charge of their ritual work now but the others seem to back this. It isn't really my call to make since they need to come to accommodations on their own for what they do and how they practice. I got back to the mainland around noon, drove up to Seattle and did a little time-wasting on Capitol Hill.

That's the deal for how we're justifying the costs for it. We've received <b>The Man Who Wasn't There</b>, <b>The Triplets of Belleville</b>, and <b>Millenium, Season 1, Disc 1</b> today. The triplets is for her and the Millenium show stuff is for me. R and I also went out for ice cream last night and, while we were out, I picked up a couple of things for my camping trip in New York this coming week (like a tarp and such). We also, finally, picked up a cheap GPS unit so we can play the geocache game. Of course, I can also use it while camping... uh huh...

He's doing volunteer work at the library there. Nothing out of the ordinary in our discussions, the normal ranting and such.
