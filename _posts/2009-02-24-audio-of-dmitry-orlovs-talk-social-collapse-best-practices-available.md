The <a href="http://www.longnow.org">Long Now Foundation</a> maintains a <a href="http://www.longnow.org/projects/seminars/podcast.php">podcast</a> of audio from their seminars. I <a href="/2009/02/15/dmitry-orlov-on-the-best-practices-for-societal-collapse/">blogged recently</a> about the talk that <a href="http://cluborlov.blogspot.com">Dmitry Orlov</a> did, "<a href="http://cluborlov.blogspot.com/2009/02/social-collapse-best-practices.html">Social Collapse Best Practices</a>." I noticed in iTunes this morning that the talk is now available through the Long Now's podcast.

You can also get it directly <a href="http://fora.tv/media/rss/Long_Now_Podcasts/podcast-2009-02-13-orlov.mp3">here</a> if you're so inclined.

Additionally, Dmitry gave a talk the day before at Point Reyes Bookstore. The <a href="http://web.mac.com/bgong/Site/Home_Page/Entries/2009/2/23_Dmitry_Orlov_speaking_at_Point_Reyes_Books.html">audio</a> of this talk is available as well. Dmitry says it covers largely the same ground as his Long Now talk except it was done unscripted. (I haven't listened to it yet...).
