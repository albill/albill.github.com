I'm on a Daniel Quinn focused list with what seems to be a herd of fucking tree huggers. The group had a meeting the other week (I've attended a couple but the group freaks me in its hippy-ness and rampant leftism) and "decided" on a bunch of new rules for the list that we all happen to use even though most of us weren't there and they don't run the list themselves per se (no one does really).

One of these rules is about how you have to show up to a meeting every three months (they meet at least once a month) or you will be removed from the list. Where did this authoritarian streak run into the happy hippies?

Anyway, I took umbrage at this and had a nice rant about why I haven't come to any meetings since the first two. A number of others have reacted in a similar manner. One of them closed with the following quotes, which I thought to be of good quality:
<blockquote>"Patriotism in its simplest, clearest and most indubitable
signification is nothing else but a means of obtaining for the rulers
their ambitions and covetous desires, and for the ruled the abdication
of human dignity, reason, and conscience, and a slavish enthralment to
those in power."
<strong>- Leo Tolstoy</strong></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Disobedience, in the eyes of any one who has read history, is man's
original virtue. It is through disobedience that progress has been
made, through disobedience and through rebellion."
<strong>- Oscar Wilde</strong></blockquote>
