Received by Sir Edward Kelley with Dr. John Dee in 1595 as a
communication from the spirits.

Transcribed from Cotton Appendix XLVI, Division XII, "Actio Tertio
Trebonae Generalis", ff. 218-220

> I am the daughter of fortitude, & ravished every hour, from\
>  my youth, for behold, I am understanding, &\
>  science dwelleth in me : & the heavens oppress me,\
>  They covet and desire me with infinite appetite\
>  few or none that are earthly have embraced me\
>  for I am shadowed with the circle of the sun : and covered with\
>  the morning clouds: My feet are swifter than the winds,\
>  & my hands are sweeter than the morning dew. My garments\
>  are from the beginning: & my dwelling place is in my\
>  self. The lion knoweth not where I walk : neither\
>  do the beasts of the field understand me. I am deflowered &\
>  yet a virgin. I sanctify & am not sanctified\
>  happy is he that embraceth me. for in the night season\
>  I am sweet, in the day full of pleasure
>
> my company is a harmony of many cymbals\
>  And my lips sweeter than health itself. I am a harlot\
>  for such as ravish me : and a virgin with such as know\
>  me not : for lo I am loved of many : & I am a\
>  lover to many: and as many as come unto me as they should\
>  do, have their entertainment. Purge your streets o\
>  you sons of men, & wash your houses clean\
>  Make your selves holy, & put on righteousness\
>  Cast out your old strumpets, & burn their clothes\
>  Abstain from the company of other women that are\
>  defiled, that are sluttish, & not so handsome, &\
>  beautiful as I. And then will I come & dwell\
>  amongst you. And behold I will bring forth\
>  Children unto you: & they shall be the sons of comfort\
>  I will open my garments, & stand naked before you\
>  that your love may be more enflamed toward me.
>
> As yet, I walk in the clouds, As yet, I am carried with\
>  the winds : And can not descend unto you for the multitude\
>  of your abominations, & the filthy loathsomeness of your dwelling\
>  places. Behold these fowre, who is he, that\
>  shall say, they have sinned : or unto whom shall\
>  they make account? Not unto you, you sons\
>  of men, nor unto your children : for unto the lord\
>  belongeth the Judgment of his servants
>
> Now therefore, let the earth give forth her fruits unto\
>  you : And let the mountains forsake their barrenness\
>  where your footsteps shall remain. happy is he that\
>  saluteth you : & cursed is he that holdeth up his\
>  hands against you. & power shall be given unto\
>  you from hence forth to resist your enemies : & the\
>  lord shall always here you in the times of your\
>  troubles. And I am sent unto you to play\
>  the harlot with you : And am to enrich you with the\
>  spoils of other men : prepare for me, for I come\
>  shortly. Provide your Chambers for me that they\
>  may be sweet & cleanly : for I will make a\
>  dwelling place amongst you : and I will be\
>  common with the father & the son, yea and with\
>  all them that truly favoreth you
>
> for my youth, is in her flower and my strength is not\
>  to be extinguished with man. Strong am I above &\
>  below. Therefore, provide for me. for behold I now\
>  salute you. And let peace be amongst you : for I\
>  am the Daughter of Comfort. Disclose not\
>  my secrets unto women : nether let them understand\
>  how sweet I am. for all things belongeth not unto\
>  every one
>
> I come unto you again.
