<a href="http://www.infosync.no/news/2002/n/2870.html">This</a> looks pretty cool. Of course, I could buy four color Dell PDAs for its price (like the one that I have). So much for PalmOS devices being really cheap and such. It seems that when these devices try to compete in color and media stuff, they wind up costing as much or more than any PocketPC device...
