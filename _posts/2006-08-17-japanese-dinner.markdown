R and I had dinner with Kat, her boyfriend, and Lefty this evening. We
met at a nice little Japanese restaurant in Japantown in San Francisco.
En-no-gyoja is in town for a Linux conference and this is the first time
we've seen him in person in a couple of years (he lives a bit further
south normally). I arrived a bit early so I was able to visit the
wonderful Japanese bookstore in the Japantown mally-thing, which was in
the same complex as the restaurant. I bought a manga done by the
creators **Lone Wolf and Cub**. This was [**Path of the
Assassin**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593075022/) and chronicles
the story of Hattori Hanzo. I also bought [**Full Metal
Apache**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0822337746/), which is on the
borrowing between Japanese and American culture in the context of manga
and science fiction, especially cyberpunk. It has chapters on William
Gibson's influences (incoming and outgoing), *Tetsuo*, and many others.
I also got a nice book with many old illustrations on Japanese ghosts
and demons. All fun stuff. Dinner was a lot of fun and it was good to
get over to the city for a few hours.
