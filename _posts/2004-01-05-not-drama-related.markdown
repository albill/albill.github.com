Ah, happy mail days are here again. While I was away from work this last
week, a number of packages arrived. In addition, one or two came today.
So, I now have my copies of **The Hidden God** by Martin Starr, [**Magic
Squares and
Cubes**](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0486206580/) by
W.S. Andrews (very hard to find at a decent price) and a bunch of Bonpo
related stuff sent to me by . Lots of stuff to read. I'm still working
my way through [**Ken Wilber: Thought As
Passion**](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0791458164/) by
Frank Visser. That is turning out to be quite an interesting read since
it lays Wilber's work out over the timeline of his writing career and
illustrates how his thought has developed. In the fiction department,
I'm working through [**Absolution
Gap**](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575074345/) by Alastair
Reynolds right now. This finishes up his **Inhibitor** books. After
this, I'll probably read the next Gunslinger book by Stephen King.
