So, this is likely to be a bit of a busy week overall. Wednesday is a dress rehearsal in tux and all for a friend and brother's wedding... The wedding is this Friday night, something that I had kind of spaced out on. Since I've known the friend in question for something like six or seven years now and I'm actually in his wedding party, I'd better keep it straight! Thursday night is the Red Tara empowerment with Lama Tsering. I'm looking forward to this event. My Tibetan religious protocol is rather weak so I'm not always terribly sure when I should be bowing and such but it is getting better. Eventually I won't feel like an idiot. Today I had the misfortune of watching a team video themed on Austin Powers that our interns created last week. Let's just say that acting is not a core competency of most people in the tech industry and leave it at that. Many wincing moments. The Cabiri show on Saturday night seemed to go fairly well. No one tripped, set themselves on fire or otherwise harmed themselves or others. There were no gratuitous screwups that the audience would notice. I'm hoping that we get to do this show again at some point as I think it is a pretty cool one (themed on the Timaeus from Plato). We'll have pictures available soon though I don't know if too many of me in the fish priest (aka the Grand Salmon) will survive. R and I got a lot more stuff unpacked this weekend and I picked up a hub for our network so we're both able to share the DSL easily. Unlike my last DSL provider (who shall remain nameless since I work for them...), Blarg actually gave me detailed instructions on how to set up the Cisco 678 box as a DHCP server so our computers automatically get their IP addresses when they boot and I don't have to run any dorky programs in my system tray. It's quite nice and painless. Sarastro came over last night and we discussed things magical while drinking coffee and eating far too many chocolate covered raisins. I'm hoping that my space for group ritual work will get further along in the basement. We're probably going to hang cloth along the walls to demarcate the space better and to make it feel like more of a ritual space.
