Apparently, my old team has finally released IE7 according to the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/10/18/internet-explorer-7-for-windows-xp-available-now.aspx">blog that I used to run</a>...

Shit, this means that the next release of my product at my new job is going to have to officially suport it!

On another note, my friend and former boss has <a href="http://www.scottstearns.com/archives/000820.html">announced he's leaving the IE team</a> as well. Quite a few of us had worked together for roughly five years so it kind of feels like the world has moved on for a number of us.
