Yesterday, R and I had our first meeting with our mortgage broker. Meeting with a mortgage broker is like being anally probed by a bank. It&apos;s a bit uncomfortable and you get a lot of the attention of the kind that you don&apos;t really like. After going over all of our debts, accounts, paystubs, tax returns, divorce papers and getting a list of things that we need to turn in, we got the huggy love sell of what kind of loan options will be available to use. I want the whole thing to be over. Ack. Luckily, we&apos;ll be putting 10% down on the house and we have closing costs so that should keep things under control. This meeting is to get pre-approved so we can make an offer on a house immediately if we find anything. This evening R and I had a nice dinner at home and watched <b>Cube-2: Hypercube.</b> Interesting concept but the movie stunk. Nothing really original when compared to the first one. Tomorrow, I get to take the afternoon off of work and go see the new Matrix movie. Woohoo!!
