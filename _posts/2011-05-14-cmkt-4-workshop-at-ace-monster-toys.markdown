The circuit-bending rock band, [CMKT 4](http://www.facebook.com/cmkt4)
paid a visit to [Ace Monster Toys](http://www.acemonstertoys.org) this
last Thursday. CMKT4 plays a rather different sort of music, which you
can hear over on their [Reverbnation
page](http://www.reverbnation.com/cmkt4). The guys (Zach, Austin, and
Jeff) rolled up and worked with a bunch of our local monsters on
building contact microphones. This involved taking a piezoelectric
sensor, soldering some leads directly to the crystal element and the
brass border on it, attaching wires, and gluing this into a bottle cap.
The other end of the leads as soldered to a standard audio jack, which
was also put into a bottle cap. Copious amounts of hot glue and a fair
amount of liquid plastic (to seal the sensor) were added to this mix.
You can see some of my pictures below and on my Ace Monster Toys [flickr
set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157626284000644/):

*a completed contact microphone*

Most of us also made a circuit bending device as well, which allows you
to attach leads to interesting points on children's speaking toys to see
where one might attach switches or potentiometers in order to have them
make interesting sounds, which is a mainstay of CMKT 4's music.

CMKT 4 is on a [tour](http://www.getlofi.com/?p=4417) of American
hackerspaces for the month of May, including a visit to Maker Faire in
San Mateo next weekend. They'll be performing on stage there and
visiting various people so I encourage attendees to check them out.
They'll also be selling contact microphones and kits of parts for those
that want to make there own. I've added Dallas Moore's
[video](http://vimeo.com/23583965) from a few days ago about circuit
bending with CMKT4 and Creme Dementia. It definitely gives a feel for
what the guys were showing us and talking about for those that couldn't
make it to the event.
