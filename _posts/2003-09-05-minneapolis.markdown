I fly to Minneapolis in nine hours and 20 minutes. I should go to bed but I'm re-dying my hair purple and it has to set...

This evening I went to the steering committee meeting for Pema Kilaya, the local Buddhist sangha that I'm involved with. We're still debating the pros and cons and then financials of renting a space. It's a good group of people and some of them are quite experienced but it definitely is kind of weird to watch a meeting lurching back and forth as people debate things in a reall weird manner. Since I professionally spend probably three to four hours a day, averaged over a week, in meetings, I think that I can comment on how a quick and professional meeting is done. This isn't to say that it was bad but it definitely wasn't efficient. It's probably not what the steering committee is optimizing for though.

Afterwards, the woman who showed up 45 minutes late and asked a bunch of questions that we'd already spent 45 minutes solving comes up to me and basically tries to convince me to join the steering committee. She seemed to think that I was passionate and knew how to add a lot in meetings or somesuch.

She didn't understand (clearly) when I said "No, that's ok. I decided a while back not to put my head in a vice anymore..."

Buddhists aren't always known for their sense of humor. :-)
