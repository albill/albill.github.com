I just came across this interview with John Yorke by the Julian Doyle. John Yorke is the son of Gerald Yorke. The elder Yorke was a close associate of Aleister Crowley's who produced many of the typescripts of Crowley's texts. He is also the source of the "Gerald Yorke Collection" at the <a href="http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/">Warburg Institute</a> in the UK. This is one of the few public collections of Golden Dawn materials (as well as those of Crowley) and I referenced some of its contents while working on my Master's thesis on the Golden Dawn. Julian Doyle recently directed the over-the-top Crowley-inspired horror movie, <a href="http://www.chemicalweddingmovie.com/">Chemical Wedding</a>.  

As an aside, it is interesting to note that in his later life, after giving up his pursuit of occultism, Gerald Yorke became quite well known as an emissary of the Dalai Lama. 

In this interview, Julian Doyle discusses some of the memorialbilia that John Yorke inherited from his father, including Crowley's magical wand (<em>ahem</em>).
