This made me laugh a lot...

## Non-Euclidean Lego

*Ph-nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.* Bored with
3-dimensional orthogonal Lego constructions? No more! With **Arlington
Wolfe Non-Euclidean Lego** you can build the Cthulhoid contrivances of
your most fevered imagination! No longer must your Lego constructions be
confined to the standard linear spatial dimensions. You can now build
houses with all the angles greater than 90 degrees, to avoid attracting
the Hounds of Tindalos. Put together your very own cyclopean blasphemies
with sanity-sapping geometries. Span immense interstellar gulfs with
nothing more than a handful of 2x4 bricks. Choose from a wide range of
boxed sets, including:

-   **Temple at R'lyeh** Build a replica of the green slimy-vaulted
    temple where [mighty
    Cthulhu](http://www.cis.rit.edu/~jerry/Image/lego/cthulu.html)
    slumbers in the nightmare corpse-city of R'lyeh! Custom**Arlington
    Wolfe Non-Euclidean Lego** pieces recreate the tenebrous qualities
    of the vast, loathsome shapes that seeped down from the stars. The
    abnormal geometries of Gustaf Johansen's dizzying visions of the
    hideous cosmic majesty, the stupefyingly colossal statues, the
    impious and horrible *angles* in the sea-soaked perversions of the
    fantasmally variable carven structures he saw under that insanely
    gibbous moon borne on a gropingly membranous sky are all here for
    you to enjoy. *Iä! Iä! Cthulhu fhtagn!*
-   **The Witch House** The hideous gambrel-roofed house where Walter
    Gilman suffered feverish and febrile dreams of unspeakable evil in a
    room with an oddly slanting floor and sloped walls whose angles do
    not fit into normal space or dimensionality. Complete with a custom
    piece representing the anomolous and monstrously degraded skeleton
    of Brown Jenkin.
-   **Mountains of Madness** Put together the fragments of cyclopean
    masonry which reconstruct the mind-numbingly palaeogean and
    monstrously decadent edifices of the ancient city of the Elder
    Things which lurks near the unfathomed and abhorrent mountains of
    madness in central Antarctica. Create the astonishing arabesque
    traceries of obscurely mathematical and antique psychology with
    which these alien creatures and their demoniac Shoggoths decorated
    their immeasurably detestable nightmare city.
-   **The Whateley House** Recreate this peaked-roofed house with its
    rear buried in the hillside near Dunwich Village. The ground floor
    rooms look normal enough, but hidden in the upper floors are the
    grotesque demon-spawn of Yog-Sothoth!
-   **The House of Erich Zann** The eerie gable-windowed house on the
    unlocatably shadowed and incredibly steep Rue d'Auseil where Erich
    Zann played his frenzied and feverish harmonies, opening vast gulfs
    to the blackness of space illimitable, where chaos and pandemonium
    entered the demon madness of the strange peaked garret to the sound
    of the unutterable music.
-   **Innsmouth** With this monstrous set you can build several entire
    streets of the accursed seaside town of Innsmouth, including the
    ominous hall of the Esoteric Order of Dagon. Recreate the path of
    the unnamed narrator in his horror flight from the Gilman House
    through the streets of Innsmouth, pursued by the hideously shambling
    half-human natives. As a bonus, the pieces in this set can also be
    used to construct the lair of the Deep Ones: Cyclopean and
    many-columned Y'ha-nthlei!

*Ph-nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.* Warning:
**Arlington Wolfe Non-Euclidean Lego** may cause insanity in the
weak-minded.
