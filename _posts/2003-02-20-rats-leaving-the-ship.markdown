It isn't good for the person in question when you see e-mails like this from the head program manager (their boss...):
<blockquote>XXX has left Microsoft to pursue other opportunities. We thank him for his contributions and wish him luck in his new endeavours. Until we hire a replacement, YYY will be the contact for issues XXX was working on.Please direct any questions to me.
Thanks.</blockquote>
XXX was the the program manager for the team that I just got re-org'd into...ack.
