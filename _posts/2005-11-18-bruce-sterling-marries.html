That's weird because, the last I heard, he had a wife and two daughters in Austin. I can only assume that as part of his move to Los Angeles and other life stuff, he must have gotten divorced. When he was out at my work two years ago (or was it even that long) he spoke about his house in Austin and his daughters so it seems recent.
