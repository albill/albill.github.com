I was thinking of a number of conversations that John Michael Greer and I used to have during lodge along with those of a few others. It occured to me that given the limited scope of my MA thesis (probably 60 to 80 pages, double-spaced), that I might have a basic question that could be examined using Philosophy of Religion and the work of current academics of Western Esotericism. As a thesis statement, this could be formulated a lot tighter but I think it works: <strong>Is the Golden Dawn derived ceremonial magic of the 20th century a religion?</strong> I can examine some of the basic definitions of religion, look at the Christian and Jewish cultural milieu of earlier Hermeticism after the Renaissance and then go into the post-Christian Hermeticism of people like Israel Regardie and other figures. I think there is a lot of meat that could be used here. Thoughts?
