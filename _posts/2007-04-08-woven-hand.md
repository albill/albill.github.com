R and I went out this evening with a couple of friends of hers from high school. We went to see the band, "<a href="http://www.soundsfamilyre.com/">Woven Hand</a>," at the <a href="http://www.starryploughpub.com/">Starry Plough</a>, a Berkeley bar.

The band is very much in the vein of Nick Cave in a way. It is very dark and Biblical in a way. He's toured with Nick Cave and Morphine before so his mood shouldn't be surprising.  David Eugene Edwards, the singer, is clearly very Christian but it reminds me more of the mood of the angry and dark Christ, in the desert or attacking the moneylenders.

The music is very good and I highly recommend it. You can hear some of the music on the band's page on <a href="http://www.myspace.com/wovenhandmosaic">myspace</a>. I've put a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157600055276423/">small photoset</a> up on flickr as well.
