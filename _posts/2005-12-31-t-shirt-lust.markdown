R and I saw some t-shirts once, about six months ago, at a local mall when we were doing some other shopping. At the time, I wanted one of the shirts but I didn't feel like spending the money and didn't think it was worth it. Since then, I've wanted the shirt but haven't been able to find it. R and I even stopped by the same place a week and a half ago in order to see if they still have them. They did not. I had hoped to get it for yule but I got the cool (and it is) Cthulhu the Destroyer shirt instead. Today, a package came and it was the shirt! R had tracked it down and ordered it for me. My wife is great! In its full glory: <p align="center">
