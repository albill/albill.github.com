R and I saw some t-shirts once, about six months ago, at a local mall when we  were doing some other shopping. At the time, I wanted one of the shirts but I  didn't feel like spending the money and didn't think it was worth it. Since  then, I've wanted the shirt but haven't been able to find it. R and I even  stopped by the same place a week and a half ago in order to see if they still  have them. They did not. I had hoped to get it for yule but I got the cool (and  it is) Cthulhu the Destroyer shirt instead.

Today, a package came and it was the shirt! R had tracked it down and ordered  it for me. My wife is great!

In its full glory:
