R and I saw some t-shirts once, about six months ago, at a local mall
when we were doing some other shopping. At the time, I wanted one of the
shirts but I didn't feel like spending the money and didn't think it was
worth it. Since then, I've wanted the shirt but haven't been able to
find it. R and I even stopped by the same place a week and a half ago in
order to see if they still have them. They did not. I had hoped to get
it for yule but I got the cool (and it is) Cthulhu the Destroyer shirt
instead. Today, a package came and it was the shirt! R had tracked it
down and ordered it for me. My wife is great! In its full glory:
