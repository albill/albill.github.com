<a href="http://emptygatezen.com/">Empty Gate Zen Center</a> is my local instance of the <a href="http://www.kwanumzen.org/">Kwan Um School of Zen</a>. The lineage that I practice in is ultimately the same as theirs as we are all students of Zen Master Seung Sahn, who founded that school and who died a few years back. Empty Gate has sitting available just about every day but on Wednesday nights, their abbot, Rev. Bon Soeng, gives Dharma talks. In a rare embrace of the 21st century, they actually stream these talks live and often make them available afterwards. Below is Rev. Bon Soeng's talk from May 11, last Wednesday. I've been listening to it and found it to be quite good and definitely in line with how we approach things in the Five Mountain Sangha as well. I recommend listening to it if you have the time and inclination. You can hear it on <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/14642305">ustream</a> or watch it below if you have flash installed and enabled. <p style="text-align: center">
