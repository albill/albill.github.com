I had a member of the local co-masonic lodge over this evening. It was an interesting chat about a variety of topics (revolving around masonry). They have chartered a San Francisco body (near Daly City) and will be officially invested with officers in February (the same weekend as Pantheacon).

I'll be meeting with a couple of other members of this body in the next week or so as well.

On a semi-related masonic note, I managed to get copies of <strong>Heredom</strong> the other day. This is the book produced annually by the Scottish Rite Research Society (of which I am a member). I wish I had the whole set. They publish an interesting mix of essays in each volume every year.
