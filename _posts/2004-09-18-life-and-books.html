<p>I haven&#39;t written as much lately. Work has been a bit scattered over the last 
week. It&#39;s easy to feel like you aren&#39;t accomplishing much when there are so 
many random things to do. It&#39;s kind of funny because some people are convinced 
that I&#39;m the organized, process task-focused guy but I get mired in shit often 
enough that I wonder. We suffer from too many meetings but when you don&#39;t go, 
you find out about the important bit that you just missed in the one your 
skipped. Ah well.</p>
<p>The wedding is two weeks from tomorrow. The first draft of the ritual was 
given to Sam to go over. R went out to the Shumway Mansion and gave them our 
menu. We&#39;ll be paying them tomorrow. We&#39;ve taken care of the photography and R 
arranged for the flowers. I should check on Sam&#39;s reservation but we seem to be 
progressing. We ok&#39;d the rings earlier in the week so they are being cast as we 
speak. In a way, it will be a relief to be finished and on our way to Italy for 
a couple of weeks away from it all. I&#39;m taking a total of three weeks off from 
work, which will be nice. I&#39;ll have time to catch up on the jetlag once we 
return.</p>
<p>I still need to turn in the transcripts for my Master&#39;s program before I go 
but that shouldn&#39;t be too difficult. Just one more task to be done.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve gotten a few books from the library this week (rather than purchasing 
them). I picked up <b>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0262511096">Zen and the 
Brain</a></b> and <b>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0226580245">The 
Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe</a></b>. The latter interfaces with 
my current interest in fifteenth and sixteenth century British history (though 
no pirates! Arr!). The former is one of the first looks, and the first 
comprehensive, on the neurological basis of meditative states. It&#39;s published by 
MIT Press and is huge. The author is a neurologist and a zen practitioner and 
used his skills and interest in one an investigation in what is going on in the 
brain during meditative practice. I flipped through it a bit and it is pretty 
impressive. I might actually have to buy it to keep for the library.</p>
<p>Because of finishing a work task early and quickly (I assume), I received a 
small gift certificate to Amazon. I quickly used it to pick up Paul Di Filippo&#39;s 
recent novel, <b>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1587155079">A Mouthful of 
Tongues: Her Totipotent Tropicanalia</a></b>, which is probably not the most 
work appropriate choice but, hey, I wanted to read it! Soon, I will begin to 
climb Mt. Stephenson again because the third volume of the Baroque cycle should 
be appearing soon.</p>
