I was reading this blog entry today: <a href="http://www.corante.com/loom/archives/2005/06/30/mice_monkeys_and_muttering.php">http://www.corante.com/loom/archives/2005/06/30/mice_monkeys_and_muttering.php</a>

One part stood out in the whole thing:
<blockquote>In 2001 scientists identified a gene involved in spoken language. They found it by studying a Pakistani family in which half the members suffered from a disorder that interfered with their ability to understand grammar and to speak. The scientists tracked the disorder back to a single mutation to a single gene, which is now known as <a href="http://www.corante.com/loom/archives/2005/06/30/%20http://www.corante.com/loom/archives/2003/10/17/from_genes_to_words.php%3Cbr%20/%3E" minmax_bound="true">FOXP2.</a>
<p minmax_bound="true">FOXP2 belongs to a family of genes found in animals and fungi. They all produce proteins that regulate other genes, giving them a powerful role in the development of the body. FOXP2 in particular exists in other mammals, in slightly different forms. In mice, for example, the part of the gene that actually encodes a protein is 93.5% identical to human FOXP2.</p>

The following year another group of scientists compared the human version of FOXP2 to the sequence in our close primate relatives. They found that chimpanzees have a version of the gene that's hardly different from the gene in mice. But in our own lineage, FOXP2 underwent some fierce natural selection. By comparing the minor differences in FOXP2 carried by different people, the scientists were able to estimate when that natural selection took place--roughly 100,000 years ago. That's about the time when archaeological evidence suggests that humans began using language. (For a good review of all this work, go <a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/dm/foxp2.pdf" minmax_bound="true">here</a>.)</blockquote>
Having just finished <strong>Maelstrom</strong> by Peter Watts, I'm thinking about apocalypse and death scenarios along with people messing with other people's genetics, brain chemistry, and conditioning.
What would happen if you took an adult (or non-child) human and used a retrovirus to damage/change their FOXP2 gene? If it was done to a child or during pregnancy, I assume that speech would probably never develop, just as what happened in the Pakistani family above. What would happen to an adult if suddenly they lost their ability to speak, perhaps even to think in words?

The question that comes to me immediately after this is "Would anyone do this to themselves on purposes?" I could see a certain kind of religious or social group deciding that existence without language was more immediate and primal and doing this to themselves. They'd still be tool users after all.
Interesting.
