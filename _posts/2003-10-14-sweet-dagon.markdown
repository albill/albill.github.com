Baby's First Mythos

Spawned from the mind of horror king and Origins award winner, C.J.
Henderson, \
 ("The Things That Are Not There," "Tales of Inspector Legrasse") this
book is a fun-filled must for every Lovecraftian everywhere. Lavishly
illustrated with dozens of all new, highly detailed pieces by the
incomparable Erica Henderson, this is one of those rare instant classics
that everyone is simply going to have to have on their shelf. This book
will blast your child's soul as you teach them their ABCs - Mythos
style!

 **D is for Dagon, \
 Because he's one of the gods,\
 And not for the Deep Ones,\
 Who're just one step up from frogs.**

**A is for Azathoth,\
 Who dwells in the center,\
 Dreaming us from a place, \
 That we cannot enter.**
