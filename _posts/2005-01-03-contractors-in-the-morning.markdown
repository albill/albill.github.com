I woke up this morning (and the wife did) to an 8:00 AM phone call. It's
the contractor, who was going to come Wednesday, saying his three day
job got cancelled and would I like him to fix my ceiling and wall in the
bathroom today?

We said "Yes!" I have the day off as MS gave me today off for New Year's
instead of Friday. This means that I won't have to miss a morning of
work on Wednesday, which is good.

Since he's here, I had him look at the dishwasher problem briefly. It
looks like the shutoff for it from the sink is rusted open too. :-)

So, when he gets done in the bathroom (he's been here and hour or so and
is about done), we'll probably turn off the water to the house and try
to disconnect things. Getting a professional to look at the floor damage
while he's already here (saving a trip and minimum fee) seems like a
good idea. I'd like to get the dishwasher pulled out anyway. He thinks
that if the damage isn't extensive, it's probably easy to fix the
plywood flooring though. We'll see once it is exposed.
