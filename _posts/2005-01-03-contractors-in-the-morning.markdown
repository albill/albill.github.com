<p>I woke up this morning (and the wife did) to an 8:00 AM phone call. It&#39;s the 
contractor, who was going to come Wednesday, saying his three day job got 
cancelled and would I like him to fix my ceiling and wall in the bathroom today?</p>
<p>We said &quot;Yes!&quot; I have the day off as MS gave me today off for New Year&#39;s 
instead of Friday. This means that I won&#39;t have to miss a morning of work on 
Wednesday, which is good.</p>
<p>Since he&#39;s here, I had him look at the dishwasher problem briefly. It looks 
like the shutoff for it from the sink is rusted open too. :-)</p>
<p>So, when he gets done in the bathroom (he&#39;s been here and hour or so and is 
about done), we&#39;ll probably turn off the water to the house and try to 
disconnect things. Getting a professional to look at the floor damage while he&#39;s 
already here (saving a trip and minimum fee) seems like a good idea. I&#39;d like to 
get the dishwasher pulled out anyway. He thinks that if the damage isn&#39;t 
extensive, it&#39;s probably easy to fix the plywood flooring though. We&#39;ll see once 
it is exposed.</p>
