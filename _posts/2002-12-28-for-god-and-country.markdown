I'm off soon to go play a minor role that my little lodge, the <a href="http://www.ogdoadic.com/ouroboros/">Citadel of the Ouroboros</a>, is playing at <a href="http://www.oloteas.org/announce.asp#79">Concentric Circles</a> today. This is a local pagan community event. We did a ritual last year, not terribly complex but with lots of people attending, and got asked back this year. We decided to do something much smaller this time.  got suckered into leading it as the senior member of the group (and because I did it last year).

Technically, I can get into the whole event for free but I find that there really isn't much on the calendar that I am interested in attending. I'll meander out there eventually.

Our lodge ("citadel") maintains a small internal website (quite protected, thank you) and I've been doing a lot of work on cleaning it up and updating it this week. I've let it moulder over the last year to year and a half since we shifted our focus heavily into Ogdoadic work. I should also be putting the Archon rituals that I wrote for the elements up on <a href="http://www.ogdoadic.com">Ogdoadic.com</a> soon. They are simple invocations of the Archons (the archangels of our tradition) associated with the elements and using the platonic solids as a ritual focus but I like them.
