This last weekend, R and I were looking for something to do together. I
recalled that there is a labyrinth locally in a state park and suggested
that we hike out to it. One thing that isn't readily apparent when you
live in the Bay Area is how close some fairly large parks are to the
urban areas. R has been making a point of hiking these during the last
couple of years but I haven't seen most of them. The labyrinth is in the
Sibley Volcanic Regional Preserve, a large park in the hills behind
Oakland about fifteen minutes away from my house. It spans the tops of
the hills that separate the coast from the more arid inland areas. The
labyrinth is in an old quarry (looking like a small canyon) about twenty
or so minutes hike in if you know where you are going. If you don't know
where you are going, as was the case with us, it can take you about an
hour to find. You can see the labyrinth clearly on [Google
Maps](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Sibley+Volcanic+Regional+Preserve,+Orinda,+CA+94563&sll=37.85019,-122.283831&sspn=0.013995,0.018518&ie=UTF8&hq=Sibley+Volcanic+Regional+Preserve&hnear=Sibley+Volcanic+Regional+Preserve,+Orinda,+CA+94563&ll=37.85298,-122.190434&spn=0.000875,0.001157&t=h&z=20)
if you zoom in on the park and know where to look.

The Labyrinth from the Overlook
The Labyrinth was created by by Helena Mazzariello during the spring
equinox of 1990. It is a classical (or 7-circuit), left-handed, earthen
labyrinth with the lines set out in pieces of local rock. The term,
"labyrinth," dates from Greek legends of Crete and the labyrinth there
with its minotaur at the center. As has been pointed out by some, a
[labyrinth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth) is not a maze (even
though the one in the legend is...) in that there is a single, clearly
defined path within a labyrinth that leads in winding fashion from the
center of the labyrinth to the center. They are seen by many to be
sacral constructions that one walks as a form of meditation or
pilgrimage. I've known many people that made a practice of labyrinth
walking, at least on occasion. They have been used by both non-Christian
traditions in Europe and the Middle East (and, separately, in
pre-contact North America). Grace Cathedral in San Francisco has a
well-known labyrinth that I've still never visited:

Given my pagan and esoteric background, I'm quite at home with the idea
of labyrinth walking.

When we arrived, the location was overcast, with fog nearby. R and I
were alone in the space so, after a few photos, we took the opportunity
to walk the labyrinth (and its tiny neighbor) while listening to the
frogs. It was a bit water logged in places but it is clear that we were
far from the only recent visitors, given the objects left in shrine-like
fashion at the center of the main labyrinth.

I've put a very small [photo
set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157623000503955/)
online. There is a
[page](http://home.earthlink.net/~friendsofthelabyrinth/) devoted to the
"Friends of the Labyrinth" as well, who attempt to keep it maintained
and protected.
