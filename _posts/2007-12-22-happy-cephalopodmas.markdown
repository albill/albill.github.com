want to wish everyone a [Happy
Cephalopodmas!](http://www.cephalopodmas.com/) To celebrate the season,
I offer a carol for you from the **[HPLHS Solstice Carol
Songbook](http://www.cthulhulives.org/Solstice/)**.

> ## [It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like
> Fish-Men](http://www.cthulhulives.org/Solstice/fish-menplayer.html)
>
> It's beginning to look a lot like fish-men Everywhere I go; From the
> minute I got to town And started to look around I thought these
> ill-bred people's gillslits showed. I'm beginning to hear a lot of
> fish-men Right outside my door, As I try to escape in fright To the
> moonlit Innsmouth night I can hear some more. They speak with guttural
> croaks and to hear them provokes A profound desire to flee Their eyes
> never blink and quite frankly they stink Like a carcass washed up from
> the sea. I wish I'd paid attention to that crazy drunken man. He tried
> to warn me all about old Marsh's Deep One clan. It's beginning to look
> a lot like Fish-men Everywhere I go; They can dynamite Devil Reef, but
> that'll bring no relief, Y'ha N'thlei is deeper than they know. I'll
> continue to see a lot of fish-men That I guarantee. For the fish-man I
> really fear is the one who's in the mirror And he looks like me. He
> looks just like me.
