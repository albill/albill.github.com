<strong>Humanity, New and Improved</strong>

Advocates of high tech-no, make that advocates of really, really high tech-have a gleam in their eye, a plan in their back pocket, and perhaps the political skills to get it funded.

The plan, kicking around the National Science Foundation, can be seen as both visionary and unnerving. It's visionary in that it seeks to "converge" three of the most promising technologies of the age-information technology, biotechnology, and nanotechnology-and it's unnerving in that it predicts that these technologies can improve and enhance basic biological functions to create a new type of human being. In the high-flying rhetoric of the draft being shopped around, the plan "could achieve a golden age.... [in which] the twenty-first century could end in world peace, universal prosperity, and evolution to a higher level of compassion and accomplishment.... [and] humanity would become like a single, distributed and interconnected `brain.' "

The plan, in draft-report form, can be seen at the National Science Foundation's Web site, www.nsf.gov. Titled "Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance," the report includes numerous articles and speeches outlining possible benefits from the new convergence research. The plan was prepared by Mihail Roco, a senior adviser at the National Science Foundation, in cooperation with the Commerce Department's senior adviser for technology, John Sargent, and numerous other scientists in government, industry, and various research centers.

The plan urges better direction and more spending over the three technologies, particularly in nanotechnology-which focuses on building machinery that's extremely small, so small, in fact, that each of a machine's components may consist of a few molecules.

The report also calls for the creation of a new, top- priority technology program, dubbed the "Human Cognome Project." This is modeled on the Human Genome Project, in which federal and private-sector researchers rushed to finish the first complete list of the genetic data in a human cell by June 2000. The proposed "cognome" project would be intended to "understand the structure, functions, and potential enhancement of the human mind."

The overall convergence plan would be implemented in close coordination with foreign scientists who work in countries that are economic competitors-Japan, South Korea, and France, in particular.

The plan builds on Roco's success during the Clinton administration, when he drafted a plan for managing the government's diverse nanotechnology programs, which were then funded at just under $300 million per year. Roco's effort, which President Clinton eventually championed, has boosted nanotechnology spending in 2002 beyond $600 million, and his efforts are now backed by several influential universities, including the California Institute of Technology, as well as by such industry coalitions as the NanoBusiness Alliance, based in New York City.

The new convergence project will likely be funded, too, said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a supporter of the plan. Within the next 10 years, it will yield new technologies "fully as dramatic as the Internet," he said.

Several obstacles may stand in the plan's way, however. The first is the looming budget crunch brought on by the war on terror and the multi-year tax cuts. Still, Congress seems ready to spend more than $700 million on the 2003 nanotech program. And in June the House voted, 397-25, to pass the Investing in America's Future Act. The act authorizes a 60 percent increase in the National Science Foundation's budget over three years. On September 5, meanwhile, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee voted to authorize a doubling of the NSF's budget over five years.

Advocates for the convergence plan include many scientists, universities, and companies focused on engineering, math, information technology, and other hard sciences, that have seen their share of the federal research budget stagnate as Congress has boosted funding for medical research through the National Institutes of Health.

A second obstacle to Roco's draft plan is that it must gain approval from many levels of the bureaucracy, including the powerful Office of Management and Budget. The strategy, said Roco, is to work from the bottom upward. First stop: John H. Marburger, director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy; then the technology committee at the National Science and Technology Council, and then, maybe, President Bush. The process will take two or three years, Roco predicted.

Some progress already is being made. For example, the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology has drafted a letter to Bush urging greater federal support for engineering and other non-biotech sciences. Marburger co-chairs the council along with Floyd Kvamme, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist with Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, a firm that owns portions of many high-tech companies. The council's support is very important in the campaign to win backing from the OMB, said Robert S. Boege, executive director of the Washington-based Alliance for Science & Technology Research in America.

The third obstacle will likely be protests from those on both the right and the left who fear that the scientists' ambitions edge too close to the notion that the commercial marketplace will determine human characteristics. Such a notion leaves little room for the role of personal character and the nation's egalitarian and democratic values in "improving human performance." The report "strikes me as just the latest version of the misplaced effort to treat human beings as lab rats," said Eric Cohen, a scholar at the right-of-center Washington-based Ethics and Public Policy Center and a part-time adviser to the President's Council on Bioethics. The scientists "fashion themselves as beyond politics, but ... they are trying to shape human outcomes, to engineer culture in certain ways," he said. The scientists' desire for precision also "misses all the complexity and ambiguity of human life, and therefore the need for the prudence that should govern all political activity."

The convergence project also gets criticism from people to the left of center, including Bill Joy, the chief scientist at Sun Microsystems, a major Silicon Valley computer firm. In an April 2000 article in Wired, titled "Why the Future Doesn't Need Us," he argued that the convergence technologies could escape human control and create new forms of rapidly evolving life that would destroy humanity. However, Joy declined to comment on the convergence plan, saying, "I am in a blackout on this subject for the moment."

The NSF report acknowledges some of these potential political and ethical issues. "These new technologies will enable us to decipher the fundamental mechanisms of a living being," the draft plan says, but will "raise the fundamental questions of what life is and how human capability is defined."

Convergence technology "will raise enormous challenges," Gingrich agreed. "How much do we really want to know about how the brain works? What if we discover there are certain patterns you have that are destructive, that we could change, but in the process of changing them, you feel less human than you used to be?"

The answer, he said, is that "the human race stumbles forward, from the discovery of fire onwards, recognizing that every kind of power has its downside." Congress can and will respond to excesses, as it already has, he said, in placing curbs on genetic engineering and on nuclear power, and in banning the birth of human clones.

Roco, too, said that human enhancements can be done responsibly. "We try to facilitate and guide [developments] to be sure this is done by responsible persons," said Roco, who will soon promote the plan in several speeches overseas. "The core objective is to improve the human condition," he said. The project would seek to protect human rights and personal privacy by letting individuals decide whether they would use the technologies for human enhancement, Roco added. As the converging technologies make their way into the marketplace, the government should protect "the right of each individual to advance" and the right of people not to use the new technology, said Roco. Of course, "in any development, you have winners, and sometimes people who do not gain so much," but the government can help balance the rights of individuals and groups and "the need for progress," he said.

Because the research will focus on improvements that can be made to individual humans, instead of to machines such as computers, "humanity will be extended by this evolution" and will be better able to manage the various new types of technologies, he said.

Central to the convergence program is the "cognome" project. One element of the project would seek to identify-just as geneticists did the individual genes in DNA passed down from human to human through evolution-the separate cognitive and behavioral patterns of thinking passed down to generations of humans through culture. Such a study could improve human productivity, says the plan, because "in the `information society' of the twenty-first century, the most valuable resource will not be iron or oil but culture."

This approach is often called "memetics," with each individual "meme" being a strand of human thinking, according to an article authored by two NSF managers, Gary Strong and William Bainbridge. While "it may be vain to hope that all people can eventually come to share compatible religious beliefs.... [with memetics] we could help people find the culture they want and we could locate `uninhabited' cultural territories that could profitably be colonized." One whimsical example offered by Bainbridge would be a "memetic map" that could point to a lack of musical products that combine Gregorian chant, say, with rhythm and blues.

Critics, however, are skeptical of this vision of human enhancement. The convergence theorists' hubris, according to Cohen, "is to believe they can do this on totally objective scientific facts." Skilled social science recognizes the limits on what humans can know about other humans, he said. "We've seen that temptation in eugenics proposals" that sought to breed in, or breed out, certain hereditary traits and were endorsed by the Supreme Court before World War II, he said. Under the eugenics laws, which endured to the 1970s, experts identified people deemed unfit to be parents, and government agencies sterilized some and placed others in insane asylums.

Roco acknowledged that the NSF plan is not yet in its final form, but, he said, "the major ideas will not be changed."
