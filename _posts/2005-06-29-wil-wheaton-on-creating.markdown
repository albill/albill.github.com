<p><a href="http://www.wilwheaton.net/">Will Wheaton</a> responds to fan questions on <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> today. One answer from him stood out in particular as well said so I wanted to share it:</p>
<blockquote><h2>How to be a &quot;real&quot; actor/writer/speaker/artist?</h2>
				<p><i>Hi Wil. I know you're not about dwelling 
				in the past when it comes to your acting career, but I did want 
				to say that I think &quot;Young Harry Houdini [imdb.com]&quot; is an 
				oft-overlooked film that you should be very proud of. Okay, so 
				maybe I was only like 10 when I saw it, but as an amateur 
				magician it really had an effect on me, and I thank you for your 
				role in it.</i> </p>
				<p><i>A related question then: What advice can you give (beyond 
				saying &quot;be born with raw talent&quot;) to folks like yourself who see 
				themselves as creative types with an interest in acting, 
				writing, speaking - the public arts, if you will - but who also 
				don't want to tread the over-worn path of mainstream media and 
				every other Hollywood actor-wannabe? You seem to have done an 
				exceptional job being a part of the underculture - sci-fi TV, 
				self-publishing, blogging, small theater, etc., so it would seem 
				you have some insight into how to participate in these arts 
				without becoming corrupted by the process of getting involved.</i>
				</p> <Lj-cut text="Read the answer...">
				<p><b>WW:</b> Thanks for your kind words about Young Harry 
				Houdini. I am very proud of that film, and I think it's a shame 
				that Disney hasn't released it on DVD. It's a great little 
				movie. </p>
				<p>A very quick story about working on that film: I had several 
				scenes with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001207/">Jose 
				Ferrer</a>. He played a snake oil salesman who I (as Erich 
				Weiss) traveled with around the Old West. During the journey, 
				Erich discovers that he's got <i>real</i> magical powers, which 
				he uses to eventually become Harry Houdini.</p>
				<p>We were filming a scene that took place late at night, around 
				a campfire. Near the end of the scene, Jose was supposed to get 
				up from the fire and walk into the wagon that all of our 
				characters used to get from city to city. Well, during one take, 
				someone forgot a line or something early on in the scene. So 
				Jose stood up, and ad-libbed something like, &quot;Well, I'm off to 
				bed! Good night!&quot; As he walked into the wagon. The director cut 
				the scene, and when Jose came out of the wagon he said, &quot;I'm so 
				sorry, my dear, but there was a long silence, and I felt 
				compelled to fill it.&quot; </p>
				<p>At that moment, I learned how important it was to be <i>
				present</i> in a scene, even if I wasn't talking, and when to 
				fill the silence, or just let it hang there. To this day, 
				whenever there's a silence in a scene, I feel compelled to fill 
				it.</p>
				<p>The short answer to your question is: Create something, and 
				release it yourself. You don't need anyone's permission, and the 
				traditional rules about distribution just don't apply anymore.</p>
				<p>The long answer to you question is: First, create something 
				for yourself. You asked about acting, but this applies to a 
				book, a 'zine, a website, a web-comic, a short film . . . 
				whatever. Don't wait for someone else to give you something to 
				do, or give you permission to do it. Just create something that 
				you are passionate about.</p>
				<p>Go ahead, I'll wait. </p>
				<p>Okay. Most of this answer is going to apply to writing, 
				because it's where I've had the most experience in doing it 
				myself vs. doing it the traditional way, but it's easily applied 
				to creating in other mediums. Here is the most important thing I 
				can tell you: <i>You do not need the so-called traditional 
				channels of distribution to get your work to an audience, and 
				you'll probably be happier and more successful by </i>not<i> 
				going through those channels.</i> I've done it both ways, and 
				self-publishing and distributing was more fun, more creatively 
				satisfying, and much more financially rewarding than the 
				indescribably frustrating process of doing it the other way. 
				This is the best advice I ever got from a fellow author, and I'm 
				thrilled I can pass it along:&quot;Nobody is going to work as hard as 
				you are to promote and sell your work. Books sell as well as 
				their authors promote them, and don't expect anything from your 
				publisher after the book is turned in.&quot;</p>
				<p>When I wrote <i>Dancing Barefoot</i>, I had a lot of the 
				concerns I think you're referring to in your question: I just 
				wanted to create something, and give it to an audience. I didn't 
				want to experience the same process of begging and rejection, 
				ultimately culminating in some form of (what often feels like) 
				selling big parts of my soul that I have experienced my whole 
				life as an actor. I knew that there was an audience for my work, 
				and because of The Internets, I had a way to reach them. So I 
				learned all I could about self-publishing, asked lots of people 
				lots of stupid and not-so-stupid questions, and came up with a 
				way to publish, market and distribute my work on my own terms. 
				This had a couple of huge benefits, that should appeal to any 
				creative person: I could let the <i>audience</i> decide if the 
				material was worthwhile or not, and I had complete control over 
				the way my work (and by extension, I) was presented to the 
				audience. When I went the &quot;traditional&quot; way, I didn't have that 
				control, and it was endlessly frustrating. O'Reilly insisted, 
				against my advice, on marketing my story as a Star Trek book, 
				which it clearly is not. I warned that they would alienate an 
				enormous potential audience of non-Trekkies with that plan, but 
				my pleadings fell on deaf ears. Unfortunately I was right, 
				(Barnes and Noble won't even stock <i>Just A Geek</i> I've never 
				seen it in a single store. According to a store manager, &quot;Star 
				Trek books just don't sell after the first week.&quot;) <i>Just A 
				Geek</i> was abandoned shortly after its release just before 
				Christmas, no less before it ever got a chance to take off. I 
				worked on that book for two years, and poured ten times more 
				energy into it than I put into <i>Dancing Barefoot</i>, and I 
				was rewarded with a frustrating, depressing experience that I 
				will never repeat. </p>
				<p>It goes back to the advice my friend gave me: As a creative 
				person, whether you're an author, musician, actor or filmmaker, 
				you will end up working harder than anyone else to promote your 
				work, despite the promises they make to you before the contracts 
				are signed. So why give up creative control and an enormous 
				share of the profits when you're going to do most of the work 
				anyway? Why bust your ass to make someone else rich? There isn't 
				a stigma attached to self-publishing (or performing in a small 
				theater, or distributing your performance on DVD via the 
				Internet) like there used to be, because more and more people 
				are coming to understand that the audience is an enormous 
				collection of little niches, and every single one of them can be 
				served by small presses or indie distributors. So if you don't 
				want to participate in the soul-crushing aspects of the 
				entertainment industry, you don't have to. Self-publishing (or 
				self-producing or distributing, or whatever) is risky, but it's 
				the best way to participate in the arts without being corrupted 
				by the process of being involved. Of course, you must have some 
				inherent talent to create good work, but your question implies 
				that you've already got that part of it worked out. I'm trying 
				to show you how you can take your talent, use it to create 
				something, and then take your creation to an audience. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>You want to publish a book? It's easier than ever to 
					create an e-book with free software like Scribus and 
					OpenOffice.org, and use a service like PayPalDownloads to 
					deliver it. 
					</li>
					<li>You want to release your music? Garageband will host 
					your files and connect you with people who want to hear you. 
					</li>
					<li>You have a great idea for a play? There are 99 seat 
					Equity-waiver theaters in every big city in America. 
					</li>
					<li>Don't want to shop your brilliant short film to myopic 
					studio buyers who are just going to steal your idea anyway? 
					Produce it yourself! Film it on digital video, edit it on 
					your Mac, and create your own DVDs. 
					</li>
					<li>When you've got a physical product to sell, PayPal will 
					process payments for you and create shipping labels you can 
					print, or you can use a service like Yahoo Shopping to do 
					your fulfillment. </li>
				</ul>
				If you've got passion, you believe in yourself, and you're 
				willing to take financial risks, you don't need anyone's 
				permission to release your work. Your success or failure won't 
				be left in the hands of anyone else. <i>You</i> are in charge, 
				and you'll sink or swim based upon <i>your</i> efforts. I'll 
				repeat, as the voice of experience: <i>You do not need the 
				so-called traditional channels of distribution to get your work 
				to an audience, and you'll probably be happier and more 
				successful by </i>not<i> going through those channels. </i></blockquote>
