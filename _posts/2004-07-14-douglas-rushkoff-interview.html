<p>Related to Grant Morrison by an oblique angle, there is a new Douglas 
Rushkoff interview up online today as well. I really enjoy his work, I must say.
<b>Ecstasy Club</b> was quite enjoyable and <b>Coercian</b> should be required 
reading for all magicians and free thinkers in this culture.</p>

	<p><i>There's no utopia at the end of the road, but there's certainly some 
	dangerous gutters on the sides. So yeah, I definitely want to help us avert 
	disaster by showing people they can put their hands on the wheel. But it has 
	more to do with bringing people into basic awareness. There's too few people 
	engaged in reality creation right now, and this has led to some disastrous 
	oversimplifications. The more perspectives that come into play, the more 
	resolved picture we can get.</i></p>
