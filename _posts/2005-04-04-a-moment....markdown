Apparantly, my friend, 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <a href="http://www.scottstearns.com">Scott</a>, feels that I "had a moment" on Friday with <a href="http://www.khephra.org/archives/2005/04/questions_quest.php">my entry</a> then. His other comment was along the lines of a Keanu Reeves moment, "Whoa." I'm not sure what that is supposed to mean though he did ask me if my wife was out that evening.
