I'm sitting in Sea-Tac airport right now waiting for my flight back to Oakland. I've had a good visit over the last few days but did not have the time to see everyone that I wanted to see. R and I will have to come up together sometime in the next few months to see people. I'll post more tomorrow when I'm not using a Treo to do it.
