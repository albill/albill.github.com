I received my final acceptance letter for the [Graduate Theological
Union](http://www.gtu.edu) today for their PhD program. I am accepted to
enroll for Fall 2009. W00t! How I will do so and not bankrupt myself
remains a bit of a mystery but a friend pointed out a year or so ago,
when I had put off applying to the program out of fears related to
funding, that making decisions based on fear is not really a good way to
go about life (my wife has recently said the same thing and she's now in
a multi-year homeopathy program). I decided to embrace the fear, apply,
and then work it out to the best of my ability. I hope to keep working
at Mozilla doing QA on Firefox and other projects or contributing in
other ways. I've spoken to a few others there about it and they've been
completely supportive. The next conversation will be with my boss and
the Engineering VP. Internet Geekery is a core love of mine and I've
been on the net since ye olde days of the 1980's and it certainly is
more fulfilling than working in the GTU library as a grad student. I
hope it works out. The first two years of the program will be the
roughest, from what I can tell, where I do most of the initial prepatory
work for my thesis. This is also when I have to master enough of
probably two languages (with one expected to be Japanese) to pass a
translation examination. I know of at least one nameless individual who
stated that it took him/her more than ten tries for one of the
languages. I don't have a good idea of what to expect. I hope to pick
the brains of a few GTU graduates when chance allows for it. As an
aside, one suggestion that Dr. Payne at the Institute of Buddhist
Studies made at one point is since I have five years of childhood
Russian and there was a pre-Revolution body of academic work on Buddhism
in Russia, that I might want to consider trying to study this ossified
body of knowledge. That seems a bit out there though. In any case, it is
a time of change coming up. *Notice the properly placed comma in the
title of post. That's right, I did make it through graduate school for
my MA!*
