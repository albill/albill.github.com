I took the P'Howa empowerment this evening and the Wrathful Guru
Rinpoche empowerment yesterday from Tulku Loga Rinpoche, the head of the
Kathok Monastery in Tibet. In the last year, I've taken formal Refuge
via H.H. Jigdal Dagchen Sakya Rinpoche at the Sakya Monastery. I've
received the following empowerments:

-   **The Green Tara Empowerment** from Her Eminence Dagmola Jamyang
    Sakya
-   **The Red Tara Empowerment** from Lama Tsering Everest of the
    Chagdud Gonpa. This is from the terma discovered by Apong Terton.
-   **The Medicine Buddha Empowerment** from H.H. Jigdal Dagchen Sakya
    Rinpoche.
-   **The White Manjushri Empowerment** from Acharya Lama Gursam
-   **The Wrathful Guru Rinpoche Empowerment** (Guru Drakpo) from Tulku
    Loga Rinpoche. This is from the terma discovered by Rigdzin Longsal
    Nyingpo.
-   **The Amitabha P'howa Empowerment** from Tulku Loga Rinpoche. This
    is from the terma discovered by Rigdzin Longsal Nyingpo.

This is the sum total of my Buddhist empowerments. I feel the most
immediate connection with Red Tara and that practice but it is also the
empowerment with the fullest sadhana (and commentary) that I've taken. I
feel a lot of pull towards the Wrathful Guru Rinpoche empowerment but
there is no practice text available yet for it. It's still being
translated. I still quite like the atmosphere at Chagdud Gonpa Amrita.
It seems to be a much more diverse crowd than some Dharma centers. I
have noticed something a bit annoying about Tibetan Buddhist Dharma
Centers though. There is no greeter or "help the newbie" person **at
all**. In any church, pagan or even OTO open event, somebody official
would be watching for people who were obviously confused or didn't know
how things worked and would both welcome them and give them some basic
pointers. I've seen a lot of "Do this when people do this in ritual"
instruction at the Gnostic Mass or open circles. At Buddhist events,
everyone seems to assume that everyone there is an expert already. There
was an obviously lost fellow there this evening, which brought it home.
No one has ever bothered to show me how to enter a shrine room
correctly, how to prostrate, what to do with that saffron water, etc. I
had to figure it out for myself by watching and by references in a few
books. Hell, Sam Webster told me more about Tibetan Buddhist protocol in
his practices that borrow from Buddhism than any Buddhist has in
person... Anyway, that's just an annoyance.
