Rev. Barry Briggs has an
[update](http://www.oxherding.com/my_weblog/2010/10/eido-shimano-update.html)
on his blog on the Zen Studies Society and Eido Shimano for those still
keeping track. He notes that the official retirement date for Eido
Shimano from his controversial role as abbot has been moved up to
December 8, 2010 but that Shimano will still be giving official
teachings after this date **and** is offering jukai to people next
month. Not exactly the role that one expects for an abbot accused of
decades long sexual predation on his way out of an organization. I
encourage people to read [Rev.
Briggs'](http://www.oxherding.com/my_weblog/2010/10/eido-shimano-update.html)
post and comment there. I'm, personally, pretty tired of the seeming
lack of moral strength on the part of the ZSS board to, at the very
least, remove Shimano from all active and public roles given the
strength of the accusations against him, at the very least. It makes it
hard to take the organization seriously as a source of the Dharma or any
real wisdom.
