So, I went to Latin 103 tonight. I scoped out the new building in
Fremont, went and got some food, and then went to the coffe shop to
study for a while and review old chapters. At the appointed time, I go
into the school and look at the board to figure out where my class is
meeting. A couple of staff members look at me and say "Are you here for
a class?" I say, "Yep, Latin 103." They then say, "Class doesn't start
until Thursday..." **Doh!** So much for reading the calendar correctly.
What makes this extremely dorky is that I did the exact same thing last
quarter too...
