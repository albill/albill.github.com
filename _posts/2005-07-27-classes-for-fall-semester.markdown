I have registered for my fall term at HUX. I'm being allowed to apply the first to my area of study. 

The websites are f'ugly but they contain a relatively recent version of the class information.

<a href="http://www.csudh.edu/hux/syllabi/542/">HUX 542 - THE PARA-RATIONAL PERSPECTIVE</a>
<a href="http://www.csudh.edu/hux/syllabi/544/">HUX 544 - THE INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETY</a>

For Winter term, I should be designing an indepdent study to engage with some of the current, academic scholarship on Western Esotericism.

Current provisional idea for my thesis is to possibly look at the Sphere Group of the Golden Dawn. Backup ideas are still relating to aspects of Masonry and Rosicrucianism.
