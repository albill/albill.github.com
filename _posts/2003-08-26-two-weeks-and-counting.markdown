In two weeks, I fly to Minneapolis to take the next step with the Astrum
Sophia. I'm pretty excited about that and looking forward to seeing a
lot of people that I haven't seen since **last** September. Then I come
back for two days and immediately turn around and fly to the East Coast
for a week to attend a retreat with Namkhai Norbu and the Dzogchen
Community. I've been doing some prepatory reading around that as well
and I'm looking forward to making a more in-person connection to that
tradition and its practice. Then I come back for a week and a half and R
and I will then go down to the Bay Area to attend *Twilight Gathering*
with Sam Webster and that whole crew of malcontents. I'm kind of
overwhelmed with how busy September will be. October will be a month of
rest except that R and I plan to start some kind of yoga together
then....
