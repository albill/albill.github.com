A project that I am working on (to be announced later) would benefit from my extracting a chunk of articles from Wikipedia. The license on the project page where this stuff would appear matches Wikipedia's GPL one so, as far as I know, I simply need to attribute each and every article to its original source article on Wikipedia. The problem, other than sticking such things in, is that MediaWiki seems to only give a mechanism for extracting articles one by one. If you're doing something on the order of 150 articles or so, this would become massively tedious. If anyone knows of a tool or a process to make extracting articles from Wikipedia for use elsehwhere (on another MediaWiki specifically), I'd love to hear about it.
