The world seems to be discovering old meditation aids...I have used one
of these before but not the snazzy modern kind.

> The Nadachair and Slouchbuster are based on the ropes that Tibetan
> monks use to sit upright for hours on end when meditating. The monks
> use these ropes between their knees and back to help them stay
> upright. The Slouchbuster is a small, much more elegant version than
> ropes. The Nadachair is a larger version.

> allows me to sleep and survive 19-22 hours of crowded coach seats. I
> use the Slouchbuster when I travel because:\
> (1) It is very small. It is the size of a paperback book when folded
> up.\
> (2) It folds up and then zips up inside itself. It is totally self
> contained. No bags or anything needed.

> I also own a Nadachair, too, which I keep at work. I use that a couple
> times a day to keep my back straight. I write software for a living,
> so I'm sitting for hours on end. It really makes a difference,
> especially if you have any sort of lower back problems (like me). I
> owned them for a couple of years now and I found that I no longer need
> a monthly chiropractor visit. So it has paid for itself within a
> month.
