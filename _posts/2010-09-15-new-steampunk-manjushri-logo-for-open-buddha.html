A Buddhist and artist that I know from twitter, <a href="http://thekamikazen.com/">the Kamikazen</a>, designed a new logo for my blog today. You can see <a href="http://thekamikazen.com/2010/09/15/steampunk-dharma/">his post</a> on it (as "Steampunk Dharma"). He's also making t-shirts of it <a href="http://www.redbubble.com/people/thekamikazen/t-shirts/5916251-1-steampunk-manjushri">available as well</a>.

The full version can be seen below. It is a steampunk Manjushri, which fits very well with the byline of the blog of "Open Source Buddhism, Technology, and Geekery."

<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/4994073544/" title="Steampunk Manjushri - Large by albill, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4153/4994073544_8095cfea45.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="Steampunk Manjushri - Large" /></a></p>

For those unfamiliar with Manjushri, I recommend the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manjushri">wikipedia article</a> on him. He is often considered the embodiment of praj침캐, which is the wisdom of the praj침캐paramita texts, foundational to Mahayana Buddhism. 

You can read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk">steampunk</a> as well but it is, essentially, a literary, fashion, artistic, and gaming movement that re-imagines the pre-World War I industrial age as it should have been or in a fantastical way reflecting our current values and viewpoint from a post-Industrial age. (It has also been called, "What happens when goths discover brown.") There is a lot of fiction being written that is steampunk and a lot of makers (like the people at my hackerspace) make steampunkesque gadgets with brass, gearing, and lots of welding. My monthly gaming group is playing a 19th century steampunk game as well as the crew of an airship.

So, all in all, I think it is a pretty appropriate logo to have on my blog. I'm really thankful for the Kamikazen for having done it for me. It is a great piece of artwork.
