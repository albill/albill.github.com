I was going to write about the wonderful day that I had at the Great America amusement park with R and her niece today since we are visiting the Bay Area.

I just read, here on LJ, about Tim&apos;s death. I am shocked and tearful at the moment. I don&apos;t know what to say beyond what I just posted in his journal but I&apos;d appreciate it if someone could e-mail me with whatever public information there is. I&apos;m just fucking stunned at the moment.
