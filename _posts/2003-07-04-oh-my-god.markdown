I was going to write about the wonderful day that I had at the Great
America amusement park with R and her niece today since we are visiting
the Bay Area. I just read, here on LJ, about Tim's death. I am shocked
and tearful at the moment. I don't know what to say beyond what I just
posted in his journal but I'd appreciate it if someone could e-mail me
with whatever public information there is. I'm just fucking stunned at
the moment.
