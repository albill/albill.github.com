<p><a href="http://www.acemonstertoys.org">Ace Monster Toys</a>, the hackerspace which I helped found in Oakland, will have a <a href="http://makerfaire.com/pub/e/5124">presence</a> at <a href="http://makerfaire.com/">Maker Faire</a> this coming weekend. This is a first for us as we went through our founding process just around the same time Maker Faire happened last year, elected our board last June, and got our space at the end of July. We did attend the East Bay Mini Maker Faire but this is our first really large scale event.
<p>We'll be in the Fiesta Hall (oooh, sounds fun!) in the hackerspace area. <a href="http://blog.bl00cyb.org/">Willow</a> over at <a href="http://www.jigsawrenaissance.org/">Jigsaw Renaissance</a> arranged for a bunch of hackerspaces to share a common large room for our booths, which is cool. Right now, we expect to have a working copy of the DIY Book Scanner that we've been working on for the past few months and beta kits of it to be sold to a few people. Myles has been working on a laser cuttable version of the platen and other key pieces. We'll be selling these along with some bags of parts to help people build their own. This is our first attempt to do so.

<p>I expect that we'll also have the makerbots and a few other things there. AMT members will be staffing the booth during the open hours of the faire and I plan to be there from opening until 2:00 PM or so on both days.
