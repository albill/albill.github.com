The Two Towers of Microsoft and Palm...I bought a Palm Tungsten C via
Ebay last night (and got it for about half of the list price, which
seems fair) so I'm going to finally have a device made by someone other
than my employer (or indirectly my employer). When it comes down to it,
I got it because it has built-in WiFi, a built-in keyboard, and decent
software available. I've also heard that it should be upgradeable to
next rev of the Palm OS which is supposed to be a big shift. I'll
probably get a real keyboard to use with it when I want to do some real
typing though. R and I watched the first DVD (of two) of the extended
**Two Towers** movie last night. We may watch the second half tonight.
So far, I'm enjoying the scenes that have been added or extended in it.
It helps the movie quite a bit in my opinion. R and I are also starting
to make plans to go to [PantheaCon](http://www.pantheacon.com) this
coming February. I went in 2001 and had an excellent time and people
have continued to recommend that we go to it. We're just figuring out
the finances end of it now.
