The two of them always make me laugh and it reminds me of how much I miss hanging out with her sometimes. These days it is only a few times a year for no really good reason. Once upon a time, it was almost every week but that's been a few years. They had Olivia, the baby, with them and she's gotten quite a bit bigger. It's always amazing how fast the babies grow. I find it amusing that as little as I liked children when I was younger, I'm actually quite fond of playing with them when visiting. I suppose fatherhood does some good.
