I've written a lot less as of late. I've felt that I've had less time to write overall and, in a sense, both less and more to write about. There is only so much that one can write about how good one's life is going right now. I&apos;m sure that it gets tiresome to read and I don&apos;t have a lot to add there. R and I are looking at moving into a house towards the latter part of the summer. That should be interesting, to say the least. In a 11 days, <a href="http://www.anunnaki.org/origins">Origins II</a> will be occuring. This is the big fundraiser and annual event for <a href="http://www.anunnaki.org">the Anunnaki Project</a> (who I webmaster for...). This should be a lot of fun and very interesting to local people. I encourage those interested to purchase tickets ahead of time. I should be staffing a table or some other step 'n fetchit kind of work there. The disorganizers ( being one) haven't really said yet. I&apos;m doing some interesting stuff this summer. It looks like one event or trip a month. In June, over the weekend of the Solstice, I had been planning on going to <strong>Black Star Gathering</strong>. I&apos;m friends with one of the organizers and I've volunteered to help out if needed. It looks like I may be involved in one of the ritual performances there. In early to mid-July, I'll be going to northern California for a couple of weeks with R for a planned outing. In late July, I'll be going to <a href="http://www.thedrive.net/publicdreams/illuminares.htm">Illuminares</a> to perform with the <a href="http://www.cabiri.org">Cabiri</a>. This is an annual event up in Vancouver, British Columbia and is supposed to be a lot of fun. There is a camping trip with the <a href="http://www.seattle-oto.org">local OTO</a> in August over to the Olympic Penninsula at a spot that R and I found last year during our camping trip out there. Somehow, I don't think that I'll be going to Burning Man this year. There is too much going on locally and the product that I work on at Microsoft will be shipping, effectively, about the same time as Burning Man will be happening so I'll probably be a bit wrapped up there. <em>Here is some more information on the Black Sun Gathering for those that are interested...</em> <strong>The Black Sun Gathering</strong> <strong>What is it?:</strong> The Black Sun gathering is a Dark Arts Festival. The intent is to bring together the weird, dark, dramatic and unusual elements of life and culture to a location of natural habitat. To bring forth a sense of communion with the elements and a general state of freedom to express our art and share it with those who will appreciate it. <strong>History:</strong> The Black Sun Gathering is put on by Dark Star productions and has gone under various titles for each of the Solstice and Equinox occurrences. In the past they have taken place in the northern parts of Washington. Our Prior gatherings were weekend campouts. Each night there was performance, music and ritual. Some of the prior acts includedâ€¦ *Witch-hunt (with Michael from Blood Axis, Annabel of Amber Asylum, B&apos;eirth of In Gowan Ring, and Marcus from the former group Crash Worship.) *Faith and Disease *Bloodbox (Michael Hensley of Yen Pox) *Anima Nocturna (ritual performance) *Lady Heather Djara (Bellydancing) *Fear of Dolls *pFrenz-C *DJ Fountainhead ***Homebrew wines and ales. and many other performers of various nature. <strong>Future:</strong> The gathering is taking place in Washington. As usual it will be a 3 day weekend campout. The theme and musical influence is of eclectic influence stemming from Gothic, Industrial, Tribal, Trance and Experimental sources. The production is and always has been a non profit gig. We are interested in incorporating a wide array of performance with the gathering. Contact by email if you would like to be a participant. The event will begin on the 21st of June, Friday (Summer Solstice) and end on the 23rd of June, Sunday. We hope to see you there.
