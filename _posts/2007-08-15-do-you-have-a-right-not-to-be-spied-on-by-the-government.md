Go read this blow by blow from the EFF case hearing today. The panel of judges here is working to determine whether the government can have this case thrown out by citing state secrets in response to all questions concerning this case.
<blockquote>"Litigating this action could result in exceptionally gave harm to national security in the United States," says Deputy Solicitor General Gregory Garr.</blockquote>
You may have heard about the discovery of the secret room in San Francisco where a copy of all AT&amp;T Internet traffic through the regional hub was (or is) being diverted. Documents were leaked.

The government doesn't want to admit that it was spying on all of us who are citizens on the Internet. They don't even want to answer the questions concerning the room's existence or what goes on there.
