I [blogged the other
day](http://www.openbuddha.com/2011/02/22/diy-book-scanner-in-progress/)
about the DIY Book Scanner that we've been working on at [Ace Monster
Toys](http://www.acemonstertoys.org), which we've gotten it roughly a
third finished. Daniel Reetz of
[diybookscanner.org](http://diybookscanner.org/), who invented it, saw
the post as he has an ongoing Google alert set for the site. It turns
out that he is in the Bay Area from Los Angeles this week for the
[Internet Archive for Personal Digital Archiving
conference](http://www.personalarchiving.com/), where he is speaking.
Dan arranged to come over to AMT to meet us last night during our weekly
meeting. He pointed out that while he sees pictures of a lot of book
scanner builds on his website, he very rarely gets to see them in the
flesh and meet people building them. Myles, whom I am helping with this
project, had some specific questions on the build so it turned out to be
fortuitous that he was available. Dan made it over after experiencing
some of the joys of San Francisco traffic (he actually got **out** of
the car he was in with a friend partway to the East Bay and got onto
BART in order to get to AMT in a timely manner). We showed him around
the space and showed him the book scanner progress. He then showed us
some LED lights that he's been working on for the book scanners to
improve the light and to use less power.

After some chatting, he agreed to do a dry run of his talk at the
conference today so we got to hear his take on the direction and
implications of digital photography and its ongoing development, which
was extremely cool.

*Daniel Reetz Lecturing*

He also showed us some of his other work in digital photography, part of
which got him his current job as an engineer instead of this kind of
thing just being a personal obsession. Of particular interest (and what
got people's attention) was his [Large Light Field Camera
Array](http://www.danreetz.com/blog/2009/12/04/futurepicture-the-large-light-field-camera-array-part-1/).
You can check out his [blog](http://www.danreetz.com/blog/) for many
more of his projects and interests. All in all, it was quite cool and
appreciated to have him come by and visit us at AMT. **Update:** Daniel
gave his official presentation of his talk at the personal archiving
conference the next day and the [video is
online](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMMogOoWEbI) now for those
interested in seeing it.
