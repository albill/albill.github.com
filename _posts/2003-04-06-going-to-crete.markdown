We&apos;re off to Port Athnios in about an hour to head down to our ferry to Crete. That&apos;s about a three hour trip from here.

We went out to a nice dinner last night and had a small bottle of the local red wine. Quite nice. The service is lousy but R says that this is not unusual in Europe.

We wandered around a bit afterwards but I was fairly tired from all of the hiking earlier so we went back to the hotel. 

This morning we went looking for crepes and were stalked through the streets by some mongrel. This dog literally followed us for over half an hour. Since it had been raining, you can imagine the joy of being followed through the twisty village streets by a wet, nappy dog while we looked for yummy food. I did find chocolate covered baklava though.

All this and we still have more than a week to go here in Greece. Yay!
