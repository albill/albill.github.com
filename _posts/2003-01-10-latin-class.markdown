Ah...Latin...Look, the alphabet...it's so...so...readable!! No struggling to remember funny foreign characters! (And yes, I did have five years of Russian but shut up about it...)

Latin was cool tonight. I may grow to hate it or something but I must say that my initial impressions say otherwise. Unlike , I like the sound of Latin much more than Greek's pollysyllabic bibble-babble. All that childhood Catholic conditioning must be catching up...

Time to do more ritual work in Latin.
