The computer comes apart into many small pieces in a few minutes. I have the work laptop with the nda-necessary-to-even-look-at-it build of Longhorn on it but I may or may not to have time to turn it on. I&apos;m leaving the wireless running here over the weekened because the phone and DSL are on through Monday and we&apos;ll be cleaning her.

New place has no phone. We don&apos;t even have a date for a date yet so I may be stuck with work and nothing. Once we have a phone, I can order DSL or I might go cable modem after seeing the prices those fuckers at Verizon offer. I&apos;m pretty particular about my net access as both a professional nethead and all around freak about it.

The house is almost entirely packed. I have to put the TIVO away now (<i>sob!!</i>) and pack a box or two with the last of the clothes. Then I have to lock the kitties up.
