My eyes hurt. Bleh.

I just spent a couple of hours updating the version of Magick Without Tears on Hermetic.com to the version that Nu Isis nicely formatted. Of course, since they are on Geocities and use really cheezy XML closing tags everywhere (and a funky style), this meant that I had to edit every one of 79 pages by hand (because Geocities cheese is unique on each page) and then edit the formatting. Argh!! See <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/mwt_contents.html">here</a> if you want.

I then added a new article by Sam Webster to his site and updated his bio at his request.

Time to go read some lovecraft or something.
