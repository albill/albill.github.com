I haven't been posting as much here or any of my other blogs as of late. This is the perenial generic blog complaint of "I know that I haven't been posting much..."

Well, it is true. I have reflected on this the last few years and compared it to the first few years I was blogging (well, up until late 2008, really), and I realize that most of the energy that I put into it *really* has been subsumed by things like twitter and other forms of online interaction. If you have only so many words in a week that you want to type *and* you work for a tech company where most of your interaction with people is through text in bugs, online chat, and so forth, it really is more trouble to write.

I have recently been inspired by my friend, Jonathan, and his [blog](http://miniver.blogspot.com/). Jonathan doesn't do a lot of long form posts, what I once considered the main justification for blogging, but he managing to post some of a medium form length at least a couple of times a week on average. That seems to be a good ballpark these days. That is kind of the tumblrification of blogging. Short, one page, posts that are too long for twitter or the like. Like Jonathan, I prefer to own my own content and host it in a place under my control (not tumblr), so I will continue to host it here (and on [makehacklearn](http://makehacklearn.org) or [Pagan Dharma](http://pagandharma.org)).

I serve this blog via [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and I'm using [prose.io](http://prose.io) now to try to do quick and simple writing. I'm going to try to commit myself to posting at least two things a week here, even if they are short bits. We'll see how I do. I still have a couple of book reviews to get up as well.
