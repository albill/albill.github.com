Following our visit with the Mythbusters and the Exploratorium, R and I took a stroll around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_Of_Fine_Arts">Palace of Fine Arts</a>. I'd never been there before though I had heard about it many times over the years.

I have a thing for architecture, especially in a Classical or pseudo-Classical style so I took a lot of photos. I've put them up in a set on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/">my flickr account</a>.

Here are a couple from the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157594176296890/">set</a>:
