R and I are back from Mexico now. We left Cancun this morning and flew
back to Oakland via Charlotte. That's a bit of a trip. On Saturday, we
stopped by Ek Balam, a recently opened ruins site, on our way from
Merida to Cancun. I'll be posting photos later. I did add photos of our
visit to Uxmal on Friday to
[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/) tonight. I've create a
few [photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157594362964051/)
[sets](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157594362993703/) as
well. Here is a sample:

Tomorrow morning, we both go back to work. The vacation is now over...
