R and I went to [Diesel
Books](http://diesel.booksense.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp) in Oakland
last night to hear [Brad Warner](http://hardcorezen.blogspot.com/)
speak. He's doing his tour to promote his new book, **[Zen Wrapped in
Karma Dipped in
Chocolate](http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Wrapped-Karma-Dipped-Chocolate/dp/1577316541)**.
Brad spoke for a bit over an hour about the circumstances that led to
him doing this book (and a bit on the others) and took some Q&A from the
audience. It was interesting to hear him speak in person. As others have
said, when you hear him in person, as opposed to just reading his
writing on his [blog](http://hardcorezen.blogspot.com/), he comes off as
a lot less of an asshole and with more of a sense of humor. I actually
enjoyed his talk and, while I own his books, I haven't been a huge fan
of some of his behavior online. He, of course, alluded to the whole
Genpo Roshi issue but managed to avoid actually mentioning him by name.
He had some amusing anecdotes about wandering into, one assumes, Green
Gulch of the San Francisco Zen Center, wearing his brown rakusu without
realizing that in their organization a brown rakusu has a specific
meaning related to the level of transmission or ordination of the person
wearing it. He said people kept staring at him and he wondered if he had
a booger hanging out of his nose or if something else was wrong. I
thought it was interesting that he mentioned writing three science
fiction novels before writing his Zen books. These, of course, were not
published but prepared him for how to submit a book to a publisher
expecting it to fail, which was what he expected with his first book,
**Hardcore Zen**. I did get to ask him if he could be the L. Ron Hubbard
of the Zen world, which elicited a comment that he lived in LA so you
had to be careful making Hubbard remarks where he lived for fear of
consequences (said with a laugh). All in all, an interesting and brief
talk. I've already picked up his latest book and I randomly read about a
chapter of it. It seems to be a much more personal book, dealing with
his divorce, job loss, and deaths in the family, that his previous two
but he's always mixed a lot of the personal into his books.
