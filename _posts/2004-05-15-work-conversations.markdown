We had a morale event at work yesterday where we all went and played
Whirleyball for an afternoon and drank a lot of beer.\
\
After a few beers, interesting conversations can happen (unlike
non-alcohol fueled work events with only a few exceptions). Believe it
or not, I'm rather introverted so I often don't have a lot to say to
people that I don't know reasonably well about my true thoughts. Being
part of the management chain makes this doubly true since every thought
that crosses my brain isn't necessarily the best thing to share with my
peers or the people that report to us. One must keep up appearances of
normality and such for the sake of the Empire. Lay back and think of
England and all that.\
\
It was kind of amusing when we were sitting around and the topic of
parents came up...There is very little in the realm of "appropriate
workplace conversation" that can be said about my parents. I'd say that
normality skipped a generation except:

-   I'm not necessarily strongly within the mainstream myself a lot of
    the time
-   my dad isn't exactly not normal as much as weird in a fairly normal
    sort of way. Lots of people have slightly eccentric parents.

My mother is not non-normal by my standards but then I'm engaged to be
married to a woman that used to dress up as a nun with sequins and go do
events with a bunch of gay men for AIDS awareness and my idea of the
nature of the world left the realm of consensus reality when I was a
teenager. Who am I say to say what is normal anymore? I'm not even sure
what it supposed to mean though I get visions of slack-clad Republican
armies who have missionary sex on weekends and dinner at 6:00 on
weekdays.\
\
Besides, I think people are actually a lot weirder than they often let
on. I could be wrong and I have met a few amazingly normal people at
work so it is hard to tell. I recall the time someone made a BDSM
reference in passing (not me!) and an unnamed coworker just got a
confused look on his face. Since it was at a drinking event and he
actually asked (more than once), I took the time to try to explain what
BDSM meant. Oooh, boy. That was an odd conversation.
