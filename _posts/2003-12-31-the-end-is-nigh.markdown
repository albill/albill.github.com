According to a NY Post article, referenced in a CBC.ca article, William Shatner will soon release a new album -- produced by Ben Folds of Ben Folds Five fame, and including guest artists such as former Black Flag frontman Henry Rollins and country artist Brad Paisley.
<blockquote>The new album isn't the first foray into recording for the Montreal-born actor best known for playing James T. Kirk, the captain of the starship Enterprise on the original Star Trek series. In 1968, Shatner released his first album The Transformed Man, which includes spoken-word cover versions of the Beatles' Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds and Bob Dylan's Mr. Tambourine Man. Although Shatner intended The Transformed Man to be taken seriously, it's become something of a camp classic. The Hip Surgery Music Guide, an internet guide that celebrates offbeat musical genres, says the songs can be taken as examples of "either impassioned intensity or pompous overacting."</blockquote>
