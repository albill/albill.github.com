According to a NY Post article, referenced in a CBC.ca article, William
Shatner will soon release a new album -- produced by Ben Folds of Ben
Folds Five fame, and including guest artists such as former Black Flag
frontman Henry Rollins and country artist Brad Paisley.

> The new album isn't the first foray into recording for the
> Montreal-born actor best known for playing James T. Kirk, the captain
> of the starship Enterprise on the original Star Trek series. In 1968,
> Shatner released his first album The Transformed Man, which includes
> spoken-word cover versions of the Beatles' Lucy in the Sky With
> Diamonds and Bob Dylan's Mr. Tambourine Man. Although Shatner intended
> The Transformed Man to be taken seriously, it's become something of a
> camp classic. The Hip Surgery Music Guide, an internet guide that
> celebrates offbeat musical genres, says the songs can be taken as
> examples of "either impassioned intensity or pompous overacting."
