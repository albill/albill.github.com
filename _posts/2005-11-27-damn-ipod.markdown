My Ipod's battery seems to be toast. It warns me of "low battery" all
the time and shuts itself off, even an hour after charging it.\
\
I thought the system had just gotten out of synch so I fully charged it
from the wall and then wiped the firmware back to factory defaults. I
loaded my podcasts and things seemed fine. I then copied all of my
music, walked away from the machine with it playing and had it saying
"low battery" a minute later. It looks like I need to self-service it by
getting a new battery since Apple certainly doesn't do that for you.
