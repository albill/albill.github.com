Today was "write your review" day at work. Microsoft has an annual curve-based and "measured against your peers" review process that involves the creation (from a six page word template) of a 14 page review or so (for me). Today was the day where we I got to justify my existance at work. I actually broke down and had two krispy kreme donuts as comfort food.

We had no meetings scheduled today because of this and a BBQ to celebrate finishing with beer at 3:00. At 1:30, I got a phone call from the escrow company, "Can you and R come sign papers for closing at 4:00?" "Ok!!" so I bailed early, got a cashier&apos;s check for the balance of our down payment at the bank and we drove across to our side of the county to sign.

Once we were done with that, we had to rush straight to Capitol Hill for Jason Newcomb&apos;s lecture/workshop on the Abramelin Working. With parking and drive through food on the way, we actually wound up showing five minutes late to stares from all. ;-)

The lecture went well and we had an interesting time. Afterwards, Jason, R, Gasbari, Babalononyieh, Regulus666 and a couple of others went up to the Barca, a local wine bar/gin joint and tossed back a few and bullshitted a bit. Good conversation was had by all and R and I just got home. Jason will roll in with the dawn probably. heh.

Tomorrow is a "free" day. My daughter is out of town for the weekend and we move next Friday since the house has closed so we have a week to finish packing and I&apos;m going to take that day off. I&apos;ll probably go with Jason to his book signing tomorrow and Sunday there is the Gnostic Mass and a quarterly OTO meeting.
