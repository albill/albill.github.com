So I'm kind of fucked in the Prison Ministry department right now. With Monk out of town for the better part of a couple of months, I can't really get easy access to the inmates until I undergo volunteer training in January. I can't attend anything at the prison unassisted until I'm officially a volunteer and trained. 

Working with a group of Wiccan prisoners brings me back to my own roots in the Wiccan community. Since my Gardnerian (<em>Protean</em>) initiation is irregular (male to male) and only for first degree, I'm thinking that I should actually bite the bullet and get around to getting an initiation into an official line. I think it would help my work on both the external, internal and subtle levels. I need to find someone in the community locally that I already know or who is an associate of one of my longstanding friends in order to do this most easily. Otherwise, I'm going to have to go through the entire "year and a day" / getting to know you thing in order to just get First, let alone Second.

Given that I've been involved in paganism for 14 years now and have been around the block once or twice, sitting in someone's uberbasic outer grover would probably drive me to doing a sacrifice to the gods of the bodily sort.
