This is an interesting (and depressing) read though it mirrors things that I've seen. <a href="http://fullcirclenews.blogspot.com/2005/02/tis-mystery.html">http://fullcirclenews.blogspot.com/2005/02/tis-mystery.html</a> I have also noticed people that were the experienced elders when I first got involved 15 years ago disappearing over time. I used to wonder where all of the 65 year old magicians were, for example. Now, I think the answer is "hiding from you."
