![image](http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Game/Dragons/drakkross.GIF) This
has been around a little while. The author is a nice guy that I've
spoken to on the net off and on for years. It looks to have some
possibilities as a setting for a fun game though I'm still pretty hip to
Transhuman Space. Is there a game setting that hasn't been overdone yet?
I'm kind of burned out on most fantasy...
