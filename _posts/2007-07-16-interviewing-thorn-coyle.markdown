[Thorn](http://www.thorncoyle.com/) and I met yesterday for her
interview for the [Ex Templo](http://www.extemplo.org) podcast at her
place in San Francisco. We spoke for about an hour or so for the
recorded podcast and I think it went pretty well. I'm editing the audio
files and I will try to get the first portion online before the end of
the week. I'm going to [Wordcamp](http://2007.wordcamp.org/) all next
weekend so I actually do have an imperative to get this done before
then. One of the things I'll be doing there is attending the
[Podcasting](http://2007.wordcamp.org/schedule/podcasting/) session with
the maker of [Podpress](http://www.mightyseek.com/podpress/), which I
use for podcasting. I'm looking forward to this little two day
conference.
