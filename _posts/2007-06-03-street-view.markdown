Unlike some, I'm not terribly concerned about Google's new "street view" feature for Google Maps. Of course, they didn't even drive their van in front of my house.

I do find it kind of cool that you can look around large streets, even in the East Bay, and get a sense of things.

If you go to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=1853+Solano+Ave.,+Berkeley,+Ca&amp;sll=37.874379,-122.261095&amp;sspn=0.046477,0.063944&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;om=0&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=37.849769,-122.285863&amp;cbp=1,433.947125703376,0.51456807219488,0&amp;ll=37.853085,-122.283862&amp;spn=0.011402,0.023346&amp;z=16">this link</a>, you can see the view on San Pablo near my house. San Pablo is a north-south street that runs from Oakland through Emeryville and Berkeley and then continues up north quite a ways. It is the main way in and out of our part of Oakland/Emeryville.
