I'm in Minneapolis using my friend, Elliott's, computer. I'm staying
with him and his wife this evening. A long day... up at 6:30 AM, anal
probe at the airport, flight to Minneapolis and general galavanting
around town. We had a nice dinner at an Asian fusion restaurant and I
got what I think was a five-shot Americano (no, I'm not joking...it was
a quad by default from the sign and the barrista gave me an extra
shot...) after dinner because I was dragging. Of course, the time here
is two hours later so it's really before 11:00 PM for me. Tomorrow is a
day of relaxation and hanging out before more serious work in the
afternoon. I'll be back in Seattle on Sunday afternoon.
