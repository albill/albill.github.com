R and I went out to Saul's in Berkeley today for lunch. (For those that are in the area, Saul's is a wonderful New York deli and restaurant which serves some of the best deli food in the area.)

Following food, I made a side trip into Black Oak Books, a few doors down, and made the mistake of going into the Buddhist portion of the used section in the back. I wond up walking out about 30 minutes later with a few hardcover books:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yogacara-Idealism-1987-K-Chatterjee/dp/8120803159/">The Yogacara Idealism</a> by Ashok Kumar Chatterjee</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Entry-into-Inconceivable-Introduction-Buddhism/dp/0824816978/">Entry into the Inconceivable: An Introduction to Hua-Yen Buddhism</a> by Thomas Cleary</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Buddhist-Teaching-Totality-Philosophy-Buddhism/dp/0271011793/">The Buddhist Teachings of Totality: The Philosophy of Hwa Yen Buddhism</a> by Garma C.C. Chang</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Five-Mountains-Monastic-Institution-Monographs/dp/0674304985">Five Mountains: The Rinzai Zen Monastic Institution in Medieval Japan</a> by Martin Collcutt</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Flesh-Bones-Collection-Writings/dp/0804831866">Zen Flesh, Zen Bones</a> by Paul Reps</li>
</ul>
Since I've been getting rid of a lot of books lately, it goes against my grain to buy many more but all of these seemed too good to past up when I saw them. We'll see what I get the time to work through all of them.
