R and I went out to Saul's in Berkeley today for lunch. (For those that
are in the area, Saul's is a wonderful New York deli and restaurant
which serves some of the best deli food in the area.) Following food, I
made a side trip into Black Oak Books, a few doors down, and made the
mistake of going into the Buddhist portion of the used section in the
back. I wond up walking out about 30 minutes later with a few hardcover
books:

Since I've been getting rid of a lot of books lately, it goes against my
grain to buy many more but all of these seemed too good to past up when
I saw them. We'll see what I get the time to work through all of them.
