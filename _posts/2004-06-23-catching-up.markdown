<p>I haven't written much lately. It isn't for lack of desire but I have found myself, as I am now, on the wrong side of midnight and with things to say or at least daily life to relate in lieu of things to really say.</p><p>I worked through a bit of fiction this weekend. I finished off Michael Swanwick's <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380812894/">Bones of the Earth</a></b>, which was a typically high caliber novel from him. I always enjoy his work though I think he is really a master of short fiction moreso than novels. I then read <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0451459393/">The Way of the Wolf</a></b>, which was a fairly light &quot;action-adventure&quot; type of read. I wasn't expecting much but I found it to be a reasonably well-crafted &quot;vampires in a post-apocalyptic Earth&quot; book. I'll probably read the sequel but I expect that I will get it from the library.</p><p>On the non-fiction front, I'm still working through Chogyam Trungpa's <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1570628181/">Great Eastern Sun</a></b>, which is his second &quot;Shambhala&quot; book. I like a lot of what he has to say and find him pretty insightful but I can't pay the attention that I want to if I'm tired or otherwise not able to focus well late in the evening so I've only been reading it when home earlier on, which hasn't been much lately. I have a number of Buddhist texts to work through, as well as some books by Namkhai Norbu that I hadn't read yet in the &quot;serious books&quot; department. I still need to finish <b>Guns, Germs, and Steel</b> as well.</p><p>

Next weekend is the normal weekend that I'm supposed to do my work with Wiccan prisoners at McNeil Island but I'm going to be in Portland this next weekend for Trekchod teachings from a Bonpo teacher. I moved the session with the guys to this last weekend but it would up being in the evening instead of early morning. I haven't decided which is more tiring, getting up at 5:30 AM in order to arrive at the prison by 8:00 AM for an 8:30 meeting and getting home around 1:00 or 2:00 PM or leaving home at 3:00 PM in order to make the 5:00 PM ferry to the prison for a 6:00 PM meeting and getting home at 11:00 PM. Probably the former but the latter effectively made Saturday the &quot;eight hours of prison a-go-go&quot; day. I feel that the session with the guys went well and I've got some more direction on what we should be doing over the rest of the year. </p><p>Sunday, being Father's Day, had Madeline over to spend time with me. She brought me a nice card and a gift. She made me another gift but left it at school. The one she bought is to the right. R thinks my ex-wife did this to me and must still hate me a little. heh. Personally, I think Madeline picked it herself, which says something about the nut not falling far from the tree...</p><p>She and I went out to lunch and washed my car. Apparently, in the world of my child, getting to help me wash my car falls into the &quot;really neat things to do with papa&quot; camp. Too bad I don't have a fence that I need to whitewash.</p><p>Monday started what has turned out to be a hellishly busy work week so far (and it seems like it is going to continue down that line since I have a four 
hour meeting tomorrow). R and I went over to our Wiccan High Priestess' place after work for our Summer Solstice rite. This wound up turning largely into a &quot;dinner and gab&quot; session but I had a nice time chatting with everyone.</p><p>This evening, after working a bit late at work, I had dinner with my friend, John from work and then went over to Half Price Books. I picked up copies of:</p><ul>
	<li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0877735921/">The Heart of the Buddha</a></b> by Chogyam Trungpa</li><li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1570625018/">The Collected Works of Ken Wilber, Vol. 1: Spectrum of Consciousness: No Boundary: Selected Essays</a></b></li><li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1570625026/">The Collected Works of Ken Wilber, Vol. 2: Up From Eden: The Atman Project</a></b></li><li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0472108077/">What Has Athens to Do With Jerusalem: <i>Timaeus</i> and <i>Genesis</i> in Counterpoint</a></b></li></ul><p>The last looks to be especially interesting in that it looks at how interpretations of Plato's <i>Timaeus</i> have been influenced by Christianity's own interpretation of <i>Genesis</i>. <i>Timaeus</i> was one of the few platonic texts in circulation in the Middle Ages and had quite an impact over time.</p>
