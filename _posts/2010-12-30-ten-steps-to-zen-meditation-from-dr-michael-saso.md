I'm going to "steal" from another blog here, which I generally avoid doing, in order to draw attention to it and what it has to say. Dr. Michael Saso has posted a synopsis version of the ten steps in shamatha and vipassana practice according to Zhi Yi, the famous ancestor (what my lineage of practice calls the "patriarchs") of Tendai Buddhism.

I found this an excellent enough summary that I wanted to repeat it here and draw attention to Dr. Saso's quite enjoyable and informative, if occasional, blog posts.

<a href="http://www.michaelsaso.org/?p=1552"><strong>Ten Steps to “Zen” (Samatha Vipassyana) meditation</strong></a>

(Adapted from Zhi Yi’s writings, on Mt. Tiantai, 560-580)

<ol><li>never harm, or say bad things about anyone;</li>
<li>Purify the five sense (ears, eyes, nose, taste, touch) of “me only” feelings;</li>
<li>Purify the heart of “me only” desires, and the mind of all images;</li>
<li>Harmonize breathing, eating, sleeping, and daily living by “centering;”
(i.e., be focused on "Transcendent” presence within)</li>
<li>The joy of “Stop-samatha” “Look-vipassyana” prayer is overwhelming:</li>
<li>stop all judging; to look at others with compassion;</li>
<li>A true spiritual path overflows with love & compassion;</li>
<li>Discern “good,” and “bad” spirits, to heal them;</li>
<li>True love/compassion really does heal others;</li>
<li>Follow any and all spiritual paths that teach compassion.</li></ol>

I wanted to add that <a href="http://www.kalavinka.org/">Kalavinka Press</a> has wonderful translations available of Zhi Yi's (Chih-i) writings in both printed and PDF formats. They have his <a href="http://www.kalavinka.org/kp_book_pages/ebm_book_page.htm">The Essentials of Buddhist Meditation</a> and <a href="http://www.kalavinka.org/kp_book_pages/sgs_book_page.htm">The Six Dharma Gates to the Sublime</a> available. Both are excellent meditation manuals and well recommended to me by my local Tendai priest (and occasional teacher), Rev. Keisho of the <a href="http://caltendai.org/">California Tendai Buddhist Monastery</a> when he was teaching meditation locally. Zhi Yi's works have been used by many in both China and Japan over the centuries as guides to practice.
