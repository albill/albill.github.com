This is from [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net): Two exciting and
thought-provoking Bruce Sterling interviews are online today: an
hour-long MP3 of an interview with Massive Change on the University of
Toronto's CIUT radio and a long interview on the future of everything
with Mike "Godwin's Law" Godwin in the libertarian mag, "Reason."

> reason: Blogging seems to have taken a place in the culture that used
> to be occupied by fanzines, and maybe by the science fiction
> magazines. Sterling: It had its apotheosis in people like Cory
> Doctorow [author of Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom] and other
> writers who really aren?t that interested in the old paper world. Cory
> actually publishes stuff electronically, and blogging is his Weird
> Tales. He is of a generation sufficiently divorced from the old pulps
> that he?s the dolphin among mesosaurs here.
