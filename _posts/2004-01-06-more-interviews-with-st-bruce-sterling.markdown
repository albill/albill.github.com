This is from <a href="http://www.boingboing.net">Boing Boing</a>:

Two exciting and thought-provoking Bruce Sterling interviews are online today: an hour-long MP3 of an interview with <a title="http://massivechange.com/staticpages/index.php?page=radio">Massive Change</a> on the University of Toronto's CIUT radio and a long interview on the future of everything with Mike "Godwin's Law" Godwin in the libertarian mag, "Reason."
<blockquote>reason: Blogging seems to have taken a place in the culture that used to be 	occupied by fanzines, and maybe by the science fiction magazines.

Sterling: It had its apotheosis in people like Cory Doctorow [author of Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom] and other writers who really aren?t that interested in the old paper world. Cory actually publishes stuff 	electronically, and blogging is his Weird Tales. He is of a generation sufficiently divorced from the old pulps that he?s the dolphin among mesosaurs here.</blockquote>
