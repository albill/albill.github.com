had been under the impression that the techbeta for IE8 was going to be
closed. Apparently, this was wrong information on my part. With the
[Mix08](http://visitmix.com/2008/default.aspx) conference occurring
today, the first beta of IE8 is now available. You can find a list of
features on the [Microsoft
site](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ie8/readiness/NewFeatures.htm).
You can get the Vista version
[here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=110325) and the XP version
[here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=110324), if you are so
inclined. I plan on taking a look at it in some detail and comparing it
to the feature set that I know from IE8. With the release of this today,
there are also videos discussing IE8 or demoing it from various members
of the IE team. They are in Windows formats but
[Videolan](http://www.videolan.org/) can play them if you aren't on a
Windows machine.

Below are some screenshots from XP that I quickly took. Please click on
them for the full sized image for the full browser shots. I did note
that if you select the "Emulate IE7" button, you need to completely
restart the browser.

**Update:** I've added the [CSS3 Selector
Test](http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/css3tests/selectorTest.html#target)
as well:
