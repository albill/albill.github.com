At Mozilla yesterday evening, we took some time off from shipping a major browser update to play kickball. It was labeled "Intern vs. Old Guy" kickball but one wit. As probably the second oldest person in the group, you can guess which team I was on.

At one point in the game, we managed to get the ball stuck in the trees dotting the parking lot. This was soon joined by its friend, the helpful shoe. Eventually, first base was able to convince both to come back. A picture was taken of our attempts to retrieve the ball:

My coworker <a href="http://www.numenity.org/blog/">Paul Kim</a> put a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fmg2001/tags/kickball/">few photos</a> up on his Flickr account as well. He also <a href="http://www.numenity.org/blog/2007/06/29/iphone-free-for-all/">blogged</a> about it.

Oh, and Old Guys won 26 to 22!
