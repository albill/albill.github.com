R and I took the train out to Mt. Hiei (Hieisan) today. This is the home
of Tendai Buddhism, from whom the temple I am associated with in Ohio
derives its lineage. The temple complex is about an hour outside of
Kyoto on top of a mountain. We took a JR line train out there and then
took the cablecar up the mountain.

From there, we explored the East and West complexes. The east complex,
Todo, contains Enryaku-ji, which has a number of famous buildings in it,
such as Konpon-Chudo:

We spent a couple of hours wandering around there.

The west complex is Saito and is connected to Todo by a 1.2 kilometer
trail connecting them. When they say "1.2 kilometers" to you, they don't
mean a nice easy grade with a paved way and handrails. This trail goes
up and down and around. It includes what I can only call the "Stairs of
Doom", which look quite nice, until you are seeing them from the bottom
on your way back after hiking on a mountain for five hours.

I have a
[photoset](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157602170898916/)
with, oh, 145 photos in it up on Flickr now for you to see if you are so
inclined. These are being added to the overall [Japan
collection](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/collections/72157602133089652/),
which will include all of the smaller sets that I do. Tomorrow, we plan
on seeing the Kyoto Imperial Palace and maybe some of the larger temples
and shrines in town.
