A quote from B. Alan Wallace for the evening.

> Every single sentient being wishes to be happy and free of suffering.
> By no means does Buddhism say this is wrong; rather, this is where we
> start from. The very root of this yearning for happiness, this
> yearning to be free of suffering, is the fundamental expression of the
> buddha-nature. If for the time being we turn our gaze away from the
> myriad ways that we can stray from the agenda -- trying to find
> happiness by buying a more luxurious car, or a bigger house, or
> getting a better job -- and just come back to the primary desire of
> wishing to be happy, we find at the very source of our yearning for
> happiness the buddha-nature wanting to realize itself. It's like a
> seed that wants to spring into the sunlight. Sometimes it gets
> terribly contorted, when we want to injure somebody else for the sake
> of our own happiness, but the fundamental yearning is something to be
> embraced.
