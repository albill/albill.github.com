<strong>Guhyagarbha Tantra Empowerment:</strong>
<em><strong>The Secret Essence called
The Magical Matrix of the Peaceful and Wrathful Deities</strong></em>
Tulku Jigme Tendzin Chödrak, Kilung RinpocheFebruary 21 - 23, 2002
Sakya Monastery, Seattle

The Guhyagarbha, one of the oldest known tantras, is the primary and most important teaching of the Mahayoga class of the Nine-Yana system.  Taught by Shakyamuni Buddha and transmitted in an unbroken line to the present, it is a root source for the Nyingma tradition. It is also the primary literary source for the mandala of the Hundred Peaceful and Wrathful Deities. Many important commentaries have been written about it, including by Padmasambhava, Vimalamitra, and Longchenpa. By receiving this initiation we make a direct connection with the blessings of the Buddha, with the Vajrayana, and are introduced to the Peaceful and Wrathful Deities.

Time: Friday, February 21, at 7:30 pm.
Saturday and Sunday, February 22 and 23, beginning at 1 pm and late into the evening. The exact times are subject to change and the empowerment may run later than anticipated each day. Please arrive 20 minutes early. Plan to attend full empowerment.
Prerequisite: Experience in Ngöndro or Dzogchen practice.

<em>This empowerment is being offered at the request of Tsultrim Allione and Tara Mandala.</em>
