Written by Malaclypse the Younger<br>
Adapted &amp; directed by Scott O. Moore<br>
Dedicated to the Prettiest One<br>
<br>
GOD IS A GIRL AND HER NAME IS ERIS<br>
<br>
Adapted for the stage by director Scott O. Moore, PRINCIPIA DISCORDIA -<br>
LIVE! is a madcap object lesson in Discordianism, the most relevant<br>
religion ever conceived. Principia Discordia is the official bible of the<br>
religion disguised as a joke (or a joke disguised as a religion) based on<br>
the worship of Eris, ancient Greek goddess of confusion - also known to<br>
the ancient Romans as Discordia. A legendary underground classic, it<br>
contains &quot;Absolutely Everything Worth Knowing About Absolutely Anything.&quot;<br>
<br>
In PRINCIPIA DISCORDIA - LIVE!, you will learn about the goddess Eris, the<br>
Law of Fives, the Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria, the Curse of<br>
Greyface, Mr. Momomoto (who can swallow his nose), and much much more! By<br>
opening your pineal gland to the Mysterees of Eris, you too can know the<br>
true meaning of the Myth of the Apple of Discord, and can learn the Golden<br>
Secret that will save humanity from itself!<br>
<br>
The ensemble cast includes (in alphabetical disorder) Betsy Morris, Chris<br>
Haddad, Mike Pham, Jen Downs, and Paul Gude. Zach Zulauf is the assistant<br>
director.<br>
<br>
PRINCIPIA DISCORDIA - LIVE! is part of the Annex Late-Night series,<br>
curated by Annex Theatre's outgoing Artistic Director, Bret Fetzer. The<br>
incoming Artistic Director is Gillian Jorgensen. Annex Theatre is<br>
dedicated to creating bold new work in an environment of improbability,<br>
resourcefulness and risk.&nbsp;</p>
