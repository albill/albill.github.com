 Adapted for the stage by director Scott O. Moore, PRINCIPIA DISCORDIA
-\
 LIVE! is a madcap object lesson in Discordianism, the most relevant\
 religion ever conceived. Principia Discordia is the official bible of
the\
 religion disguised as a joke (or a joke disguised as a religion) based
on\
 the worship of Eris, ancient Greek goddess of confusion - also known
to\
 the ancient Romans as Discordia. A legendary underground classic, it\
 contains "Absolutely Everything Worth Knowing About Absolutely
Anything."\
 \
 In PRINCIPIA DISCORDIA - LIVE!, you will learn about the goddess Eris,
the\
 Law of Fives, the Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria, the Curse of\
 Greyface, Mr. Momomoto (who can swallow his nose), and much much more!
By\
 opening your pineal gland to the Mysterees of Eris, you too can know
the\
 true meaning of the Myth of the Apple of Discord, and can learn the
Golden\
 Secret that will save humanity from itself!\
 \
 The ensemble cast includes (in alphabetical disorder) Betsy Morris,
Chris\
 Haddad, Mike Pham, Jen Downs, and Paul Gude. Zach Zulauf is the
assistant\
 director.\
 \
 PRINCIPIA DISCORDIA - LIVE! is part of the Annex Late-Night series,\
 curated by Annex Theatre's outgoing Artistic Director, Bret Fetzer.
The\
 incoming Artistic Director is Gillian Jorgensen. Annex Theatre is\
 dedicated to creating bold new work in an environment of
improbability,\
 resourcefulness and risk.
