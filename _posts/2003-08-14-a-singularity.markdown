From William Blake via Ken MacLeod:

> 1. Then the Inhabitants of those Cities: Felt their Nerves change into
> Marrow And hardening Bones began In swift diseases and torments, In
> throbbings & shootings & grindings Thro' all the coasts; till weaken'd
> The Senses inward rush'd shrinking, Beneath the dark net of
> infection..... 7. The remaining sons of Urizen Beheld their brethren
> shrink together Beneath the Net of Urizen; Perswasion was in vain; For
> the ears of the inhabitants, Were wither'd, & deafen'd, & cold: And
> their eyes could not discern, Their brethren of other cities. 8. So
> Fuzon call'd all together The remaining children of Urizen: And they
> left the pendulous earth: They called it Egypt, & left it. 9. And the
> salt ocean rolled englob'd.

-- William Blake, **The Book of Urizen**, Chapter IX.
