From William Blake via Ken MacLeod: 
                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      <blockquote>
                                                                                                                                                        1. Then the Inhabitants of those Cities: Felt their Nerves change into Marrow And hardening Bones began In swift diseases and torments, In throbbings & shootings & grindings Thro' all the coasts; till weaken'd The Senses inward rush'd shrinking, Beneath the dark net of infection..... 7. The remaining sons of Urizen Beheld their brethren shrink together Beneath the Net of Urizen; Perswasion was in vain; For the ears of the inhabitants, Were wither'd, & deafen'd, & cold: And their eyes could not discern, Their brethren of other cities. 8. So Fuzon call'd all together The remaining children of Urizen: And they left the pendulous earth: They called it Egypt, & left it. 9. And the salt ocean rolled englob'd.
