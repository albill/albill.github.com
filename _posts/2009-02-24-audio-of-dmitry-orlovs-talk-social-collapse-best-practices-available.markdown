The [Long Now Foundation](http://www.longnow.org) maintains a
[podcast](http://www.longnow.org/projects/seminars/podcast.php) of audio
from their seminars. I [blogged
recently](http://www.arcanology.com/2009/02/15/dmitry-orlov-on-the-best-practices-for-societal-collapse/)
about the talk that [Dmitry Orlov](http://cluborlov.blogspot.com) did,
"[Social Collapse Best
Practices](http://cluborlov.blogspot.com/2009/02/social-collapse-best-practices.html)."
I noticed in iTunes this morning that the talk is now available through
the Long Now's podcast. You can also get it directly
[here](http://fora.tv/media/rss/Long_Now_Podcasts/podcast-2009-02-13-orlov.mp3)
if you're so inclined. Additionally, Dmitry gave a talk the day before
at Point Reyes Bookstore. The
[audio](http://web.mac.com/bgong/Site/Home_Page/Entries/2009/2/23_Dmitry_Orlov_speaking_at_Point_Reyes_Books.html)
of this talk is available as well. Dmitry says it covers largely the
same ground as his Long Now talk except it was done unscripted. (I
haven't listened to it yet...).
