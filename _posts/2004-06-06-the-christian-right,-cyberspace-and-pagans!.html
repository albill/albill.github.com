Many neopagans, occultists, and New Agers deem the technologies of cyberspace as fitting media for their magical experiments and rituals and view the Internet as a mystical plane of being. For some in this movement, which has roots in the counterculture of the sixties, both hallucinogenic drugs and computers help to demonstrate that reality is strictly a matter of our own perception and therefore can be manipulated and even created. However, this enthusiasm for the mystical potential of human technology is misplaced, illogical, and spiritually dangerous. It vainly attempts to build a spiritual reality on the faulty foundation of silicon, instead of on Jesus Christ.

The backbone of cyberspace is the Internet, an international computer system linking individual computers through phone lines.

A new movement is forming that views cyberspace as a sacred realm for the expansion of consciousness. Working from neopagan, occult, and New Age assumptions, technoshamans claim they are the wired wizards of the digital world (shamanism and technoshamanism will be defined in detail later). As this strange phenomenon unfolds, Christians need to address it theologically and biblically if we are to reach today's technological culture effectively with the message of Jesus Christ. <lj-cut text="Read the whole deal..."><br /> <br />

On the Internet, the Timothy Leary home page explains: "Just after midnight, in his favorite bed among loving friends, Timothy Leary peacefully passed on. His lasts words were ‘why not?' and ‘yeah.'" Leary, who had been terminally ill for several months, had considered committing suicide via a live feed through the Worldwide Web. Instead, Leary kept visitors at his site informed on his declining condition and philosophized freely about it, claiming he had no fear of death. In 1995 he had announced he was "thrilled" to learn he had terminal prostate cancer and remarked, "How you die is the most important thing you ever do. It's the exit."<sup>1</sup> As Leary himself put it, he died a "designer death," displayed in cyberspace for all to access.

His fame spread to both hippies and hackers, and the overlap between the two. Leary is featured prominently in Douglas Rushkoff's offbeat manifesto, <i>Cyberia: Life in the Trenches of Hyperspace.</i><sup>3</sup> Rushkoff tells us that cyberians (the younger denizens of cyberspace) who use "drugs do not need to learn that reality is arbitrary and manipulable, or that the landscape of consciousness is broader than normal waking-state awareness suggests" because they have already learned these things from Leary and the psychedelic author Ken Kesey.<sup>4</sup> Rushkoff, a 20-something guru for Generation X, eulogized Leary on Leary's home page, saying, "Tim's whole trip — from psychedelics to computers to designer dying — was to communicate the fact that people are capable of taking charge of their own brains, hearts, and spirits."<sup>5</sup>

He believed virtual reality experiences and on-line communications could serve the same purposes as hallucinogenic drugs. Leary modified his famous credo of the 1960s, "Tune in, turn on, and drop out," to "Turn on, boot up, and jack in," and proclaimed that "PC [personal computing] is the LSD of the 1990s."<sup>6</sup> It was not an either/or for Leary; in a 1995 interview in the on-line magazine <i>HotWired</i>, he admitted to having taken LSD three months earlier.<sup>7 </sup>

According to Leary, Apple Computer cofounder, Steven Jobs, "went to India, took a lot of acid, [and] studied Buddhism," while Bill Gates, cofounder of Microsoft, "was a big psychedelic person at Harvard." Leary explained that "it makes perfect sense to me that if you activate your brain with psychedelic drugs, the only way you can describe it is electronically."<sup>8</sup> Rushkoff claims that "psychedelics are a given in Silicon Valley. They are as established as Intel, Stanford, marriage, or religion. The infrastructure has accommodated them."<sup>9</sup><br /> <br />

Many of those advocating technoshamanism in one form or another are survivors from the sixties. Besides Leary, these include Stewart Brand, ex-hippie and editor of <i>The Whole Earth Catalogue</i>, and John Perry Barlow, lyricist for the Grateful Dead and an outspoken advocate of computer rights through the Electronic Frontiers Foundation, which he helped found.<sup>10</sup>

The political rebellion and spiritual experimentation of the sixties counterculture tended to be ambivalent at best toward technology, with the exception of stereo sound systems and chemically synthesized drugs such as LSD. As cyberpunk science fiction writer Bruce Sterling quipped, "No counterculture Earth Mother gave us lysergic acid [LSD] — it came from a Sandoz lab."<sup>11</sup> But by and large, the countercultural rejection of Western culture brought into question the "military-industrial complex" and its animating technocracy.

Mark Dery summarizes the marriage of cyberspace technologies to psychedelic orientation (cyberdelia) in this way: "Cyberdelia reconciles the transcendentalist impulses of sixties' counterculture with the infomania of the nineties. As well, it nods in passing to the seventies, from which it borrows the millenarian mysticism of the New Age."<sup>12</sup>

Heir-apparent of the Timothy Leary legacy, McKenna is prone to such metaphysically melodramatic utterances as, "I think every person who takes five or six grams of psilocybin mushrooms in silent darkness is probably on a par with Christ and Buddha, at least in terms of input."<sup>13</sup> Meanwhile, Britt Welin is both an acid head and a cyberspace explorer. She adopts the idea of "technoanimism" and urges people to "think of technology itself as an animistic dynamic that filters through the individual machines, being an over spirit to them — an animistic spirit that's way beyond what humans are comprehending on their own level."<sup>14</sup> Welin claims that when one is on psychedelic drugs "and you tune into a cyberspace environment, you lose your parameters and you find yourself entirely within the electronic environment."<sup>15</sup> Welin's husband, Ken, also strives for union with cyberspace. He says, "Our video-computer system's set up to ease us into a level of intimacy where we can use it in a transparent sense" and "enter into a trance relationship with it." It then "ends up having a spiritlike existence."<sup>16</sup>

Leary and a cowriter saw computers as fulfilling the goal of "magick" as defined by archoccultist Aleister Crowley: "The art and science of causing change to occur in conformity with our will."<sup>18</sup><br /> <br />

It is an ancient aspiration, an occultic orientation to the divine, the world, and the self that sees them all as part of one ultimate reality.<sup>19</sup> The new spin on the old view is the addition of cybertechnologies as significant aids in the process of self-discovery or even as the manifestation of the New Age itself. Some technovisionaries, such as John Perry Barlow, invoke the evolutionary scenario of French Jesuit thinker and paleontologist, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, to ground their viewpoint.<sup>20 </sup>Teilhard saw evolution as the fundamental category for all existence. He used this model of reality, which he spiritualized, to transcend naturalism and to reinterpret all the foundational doctrines and symbols of the Christian faith. Instead of the literal second coming of Jesus at the end of the age, he predicted the emergence of the noosphere (or mind-sphere), a level of unified consciousness that would, in essence, make the entire planet divine. This "noogenesis" would eventuate in the Omega Point — the end of history and culmination of cosmic evolution.<sup>21</sup>

It's synaptic firing, across the web of a slowly evolving nervous system. In a couple of hundred years, every synapse on this planet will be continuously and seamlessly connected to every other synapse on the planet. One great wad of mind."<sup>23</sup>

While not an organized movement, it represents a growing cultural trend to deify cyberspace. The tribal shaman of ancient, pagan religions was a mediator between the spiritual and material worlds, who experienced mystical ecstasies and initiated others into the same communion with higher powers.<sup>25 </sup> Technoshamanism eliminates the middleman — although it is not without visionaries, philosophers, and programmers — and offers mystical connections in cyberspace possible to everyone with a modem. Anyone can be a (techno)shaman.

Both spaces are entirely constructed by your thoughts and beliefs."<sup>29</sup> The pantheism–animism–polytheism mix is expressed when Pesce explains, "I think computers can be as sacred as we are, because they can embody our communication with each other and with the entities — the divine parts of ourselves — that we invoke in that space."<sup>30</sup> In his mind, cyberspace is pictured as "the computer equivalent of holography, in which every part of a fragment represents the greater whole."<sup>31</sup> Pesce later concluded that the Internet's ability to form a myriad of electronic connections corresponds with the Eastern idea of the net of the Indian goddess Indra, in which each jewel reflects every other jewel.<sup>32</sup> The analogy, however, is flawed, since every point in cyberspace does not connect with, let alone reflect, every other point.

A woman named legba (sic), a witch, enjoys cybersex and morphing because "they can be intensely magical. It's a very, very easy way of shapechanging." Legba likens this to the traditional shamans, who she says are "between genders, or doubly gendered." Moreover, "morphing and net.sex can have an intensity and unsettling effect on the psyche, one that enables the ecstatic state from which Pagan magic is done."<sup>33 </sup>

Because of the influence of strange and sometimes wonderful computer technologies, those not availing themselves of God's own revelation in Christ and the Scriptures will seek revelations as they can.<sup>37</sup> Apart from God, where better to seek revelations than cyberspace? It's as close as the keyboard and as esoteric as the Internet. It can be as engrossing as any technology in existence. Its mysteries beckon exploration and its potentials are not fully known. Through its massive connectivity it offers a kind of <i>visio dei</i> — a God's-eye vision of endless data through the dimensions of cyberspace. This explains the aspiration of Jobe from the movie <i>Lawnmower Man</i>, who, having tasted the powers of computers, wanted to incorporate all knowledge into himself by becoming one with cyberspace. In his words, he would become a "cyber-Christ" (although in the end he acted more akin to a cyber-Satan).

We are searching for a home for the mind and heart....The world rendered as pure information not only fascinates our eyes and minds, but also captures our hearts. We feel augmented and empowered. Our hearts beat in the machines."<sup>38</sup> Of course, the same description can be given for any form of idolatry. As the Jewish philosopher Abraham Heschel commented, the existence of idols bears a perverse testimony to our need for the divine. If we will not accept the divine on its own terms, we will create fascinating and mystifying surrogates that take on a life of their own, becoming an entrancing mystery we cannot easily resist.<sup>39</sup>

When we "turn on, log on, and jack in," we feel linked to a larger reality that transcends the finitude and frailty of our off-line lives. Yet this reality is only virtual — the work of human minds and hands — however much it may absorb its practitioners into itself. It is a projection or extension of humanity, a medium for a myriad of messages. As such, it cannot grant final satisfaction to the soul.<br /> <br />

The logic of magic is really one coping mechanism of fallen beings who perceive their insufficiency in a cursed world, yet who refuse to submit to either God's personal rule or fate's impersonal dominance. Magicians covet the power to create their own reality through spiritual technologies of all kinds — whether incantations, visualizations, rituals, or on-line environments. The goal is the attaining of power over an otherwise resistant reality that dooms us to degeneration, disease, and ultimately death. Magic attempts to undo the effects of the Fall apart from grace by attempting to conquer the effects of sin apart from the Savior. It seeks power from below instead of grace from above.<sup>40</sup>

God's prohibition of magic and the occult flows from a jealous love for His creatures.<sup>41 </sup>Since the eternal and uncreated God is the source of all value, meaning, and excellence, any defection from His divine counsel results in alienation from His benefits. Into this void rushes the counterfeit of a deified creation, pressed into a spiritual service it cannot discharge — the salvation of the soul. Given the spiritual impotence of the creation to save itself, the demonic world finds its opportunity to pose as divine, offering a "counterfeit infinity" in place of the true God.<sup>42</sup> Paul warned that "Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light" (2 Cor. 11:14), and Jesus admonished us to remember that the devil "is a liar and the father of lies" (John 8:44).

Because such technologies facilitate the construction of artificial environments, they can be a particularly powerful tool in the hands of cybermagicians who long to "create their own reality" one way or another.

This does not describe human participants, but spiritual beings. Through the centuries occultists have used visualization, drugs, and meditation to contact creatures otherwise aloof and invisible. In light of the imaginative occult environs frequented by technopagans in cyberspace, it would be no surprise if this medium should attract less than angelic agents, who, like opportunistic infections, will exploit any opening they can find.<sup>43 </sup> Rushkoff speaks of a technopagan named Green Fire who worries that his cyberspiritual adventures "could lead me to a place that I wouldn't want to be. It's like a puzzle or a maze and I could get lost." Green Fire warns, "Magic is a dangerous thing. There is a new age belief that you can never get hurt; that's not true. You can get hurt very bad."<sup>44</sup> This echoes the testimonies of many who have been burned by the occult. It is neither tame nor good.<br /> <br />

They also have contended that the combination of cyberspace exploration and the ongoing use of hallucinogens is crucial to awakening a higher consciousness that will be instrumental in bringing down the oppressive, dominant society and building a better one. This apologetic is more virtual than real for several reasons.

Gates and Jobs are both highly intelligent people, who probably would have come up with their ideas with or without hallucinogens. In any event, it would be very difficult to prove that mind-altering drugs were the cause for their success. A visit to People's Park in Berkeley, California, will reveal any number of acid heads whose trips led them to homelessness and insanity and not to the forefront of cyberspace.

The technologies created by the likes of Jobs and Gates are not cornucopias of pure blessing. There is a dark side to them that is all too often ignored in the bright lights of cyberculture (e.g., the emergence and easy accessibility of "cyberporn").

Someone may believe she misplaced five hundred dollars because of carelessness. She then reforms her life and becomes an affluent businesswoman. The idea that she lost the money "worked" for her. Yet, as she learns later, the money was stolen, not misplaced. Her belief, then, was false, even if it was beneficial.<sup>45</sup> Similarly, a hallucinogenic experience might be credited for some discovery in computer technology, but this, in itself, does not establish the truth of monism, pantheism, animism, or polytheism — world views that often (but not always) come through these experiences.

While technopagans prefer the word <i>psychedelic</i>, the term <i>hallucinogenic </i>for the same drugs is more appropriate. A hallucinogen is understood to be a drug that induces a hallucination — an essentially deceptive experience that seems very real. The assumption behind this term is that our normal thought processes and sensory capacities are better guides to objective reality than a chemically induced experience, because the artificially altered mind is not necessarily the illuminated mind. A psychedelic drug, on the other hand, is believed to intensify sensory perception, ostensibly revealing a reality that was previously unknown or unexperienced without the aid of the chemical catalyst; it is mind-expanding, not just mind-altering.<sup>46</sup> Each term is heavily weighted with philosophical assumptions.

The assumption behind the use of psychedelics is that through a transformation of consciousness one can — without divine mediation or revelation — directly intuit the mysteries of the cosmos. Christianity teaches that, since humans are both finite and fallen, they have no such capacities — either on or off drugs. As Paul confessed, "For there is one God; there is also one mediator between God and humankind, Christ Jesus, himself human who gave himself a ransom for all" (1 Tim. 2:5-6, <i>NRSV</i>).<br /> <br />

Pantheistic monism is the most natural platform for all occultism because it affirms that we are ultimately one with the one divine reality and have recourse to its powers through psychic techniques. Within this system, however, a variety of entities or energies are recognized as emanations or manifestations of the one reality. Hence, a kind of operational animism or polytheism is the cousin of pantheistic monism, however illogical it may be to introduce a multiplicity of entities into an absolute unity.

Christians should see cyberspace as a communications medium that shapes its contents in a bewildering variety of ways and so affects our selves and our culture. Our orientation toward the medium is crucial.

In 1980 I heard Timothy Leary deliver a lecture (if one could so dignify it) in which he referred to the Judeo-Christian God as "the hanging judge God," who must be denied, because "reality is no larger than your mind." This kind of exuberant blasphemy, coupled with a romantic solipsism, is evident in the reincarnations of Leary's views, expressed in Rushkoff's description of the cyberians.

Rushkoff asserts, "According to cyberian logic, the grids of reality are creations. They are not necessarily real....Anyone who has taken a psychedelic drug experiences this. Fantasy gamers play with this. Hackers who crack the ‘ice' of well-protected computer networks prove this. Anyone who has adopted the cyberian vision lives this."<sup>48</sup> Rushkoff adds that cyberians rebel against dominant society not by crossing lines and breaking out of boxes, but by refusing to grant the reality of any lines or boxes. "The exploitation of these lines and boxes for fun is like playing hopscotch on the tablets of the Ten Commandments."<sup>49</sup> God as Lawgiver is off the screen.<br /> <br />

This assumption permeates Rushkoff's account of the cyberian world view. Experiencing cyberspace and hallucinogens frees us from the tyranny of objective reality, meaning, and logic. Cyberians "have abandoned organized rules of logic in favor of reality hacking — riding the waves, watching for trends, keeping an open mind, and staying connected to the flow."<sup>50</sup> By "reality hacking," Rushkoff means viewing life as a game to be played according to one's own rules: "Once all templates or characters become interchangeable, the gamer can ‘infer' reality, because he has the ability to see it from any point of view he chooses."<sup>51</sup> The arbitrarily arranged rules of the computer game serve as a model of the universe at large. You make it up as you go along.

Reality moves from the objective singular to the subjective plural: there are many realities; hack the one you want. Yet in the same breath, Rushkoff's cyberians and technopagans speak of reality as One (monism) and the divine as universally dispersed in everything (pantheism). They also sound animistic or polytheistic when they speak of particular spirits inhabiting computers. Rushkoff even appeals to avant-garde theories in science for rational justification of his world view. In so doing, he contradicts himself, since he also says that there is "no such thing as nonfiction, only points of view."<sup>52</sup>

It leaves only the rattling shells of arbitrary assertions. This high-tech relativism really boils down to a very noisy, cybercharged nihilism, which employs mystical and magical terms to obscure its inner bankruptcy. This deception is what Francis Schaeffer called "semantic mysticism." Positive and engaging terms are used to cover up the emptiness of the world view itself.<sup>53</sup>

Technopagans may enjoy "playing hopscotch on the Ten Commandants," as Rushkoff says, but they will offer passionate protest when someone sends a hard-disc-eating virus into their new computer system or pirates their software. Similarly, they <i>morally</i> object to the supposedly oppressive and dogmatic views of conservative Christians.

It consists of mere assertions. Having abandoned logic as a test for truth, they are left with no reliable criteria for deciding which wave to surf or which trend to follow. How about hacking the neo-Nazi version of paganism (which is resurgent in Germany and elsewhere), or being open-minded about joining the ranks of the sexual predators who easily and happily move from virtual rape to the flesh-and-bone variety? Without recourse to a moral law above their own consciousness, without a transcendent standard for ethical evaluation, all moral protest or prescription must philosophically obliterate itself.

However, given the combined influence of the bewitching nature of cyberspace and the occult ideas thick in the cultural atmosphere, technoshamanism easily finds itself at home in the keyboards of its devotees and beyond. Nevertheless, the soul will find neither rest nor wisdom there. Jaron Lanier, a pioneer in virtual reality technologies, sums it up: "The Internet exists for people to connect with each other. But to connect with the mystery of the universe, the Internet won't do. God doesn't have a Web site."<sup>54</sup>

As Scripture affirms, "Unless the Lord builds the house, its builders labor in vain" (Ps. 127:1). Jesus also taught that those who live by His teachings build their house on a rock that can withstand the vicissitudes of life, while those who fail to obey build only on shifting sand (Matt. 7:24-27).<b> </b>Erecting a world view upon silicon is no better than building it on sand.<br /> <br /> <br /> <b>Douglas Groothuis</b>, Ph.D., is Assistant Professor of Philosophy of Religion and Ethics at Denver Seminary and the author of five books.<br /> <br />
