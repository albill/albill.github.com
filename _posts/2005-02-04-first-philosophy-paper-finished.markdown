<p>The first paper for Philosophy is done. Kee-rist!</p>
<p>I found up rewriting, oh, something like three times. I think I spent 
something like six or so hours on a paper that turned out to be six pages long.</p>
<p>I realized that the following really meant write a bunch of my own take on 
things as informed by the reading instead of just summarizing the contents of 
the introductions for each of the six sections:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>In this assignment, you are being asked to show some rudimentary 
	understanding of the following issues/problems: freedom/determinism, God and 
	religion, morality and society, state and society, mind and body, and 
	knowledge and science. In this assignment, you are not expected to discuss 
	the issues or comment on any of the reading selections; your goal in writing 
	these brief descriptions of the problems surrounding the various issues is 
	to show that you understand what the issues and problems are. In your essay, 
	try to articulate the questions that provoke controversy. You should draw on 
	your reading of Nagel, as well as from the introductions in Burr/Goldinger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I then had to edit for length and clean it up a bit. I&#39;m not entirely happy 
with the final results. It&#39;s so short when I have, after you take out the 
header, something like 3/4 of a page (double-spaced) for each topic. Some of the 
introductions are four or five pages in a large size book, so that isn&#39;t so bad, 
but two of them are more than ten pages. It&#39;s hard to condense the essence of 
problems for a large introduction into 3/4 of a page.</p>
<p>The rest of the class is three papers, one every three weeks, in which I read 
one of the six chapters for each. From each of these, I select one of the 
contemporary issues under that theme, and write a four to six page paper on that 
theme. &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; in the section for &quot;Morality and Society&quot; is an 
example (it includes a paper by C. S. Lewis).</p>
<p>Now we&#39;ll see how much of a nazi the professor is. I do think that the 
wording of the problems could be easier but I expect that I&#39;ll ask my prof some 
questions.</p>
<p>Next up: Seven page introductory history theory paper for my History class. 
It&#39;s due by next Friday (2/11) and I can e-mail it to the prof as well. I should 
be able to get much of that done this weekend (I hope). </p>
