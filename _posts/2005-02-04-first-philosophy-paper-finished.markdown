The first paper for Philosophy is done. Kee-rist!

I found up rewriting, oh, something like three times. I think I spent
something like six or so hours on a paper that turned out to be six
pages long.

I realized that the following really meant write a bunch of my own take
on things as informed by the reading instead of just summarizing the
contents of the introductions for each of the six sections:

> In this assignment, you are being asked to show some rudimentary
> understanding of the following issues/problems: freedom/determinism,
> God and religion, morality and society, state and society, mind and
> body, and knowledge and science. In this assignment, you are not
> expected to discuss the issues or comment on any of the reading
> selections; your goal in writing these brief descriptions of the
> problems surrounding the various issues is to show that you understand
> what the issues and problems are. In your essay, try to articulate the
> questions that provoke controversy. You should draw on your reading of
> Nagel, as well as from the introductions in Burr/Goldinger.

I then had to edit for length and clean it up a bit. I'm not entirely
happy with the final results. It's so short when I have, after you take
out the header, something like 3/4 of a page (double-spaced) for each
topic. Some of the introductions are four or five pages in a large size
book, so that isn't so bad, but two of them are more than ten pages.
It's hard to condense the essence of problems for a large introduction
into 3/4 of a page.

The rest of the class is three papers, one every three weeks, in which I
read one of the six chapters for each. From each of these, I select one
of the contemporary issues under that theme, and write a four to six
page paper on that theme. "Crime and Punishment" in the section for
"Morality and Society" is an example (it includes a paper by C. S.
Lewis).

Now we'll see how much of a nazi the professor is. I do think that the
wording of the problems could be easier but I expect that I'll ask my
prof some questions.

Next up: Seven page introductory history theory paper for my History
class. It's due by next Friday (2/11) and I can e-mail it to the prof as
well. I should be able to get much of that done this weekend (I hope).
