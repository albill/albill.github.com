Well, after being trapped at work for a couple of extra hours (traffic was backed up on 520 all the way to Redmond) and being forced to eat greasy pizza there, I managed to get over to Seattle. My quest? To find a particular scholastic book that I discovered this weekend which was supposed to be in the UW library.

The book in question is <em><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=075460408X">Iamblichus' de Mysteriis: A Manifesto of the Miraculous</a></em> by Emma Clarke. This is a new scholastic work dealing with Iamblichus' <em><a href="http://www.esotericarchives.com/oracle/iambl_th.htm">De Mysteriis</a></em>, one of the few surviving books dealing with theurgy from antiquity by one of the last great Neoplatonists. I've been studying aspects of theurgy off and on for years now as research for my own spiritual and magical practices.  will be happy if I ever decide to write a paper on it, I'm sure. <strong>;-)</strong>

Emma Clarke has also apparantly translated <em>De Mysteriis</em> recently as well. This would be phenomenal for me because the last translation is the one I link to above, done at the beginning of the 20th centuries and its only ok. The only translation into English before that was by Thomas Taylor, which is the one I own now and the only one in print and he did his almost 200 years ago. Clarke is apparantly a good scholar and quite sympathetic to the material. Part of her discussion in the book above is about how various things with Iamblichus have been misunderstood by scholars with an anti-spiritual bias.

I photocopied her book (it's only 130-something pages and I can get two pages on a side of a sheet) because it's $59 to buy and I can't spend that on this book right now. I then went through her bibliography and took a bunch of notes. I've tracked down a bunch of interesting articles on Iamblichus and Theurgy that the UW has been I got this done at 10:15 and the library with them closed at 10:00. I'll have to go back later this week...

Woo hoo! Days like this remind me that I was supposed to have gone to Graduate School and I never quite made it.
