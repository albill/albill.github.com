The site and parent organization are an attempt to address the problems of Global Warming and, with this, sustainability, from a Buddhist perspective. The site is predominantly (well, entirely, right now) from the viewpoint of Tibetan Buddhism but I think its ideas are applicable more widely than that particular tradition. Among the many documents on the site, I found this aspirational prayer from Thrangu Rinpoche, a great teacher whose work I greatly value: <blockquote>

May all their aims be fulfilled, in accordance with the sacred teachings!

I highly recommend that people check the site out and really think about what it says. I also to see other spiritual practitioners, especially Buddhists, endorse these sorts of views (even if not these specific ones).
