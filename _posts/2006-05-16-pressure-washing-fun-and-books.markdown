Since we have been having record heat the last few days, I decided it was a good time to do the pressure washing I wanted to do on the outside of the house. I have some touch-up painting to do and the cleaning is necessary for it (but it has to dry, which is hard in this climate).

I did that this morning along with watering the dirt where we are trying to grow grass (the ex-hole for the outdoor swimming pool, now filled in).

None of this is terribly exciting though, is it? :-)

On a positive note, I finished Kim Stanley Robinson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553803123/"><strong>Fifty Degress Below</strong></a>, the sequel to his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553585800/"><strong>Forty Signs of Rain</strong></a>, last night. I've started reading Robert Metzger's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441012418/"><strong>Cusp</strong></a>, which I have had for a year but never gotten around to reading. As a side effect of packing my library up, I've needed to decide what books I will need over the next month or so. This includes a bit of air travel as well as driving down to California. I wouldn't want to be cut short.

I've selected <strong>Cusp</strong>, then Ian McDonald's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591024366/"><strong>River of Gods</strong></a>, the last two (which were really one book) of Peter Watt's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765307219/"><strong>Behemoth</strong></a> books. I also have my Rousseau for school and a few books on Japanese Buddhism. That ought to be enough.

I've also put Windows XP back on my Dell laptop. I had tried Kubuntu for a while but I wasn't grooving on it. Since my primary home computer is one of the new duo core Mac Minis, I think I'm working on unusual (for me) operating systems enough at the moment. I must say that I really am enjoying the Mac Mini but I'm missing some of my favorite programs. I need recommendations for the essential programs that one really needs to have and I want them to be universal binary. It is bad enough that Office runs as a Power PC program and must be translated (which slows it down).
