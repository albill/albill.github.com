Since we have been having record heat the last few days, I decided it
was a good time to do the pressure washing I wanted to do on the outside
of the house. I have some touch-up painting to do and the cleaning is
necessary for it (but it has to dry, which is hard in this climate). I
did that this morning along with watering the dirt where we are trying
to grow grass (the ex-hole for the outdoor swimming pool, now filled
in). None of this is terribly exciting though, is it? :-) On a positive
note, I finished Kim Stanley Robinson's [**Fifty Degress
Below**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553803123/), the sequel to
his [**Forty Signs of
Rain**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553585800/), last night. I've
started reading Robert Metzger's
[**Cusp**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441012418/), which I have
had for a year but never gotten around to reading. As a side effect of
packing my library up, I've needed to decide what books I will need over
the next month or so. This includes a bit of air travel as well as
driving down to California. I wouldn't want to be cut short. I've
selected **Cusp**, then Ian McDonald's [**River of
Gods**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591024366/), the last two
(which were really one book) of Peter Watt's
[**Behemoth**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765307219/) books. I
also have my Rousseau for school and a few books on Japanese Buddhism.
That ought to be enough. I've also put Windows XP back on my Dell
laptop. I had tried Kubuntu for a while but I wasn't grooving on it.
Since my primary home computer is one of the new duo core Mac Minis, I
think I'm working on unusual (for me) operating systems enough at the
moment. I must say that I really am enjoying the Mac Mini but I'm
missing some of my favorite programs. I need recommendations for the
essential programs that one really needs to have and I want them to be
universal binary. It is bad enough that Office runs as a Power PC
program and must be translated (which slows it down).
