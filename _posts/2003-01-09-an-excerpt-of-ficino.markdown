An excerpt from *The Book of the Sun* by our departed and wise spiritual
ancestor, Marsilio Ficino: **Chapter IX: The Sun is the Image of God.
Comparison of the Sun to God**

> Having very diligently considered these things, our divine Plato named
> the Sun the visible son of Goodness itself. He also thought that the
> Sun was the manifest symbol of God, placed by God himself in this
> worldly temple so that everyone everywhere could admire it above all
> else. Plato and Plotinus said that the ancients venerated this Sun as
> God. The ancient gentile theologians placed all their gods in the Sun,
> to which Iamblichus, Julian and Macrobius testify. Certainly whoever
> does not view the Sun in the world as the image and minister of God,
> has certainly never reflected upon the night, nor looked upon the
> rising Sun; nor has he thought how extraordinary this is, nor how
> suddenly those things which were thought to be dead return to life.
> Nor has he recognised the gifts of the Sun through which it alone
> accomplishes that which the surrounding stars cannot. Therefore also
> consider, together with the Platonists and Dionysius, that Phoebus,
> the chief intelligence of the Muses, is the visible image of God. Also
> that Phoebe, that is, the Moon, is the image of Phoebus almost in the
> same way that he is of God. And as Hipparchus says, she is the mirror
> of the Sun in that light falling on her from the Sun deflects onto us.
> It is not appropriate to discuss it at present, but we must not
> overlook that Platonic comparison which I have described more fully
> elsewhere.In the same manner as the Sun generates both eyes and
> colours, giving the eyes the power by which they may see, and colours
> the potency by which they are seen, and joining both of them together
> with a uniting light, so God is thought to be with respect to all
> meanings and intelligible things. God in fact created the intelligible
> species of things and intellects, giving them an appropriate natural
> power. Moreover the Sun daily pours out a universal light through
> which it excites to mutual action the virtues of both the intelligible
> and intellectual realms, and joins them together through action. Plato
> calls this light truth with respect to intelligible things, and
> knowledge with respect to the mind of man. He thinks moreover that the
> good itself, that is God, surpasses all these things, just as the Sun
> is superior to light, eyes and colours. But when Plato says that the
> Sun prevails over the whole visible realm, doubtless he alludes to an
> incorporeal Sun above the corporeal one - that is, the divine
> intellect. Seeing that it really is possible to ascend to the
> archetypal pattern partly by the taking away of that which is worse
> and partly by the adding of what is better, take from the Sun - from
> whom Averroes took gross physical matter - all definite quantity. But
> leave it with the potency of light, so that there will remain the
> light itself, cleansed by miraculous power, defined neither by a
> definite quantity nor by any definite shape, filling with its presence
> a space immense with respect to the imagination. This pure light
> exceeds the intelligence just as in itself sunlight surpasses the
> acuity of the eyes. In this way, in proportion to the strength you
> receive from the Sun, you will almost seem to have found God, who
> placed his tabernacle in the Sun. And finally just as nothing is more
> alien to the divine light than utterly formless matter, so nothing is
> more different from the light of the Sun than the earth. Therefore
> since bodies in which the earthly condition prevails are most unsuited
> to light, they accept no light within. This is not because the light
> may be powerless to penetrate - for while this light cannot illuminate
> inside wool or a leaf, it may however penetrate a crystal in a moment,
> which cannot be easily penetrated by anything else. In this way the
> divine light also shines in the darkness of the soul but the darkness
> comprehends it not. Is this not also similar to God, who first sows
> knowledge of divine things in angelic and blessed minds, and then
> love? Indeed God kindles a love for us believers here which purifies
> and converts, before it bestows the intelligence of divine things.
> Thus the Sun completely fills with light clear and pure natures
> everywhere, as if they are now, for a moment, heavenly; while those
> opaque and material natures it first warms and kindles with its light,
> then refines, and soon illuminates. And sometimes it elevates to the
> heights through heat and light this matter now made light and
> accessible. Hence Apollo pierces the dense body of the Python with the
> stings of his rays, purges it, dissolves it and raises it up. Nor must
> we forget that in whatever manner we hope that Christ will finally
> come into his kingdom, resurrecting human bodies from the earth with
> the splendour of his own body, similarly after the yearly dead winter,
> we look forward to the Sun's reign in Aries, which will recall to life
> seeds of things on earth, as if suddenly reviving dead or half-alive
> animals to life and beauty. Hence Mercurius, as the arms bearer of the
> Sun, is said to excite those who sleep with his caduceus, and Plato
> describes an almost similar resurrection in his book on the Kingdom.
