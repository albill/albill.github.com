Sensei Gudo Nishijima has announced on his blog that Brad Warner is now
his successor as the leader of Dogen Sangha International. Nishijima
Sensei is a Zen priest and is Brad Warner's teacher. The announcement is
as follows:

> ### [Decision of the next leader in Dogen Sangha
> International](http://gudoblog-e.blogspot.com/2007/07/decision-of-next-leader-in-dogen-sangha.html)
>
> Dear All Members of Dogen Sangha International, As you know, about 2
> and a half years ago, I have crushed my lower spine accidentally, and
> even though such damage has been cured year by year, having become 87
> years old, my physical condition has become weaker and weaker
> gradully. Therefore I have been thinking to select the next leader in
> DSI, and researched the problem from many kinds of viewpoints, and at
> last I decided to select Ven Brad Warner as my successor in DSI.
> Therefore, yesterday, that is, 9th, July, 2007, I have requested him
> to become the Leader of DSI, and I have got his affirmative answer. So
> we will begin our talks about the principles of DSI activity,
> therefore I would like to listen to all members' opinions on DSI
> activity. Of course there is no problem for every group in DSI to
> continue the former activities, and we will gradually identify them
> together. Therefore I hope all members in DSI will express your own
> opinions about miscellaneous problems to me directly, and we will
> think about the further expansion of DSI totally. With best wishes
> Gudo Wafu Nishijima

As much as I've given Warner a lot of crap about certain stances or
actions of his, I do wish him the best in this role. Since he has been
the center of some discussion recently, it seemed worth noting here.
