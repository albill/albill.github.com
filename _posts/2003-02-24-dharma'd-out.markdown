Alright, I've had enough rides on the Mandala Merry-go-round for at least a week or three. I have now received my first root tantra empowerment. As a special bonus, I received a test transmission of a Shitro practice with the instructions that I (and anyone else there) can do it if we wish. (There is quite a Shitro practice group that meets locally with a lot of overlap.) I've spent about 20 or so hours sitting in about two feet by two feet of space on a nice meditation cushion. If I wasn't a Westerner raised with chairs, my hips would probably feel a lot better right now. ;-) All in all, it went quite well and I'm quite happy for the experience of taking it. Kilung Rinpoche is a good lama and it was a good group of people. I just found out that the monks visiting to do the Sand Mandala over the next week and a half at the Asian Art Museum are sponsoring a series of empowerments this week: <ul>
          <li>
            Monday - Lion-faced Chenrezei (?? Never heard of this Chenrezei)
          </li>
          <li>
            Wednesday - White Zambhala
          </li>
          <li>
            Friday - 21 Tara
          </li>
        </ul> I may go Friday. I'd consider tomorrow if I'd had an evening with R since Wednesday...
