<font size="12"><em><strong>AAAAAHHH!!! HOMER!!!! AAAAAAHHHH!!!! PLATO!!!!!</strong></em></font> Socrates just never shuts the fuck up, does he? Damn bandy-legged Greek know-it-all. I think it's time for me to read some science fiction and play with my cat. My draft is now at fourteen pages (for a twelve to fifteen page paper). This means, when I'm done, I'll have to go back and excise a couple of pages from my longwinded prose... Stick a fork in me for the moment. Hell, I haven't even gotten to the Republic yet within the paper.
