R and I bought our tickets for <a href="http://www.pantheacon.org/">PantheaCon</a> this week. We also booked our room (in the same wing as everyone else this time) and bought our plane tickets. So, we expect to see many of our Bay Area friends soon in February.

This will be the third time that I have gone and the second time for R. My mother will be presenting at the con (opposite Lon Duquette), as will our friends Denny Sargent and his wife, Sophia (in separate presentations). 

This will be the first time many have seen us in person since the wedding.
