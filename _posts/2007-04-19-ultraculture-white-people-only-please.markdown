Ultraculture is a wouldbe movement around magic and improving the world
(so it claims). It is also a
[zine](http://www.ultraculture.org/index2.htm) that has recently been
put out. Most it seems to focus on watered down chaos magic. It also
apparently rejects the non-Western forms of spirituality which,
conveniently, happen to be non-White as well. A little cultural
imperialism for you? The one exception to this is an approved form of
non-specific Nath spirituality. As dkosopedia.com states in its
[entry](http://www.dkosopedia.com/wiki/Ultraculture) on Ultraculture
defines it as:

> Ultraculture is a term coined by Jason Louv in 2004, and is a cultural
> movement based around the mass interest in magic and the concordent
> need to apply it to improving our thoroughly disturbed world.
> Ultraculture specifically means two things: 1) It is the name of a
> social networking system. Specifically, the idea behind “Ultraculture”
> is to apply the Indymedia model to magic, and establish open
> city-based “scenes” based around mailing lists and web pages where
> people can link up with people in their area interested in magic,
> esotericism, consciousness evolution, etc., discuss it in terms of how
> it applies to both their own experiences and their communities, and
> then determine their level of activity and involvement within that
> growing network. Ultraculture is NOT another magical order, group or
> hierarchy, nor is it just another discussion forum; in this capacity
> it is only a social connecting system on both a local and global
> scale. Occultism has traditionally been the pursuit of the “Outsider”
> figure; Ultraculture then aims to situate magic more firmly as an
> activity of communities. [...]2) If Ultraculture can be stated as a
> simple ideology, it is “The creating of solutions through (but not
> limited to) magic.” We are not interested in opposing culture, simply
> creating our own—and hopefully funnier, more intelligent and more
> erotic—versions of culture through DIY reality solutions. (Hence the
> “Ultra.”) That which identifies itself as “counterculture” is doomed
> to fail by definition and can only find “pure” expression in acts of
> violence (in which case it acts only to further validate reactionary
> forms of government) or in “selling out”; its internal contradictions
> are far greater than any detectable within late capitalism, if a
> “counterculture” can even be said to truly exist at all. Following its
> utter collapse into self-contradiction at the end of the 1990s, the
> counterculture in the West is re-emerging as a magical power battery,
> now acting as a full replacement and upgrade for culture instead of a
> critical voice within that culture. Everything culture can do,
> Ultraculture can do better. Applies specifically to anybody using
> magic to improve the world. The full form is Global Alchemical
> Ultraculture. Ultraculture is a TURQUOISE-vMEME approach to cultural
> stimulation and growth, for those familiar with Spiral Dynamics or
> Integral theory. It aims to consolidate, utilize and respect all
> previous expressions of the human endeavor within a progression
> towards the living mystery of “life worth living” and a global culture
> worthy of being called such. Ultraculture aims simply to be a space in
> which individuals and groups can be free to dream on the social and
> global level, in the company of supportive others, and find the tools
> necessary for manifestation of those dreams.

Apparently all of this talk of dreams, community and consciousness
doesn't apply to certain spiritual traditions or people that practice
them. As a friend of mine pointed out today, there is a [long
thread](http://groups.google.es/group/ultraculture/browse_thread/thread/2b947cf51b628a87/f1100e6cabbdeac4?hl=en&)
on the [Ultraculture google
group](http://groups.google.es/group/ultraculture?hl=en) in which two of
the groups key people, Shivanath and Jason Louv (the founder), decry
voudon as being evil. Shivanath
[states](http://groups.google.es/group/ultraculture/msg/b018e2903cf5dd29?hl=en&):

> Actually, my personal right to dislike things which I think are bad
> for people is just that: a right. Crack is a Bad Drug, and while it's
> your right to do it, I'm absolutely free to say Crack is a Bad Drug.
> Voodoo is a Bad Tradition. The basic mechanism: displacement of an
> individual human consciousness from their body and temporary
> replacement with a parasitic life-force-harvesting energy - this kind
> of psychic body prostitution in payment for magical favors - is
> inherently problematic. AAAW! You say, but it was the last resort of
> the oppressed! Well, so is hiding razor blades up your bum. But when
> the crisis is over - and, believe me, the people who are at risk from
> slavery now mainly live in Africa and Eastern Europe (and, depending
> on your particular views of economic coercion, China). It's time for
> people to grow out of voodoo and start investing in approaches which
> are suited to the modern world, rather than dragging these horrible
> parasite-gods out of the Medieval Colonial Barbarism period into the
> present. They should have died with slavery, in short, and to continue
> to feed them is perpetuating part of the slave system into the present
> day, under the guise of "liberation." Being enslaved to the parasite
> gods is not freedom.

He compares Voudon to Crack and then later on
[states](http://groups.google.es/group/ultraculture/msg/ad1ac536d7736470?hl=en&):

> So, at that point, I have first hand practical experience pointing out

Previously, Shivanath had
[posted](http://groups.google.es/group/ultraculture/msg/76744090e7d36a44?hl=en&)
a diatribe against Vajrayana Buddhism:

> any kind of relationship with that part of their being, or a full

When Jason Louv was called on whether these opinions are those of
Ultraculture and whether its leaders hate Voudon and Buddhism, he
[said](http://groups.google.es/group/ultraculture/msg/43baaae26dcd9123?hl=en&):

> And nobody hates Buddhism (and it was Vajrayana being discussed, not
> Buddhism as a whole), simply exposing the very dark side that so many

> Atmanic level I love these people as emanations of the divine just

> not coming in my house claiming turf. No effin way.

He had also previously
[said](http://groups.google.es/group/ultraculture/msg/06a2f9c17b2376e8?hl=en&):

> You are misreading me. My opinions were not formed by Shivanath. My

So, there you have it. The new movement is a lot like the old movement.
Typical wannabe occultist wankers. I think this is really just Jason
trying to make a name for himself in the "occult" world, not because he
wants to make change, but because he wants to sell books. His latest
book, **Generation Hex**, has been out for a while and if he is going to
be a big name occult author and publisher, he needs to keep driving
sales and generating attention towards himself. If you do that for long
enough, no matter how bogus your ideas are, someone will pay you to keep
writing. That seems to be his plan for changing the world (well, his
world anyway). This is exactly the kind of shit that pushed me away from
occultism and into becoming a Buddhist. There was the draw of Buddhist
thought and tradition pulling me in and the craziness pushing me away. I
doubt you'll hear a Buddhist teacher (except for Brad Warner) calling
anyone an "asswipe" soon as Shivanath did in the thread when someone
disagreed. I need to go work on generating some compassion for these
fellows now because they sure need it.
