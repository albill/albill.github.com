The Cornell University Library has made a bunch of images from their collection available <a href="http://fantastic.library.cornell.edu/viewall.php">online</a>. These are largely focusing on more "fantastic" elements such as witchcraft, demons, monsters, etc. There are a lot of really neat images there. I recommend that people check it out if they are so inclined.

I've included a couple of medium sized ones below. If you select them, you'll be taken to the larger size versions. These are just sample but I've always been a sucker for a good sabbat!
