It seems that anything can be found on ebay these days with enough time
and patience. I and a number of other people, including my own teacher,
keep an eye out for mikkyo related items on ebay. Here in the United
States, it is rare to even find a statue of Fudo Myoo, let alone
anything more obscure than that. Every now and then, stuff shows up on
ebay that you wouldn't expect though. Last year, an entire Shingon
mikkyodan (altar for mikkyo rituals) for goma plus the side tables and
the sitting platform showed up. Someone's family in Oregon had it. I can
only imagine that someone's uncle or grandfather had been a Shingon or
Tendai priest secretly hidding out in Oregon. My own tokko was found on
ebay in Malaysia of all places and quite a few scrolls and statues of
Fudo Myoo and related deities have shown up. This last week, through
pure accident, I found the ritual implements necessary for the goma rite
and other mikkyo rituals were up on ebay. It wasn't even an auction but
an instant sale and not a badly marked up one at that. This was also out
of Oregon, the secret hotbed of Japanese esoteric Buddhism, it seems. I
spoke to the seller in e-mail after purchasing it and it seems his
brother in Japan buys Japanese antiques and ships them to him. After a
couple of days, this 30 pound or so package full of brass showed up.
Here is one view of the contents:

It is more compact in this photo because all of the covered bowls in the
front have lids and bases that are separate brass pieces. It all comes
apart, just like the big incense burner in the middle. I put a
[photoset](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157601633406320/)
up on my Flickr account of all of it. I'm have a premonition of a future
involving a lot of Brasso (tm).
