If anyone is looking for a DivX player like the one I found in Bangkok, I  found two on ebay while looking at Buddhist statues. These are exactly the same  as mine which means that they play any DivX or Xvid files placed on them  directly onto your television.

You'll need to get a power plug-in adapter. They take standard US voltage but  the plugs are round (like they use in Thailand and a few other places). I found  an adapter for a dollar in Bangkok that I just plugged it into the end of in  order to work. They shouldn't be hard to find.
