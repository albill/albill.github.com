I had a busy weekend. Through a program associated with my employer (and many other tech companies in the area), I have access to training in technical skills. I did a 16 hour entry level photoshop class this week (Photoshop I). There are an additional two more general photoshop classes that I could sign up for if I wanted but my next class is a 16 hour introduction to Flash class next month.

Needless to say, I did not do a lot else this weekend except get up at a reasonable hour and go to class for eight hours.

I'm working on having a more regular daily Buddhist practice. I found it very refreshing, sitting in the dark in front of my altar this evening for sitting. I need to remind myself to make a point of this every morning and evening.

Once we are in the new house, we'll be a mile from the <a href="http://berkeleyzencenter.org/">Berkeley Zen Center</a>. I'll probably start making a point of sitting with them, at least once a week if not more often.
