This seems to be Douglas Rushkoff week.

Here is another interview with him...

> *More importantly, for me, working in this medium challenges me to
> live in the place I've been writing about. It's been great to write
> about non-linear spaces by using a linear medium, but this is a chance
> to play in that space, myself. I've been arguing for years that comics
> and graphic novels are environments where extraordinarily intense
> ideas are being exchanged. This was my chance to see if the medium
> could carry some of my own more complex thought constructs.\
>  \
>  Finally, I wanted to enter the conversation. It'd take me a long time
> to explain, but Grant and I have been having a conversation for years
> about the power of magick, and the nature of reality. In a certain
> way, this is an answer to him. Little Bebe is my King Mob.*
