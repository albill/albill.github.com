From Gamegrene.com for the world of Ghyll:

> Welcome to the world of Ghyll. The basic idea is that each player
> takes on the role of a scholar, from before scholarly pursuits became
> professionalized (or possibly after they ceased to be). You are
> cranky, opinionated, prejudiced, and eccentric. You are also
> collaborating with a number of your peers -- the other players -- on
> the construction of an encyclopedia about Ghyll. Despite the fact that
> your peers are self-important, narrow-minded dunderheads, they are
> honest scholars. No matter how strained their interpretations are,
> their facts are accurate as historical research can make them. So if
> you cite an entry, you have to treat its factual content as true!
> (Though you can argue vociferously with the interpretation and
> introduce new facts that shade the interpretation.

The entry on AuroAnthropology:

> ## AuroAnthropology
>
> **AuroAnthropology** is the social-humanist study of the history of
> light and light sources in culture, in contrast to the long
> theological tradition of the [Brothers of the
> Lantern](http://gamegrene.com/wiki/Brothers_of_the_Lantern "Brothers of the Lantern").
> Modern AuroAnthropology is a fairly young science, as clear and
> objective study into light and related matters was until relatively
> recently the subject of strong taboo, if not outright persecution.
> Consider the obscure approach which a scribe of the Fylesgate Annals
> seems to think necessary in referring to the invention of
> [Andelphracian
> Lights](http://gamegrene.com/wiki/Andelphracian_Lights "Andelphracian Lights"):
> (Please forgive the translation from ternary script)
>
> > Hail Andelphracia! Hail!\
> > Seventh mayor, seven times chosen,\
> > Ripped a secret from heaven\
> > Any other would surely be smote to ash\
> > Or struck by lightning as an unrighteous thief\
> > Also, she commissioned a rather-charming clock tower\
> > Presided over festivals seven times\
> > Resolved the farm dispute fairly to either side\
> > Until you build a clock\
> > Be wary in following the example of your betters.
>
> Even in our contemporary times, the pursuit of AuroAnthropology has
> been at best considered fairly controversial. Consider this recent
> clipping from our own [Folktown
> Records](http://gamegrene.com/wiki/Folktown_Records "Folktown Records"),
> edition 312:
>
> > "Why does the Sun Shine?" - Gibbous Saunders, age 11.
> >
> > Garth Haversham (Managing Editor) replies: "Dear readers, while it
> > is the policy and mission of this publication to provide clear
> > answers to questions, in this case myself and my staff have had to
> > make a tough call--Master Saunders, ask your mother."
>
> In very recent years, however, thanks to the pioneering work of many
> scholars toiling in obscurity, a few courageous city 'docs', and the
> higher profile activities of the
> [Unquisition](http://gamegrene.com/wiki/Unquisition "Unquisition"),
> many questions about the history of portable and celestial light have
> begun to be addressed.
