I have a firearm now. Through a friend, I am now the proud owner of a
Taurus PT 92 9mm pistol. It means that I can now go target shooting with
my friends without borrowing a pistol or renting one. I have pretty
rural family on my dad's side so I I grew up shooting guns (receiving my
first rifle as a seventh birthday present) but I've never owned one as
an adult. The PT 92 is a common, workhorse 9mm.

My next order of business will be spend some time on the range with it
in the next month or so in order to get comfortable with it. Since it
hasn't been fired in quite a few years, I picked up a gun cleaning kit
earlier today and plan on giving it a good cleaning before use. I'm
pretty happy that I finally picked this up but you'd probably have to be
a person into guns in order to really grok the feeling. I know that
plenty of other people have a "guns icky!" idea and I don't fault them
for it. Different strokes for different folks and all that.
