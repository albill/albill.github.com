Moving is a bitch. Let me say that up front.

I got back from my trip last night. I've spent the entire day today stuffing my belongings, mostly books, into boxes, and dumping old shit in the trash. I've been running around like crazy today but I'm taking a beer break now. ;-)

Tomorrow morning, a bunch of my friends will show up to help me move early on. The move itself should be over pretty quickly once we get rolling though unpacking will probably take forever. I'm trying to decide when to disassemble my computer. There is no net access, not even a phone yet, at the new house. If I take my machine apart, I won't be online until I go back to work Monday. On the other hand, once we carry my desk out, sitting on the floor in an empty apartment to read e-mail loses a lot of its draw. We'll see, I suppose.

I'm still recovering from the trip and the cold that I got, somehow, while in 90+ degree heat in Southern California in the mountains. If I'd been smart, I would have done this move next weekend and just chilled all weekend here. I'm looking forward to the new place though. R and I inspected it today with the landlord and figured out what room is the bedroom, what room is the oratory, etc. The oratory is in a smallish room with the door in the west and the main window in the East wall over the front of the house. That should be nice for ritual work.

There is an unknown box supposadely installed by AT&T for the old tenants with "Apcentral" on the side. I'm wondering if it is some kind of cable broadband thing or something but I really can't tell. It's in the basement (near ground level with the outside) and has a single ethernet-like cable leading into it with the wires spliced out of it into the box at the end. I haven't traced where the other wire or wires may go yet. Anyone recognize this?
