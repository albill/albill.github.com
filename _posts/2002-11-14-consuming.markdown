I feel like such a techno-geek and consumer today... My new DVD set of the long version of the Fellowship of the Ring arrived at work yesterday. I had the last couple of days off because we shipped MSN8 (my team did the Parental Controls testing, don'tchaknow) and it was there when I got back.

Of course, the Geeky coworkers are going "oooh, neat!" but it makes me feel like yet another consumer of pap media, even if I do think it is a fine movie. R and I watched the first half (the first DVD) this evening and just finished that.

I also brought my laptop home from work with its wireless card and got to sit on the couch in the other room reading LJ and e-mail on it over the wireless. That was pretty cool but, again, it's strange in a way.

I am reading Daniel Quinn's new novel, "The Holy," right now and his work always puts me in a strange frame of mind. It's kind of like "American Gods" meets "Ishmael" in many ways. It's quite good but it is also quite good at making you question your role in the world, your career, etc. Since I'm already sick of my career in many ways, that's not always a good thing.

I think I'll go work on my Greek homework for tomorrow though.
