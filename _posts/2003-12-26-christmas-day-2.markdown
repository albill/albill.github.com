I spent the morning of Christmas Day at my grandparents place. We opened presents around 10:00 am and hung out until supper at noon. They live in a Christian Retirement Community, called "Cristwood," in Seattle and it is always rather an odd place. Supper was a buffet style dinner in their dining hall but the food was fairly decent. 

Madeline was there, as was her mother and we hung out until 2:00. They then left and I got to spend some time alone with my grandparents, which was actually fairly nice. My grandfather, a retired engineer, asked me a lot of questions about Windows and issues that he was having with various bits of aging hardware. My grandmother gave me the low down on the recent birth of a cousin of mine, the "reconciliation child" from the recovery of my uncle&apos;s marriage from his wife&apos;s infidelity. They named the child "Caleb," which has weird associations for me. heh. I rarely get to speak to my grandparents much so it was all well and good. 

About 3:30 or so, I went over to Rubylou&apos;s place  for their open Christmas house. Rubylou always opens her home on Christmas Day to all of the refugees and friends for visiting and merry-making. I ate a lot of sugary food, drank coffee, and otherwise carried on. <lj user="drakemonger"> decided that my vocal cadence, when ranting, was identical to Foamy the Squirrel&apos;s and that I am the living incarnation of Foamy. Apparantly I also was able to get off a few choice rants about driving a stake through the heart of people after kicking them in the balls and similar topics. We also discussed the pros and cons of penis size a bit. heh.

There was also a metaconversation between various LJ people about being in social situations and realizing at the time that they are fodder for an LJ post later. I said that this conversation was, itself, fodder for an LJ post and stated that I would write about it when I got home thus recursively illustrating the very situation of life becoming LJ posts in a conscious manner. (Does that make sense?)

I was able to hold the new baby for a while as well and otherwise make her coo. Sean;&apos;s back and forth with me on a variety of ranting topics that involved us flipping a huge amount of shit at each other ("hung like a baby carrot is he") seemingly amused the various parties there.

I had a good time and only left about an hour ago because of the late hour. It is always nice to see everyone and it makes me realize how much I miss hanging out with Rubylou on a regular basis (and even hanging out with Sean; on occasion). I should make a point of doing it a bit more often and being social.
