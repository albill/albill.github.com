This came in from <a href="http://www.boingboing.net">Boing Boing</a> today but I looked at it last night. I've been waiting for this installment from eSheep.com. It's one of my current favorite science fiction comic type things....

<hr width="50%" /><img src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/spiders35.jpg" align="left" height="216" width="240" /> The latest installment of Patrick Farley's brilliant alternate history of the latest Afghan War, "Spiders," is online. Don't miss this: it is hands-down the very best science fiction comics being published on the Web today.
