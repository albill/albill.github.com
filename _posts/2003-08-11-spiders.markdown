This came in from [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net) today but I
looked at it last night. I've been waiting for this installment from
eSheep.com. It's one of my current favorite science fiction comic type
things....

installment of Patrick Farley's brilliant alternate history of the
latest Afghan War, "Spiders," is online. Don't miss this: it is
hands-down the very best science fiction comics being published on the
Web today.
