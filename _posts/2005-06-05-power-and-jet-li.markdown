R and I went and bought a new dishwasher yesterday. How's that for
excitement? Then I proceeded to do some sanding and painting on part of
the exterior of the house. Woo-hoo! Around 6:00 or so, the power went
out. About two hours later, R came home and we decided to go out to
dinner. After dinner, the power was still out so we did the unusual and
went to a late movie showing. The available movie was **Unleashed** (aka
"Danny the Dog") with Jet Li. I thought it was ok though not stellar.
The fight scenes were well done but some of them were obviously added
for no obvious plot reasons (like the underground fight club). Bob
Hoskins does an excellent job as a complete bastard, probably the best
performance of the movie. R commented that Jet Li should give up on
pretending that he can act and stick to just kicking major ass. After
**The One**, I am forced to agree. I call this the "Chuck Norris
Syndrome." Take a perfectly good, even exceptional martial artist, feed
him delusions of competence in acting and the idea of a "real" acting
career and what do you get? You get things like **Walker, Texas
Ranger**. Ouch. When we came home, the power was back on. Looks like it
was out for about five hours total. Today, we are off to the annual
[Pagan Scholars Meeting](http://www.speakeasy.org/~bwilliam/sps.html)
soon. That ought to be interesting. I think I've missed one of these
since inception. Every now and then, I get something close to presenting
but I doubt, at this point, that most pagans want to hear about
comparisons between western esoteric practices and Tantric Buddhism.
