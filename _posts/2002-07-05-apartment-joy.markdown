Well, there went the hope of a relaxing evening. Phone call on my cell:

> "Hello?""Hi Al, this is Patrick." (my apartment manager) "Hi, Patrick.
> Whassup?" "I listed your apartment in the newspaper. It's in late so
> it won't show up until the Sunday edition. I expect that I'll need to
> show it a few times on Sunday or Monday. We'll just come in, look
> around for a few and leave..." *Al looks around at mounds of books,
> papers, coffee cups, cat hair, cats, dirty clothes, etc. etc. etc.*
> "Uhm, Ok. Thanks for letting me know." "Sure thing. Talk to you
> later." "Bye"

I guess I'm packing shit in boxes tonight for my move and making my
place into a not-complete-pig-sty. I haven't let the manager into my
apartment since I rented it 1 year, 11 months ago. He's **never** been
inside. heh. P.S. "Bemused" is not a mood. It should be.
