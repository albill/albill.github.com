I'm over at Seattle <a href="http://www.seattlemind.com">Mind Camp</a> 2.0 now. We started officially a couple of hours ago and I'm in a Mind Manager presentation right now.

I have seen a bunch of coworkers, including some that I haven't seen in a few years. I gave away a few pieces of old hardware and I'm made my list of sessions to attend.

I'm sure I'll blog later tonight.
