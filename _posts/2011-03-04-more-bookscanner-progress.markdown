*Gaze in awe at the completed base*

Myles and I met up before and after the weekly
[AMT](http://www.acemonstertoys.org) meeting last night to do a little
more work on the [bookscanner](http://www.diybookscanner.org). Other
than building the platen, which holds down the pages of the books and
mounting it, we're getting much closer to being done building it. It has
to rise up and down on rails and getting those squared and fitted is a
little tricky for those of us with weak wood working skills.

The real challenge is going to be the electronics to control the Canon
480 cameras. The firmware on those cameras is well hacked, which means
that we can mount them and have them each take a photo of a page (one
side of the book per camera) at the push of a button and then pull the
images directly into a Linux virtual machine that Myles has put
together.

I took a few photos but I'm hoping that we will have more impressive
looking results after another workday on it on Saturday.

*No, we are not woodworkers*
