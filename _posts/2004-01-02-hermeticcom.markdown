I've updated <a href="http://www.hermetic.com">The Hermetic Library</a> to the new layout and color scheme. This only affects three pages. All of the subsites have their own thing going on so they aren't touched.

I know some people liked the reds better but I thought I'd try this for a while. Now I just need some more content (98 MB isn't enough!).
