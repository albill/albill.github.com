Rev. Paul Lynch, my preceptor and the head of the <a href="http://www.fivemountain.org/">Five Mountain Sangha</a>, just did a <a href="http://zenmirror.blogspot.com/2010/05/amongst-white-clouds.html">blog post</a> about "<a href="http://www.amongstclouds.com">Amongst White Clouds</a>," a Buddhist documentary filmed a few years back. Since I've been posting a bit about videos, especially Buddhist documentaries recently, I thought I'd mention it as well.

It is a film about Chinese Buddhist hermits living in the Zhongnan Mountains of China. The filmmaker, Edward Burger, wanders around interviewing various hermits to ask them about their practice and why they live that way up in the mountain. It is quite interesting and the Journal of Buddhist Ethics has a <a href="http://www.buddhistethics.org/14/kirkpatrick-review.html">review</a> of it online as well that gives it a positive evaluation.

It turns out that the entire video is up on <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5902279151658995270&hl=en#">Google Video</a> as well so it can be watched online. I've embedded it below for people viewing my blog locally. Go give it a watch if you've got time to kill (and, if you're reading this, you probably do...).
