The missus is off in Las Vegas with my mom. I'm hoping that I don't get a call to bail people out of jail...

I spent the early evening getting tacos in Alameda and looking at some books that arrived. My copy of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804819777/">Pure Heart Enlightened Mind: The Zen Journal and Letters of Maura 'Soshin' O'Halloran</a>" arrived this evening. This was recommended to me highly by my friend, Rubylou. It is the transcripts of Maura O'Halloran's journals in the period leading up to being made a Roshi in Japan. Six months after that event, she was killed in a bus accident in Thailand. This was in 1982. A statue was erected to her at the monastery she trained within in northern Japan and she was revered as a saint of sorts locally (it seems).

On another note, materials from the <a href="http://www.gtu.edu/">Graduate Theological Union</a> arrived today. I asked them for information on their doctoral program for consideration after I receive my PhD. I've had at least one friend graduate from the program (maybe two) and they come highly recommended.
