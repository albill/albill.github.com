I must admit that I've been ignoring the Beijing Olympics completely.
Not only am I not inspired much by the gross commercialism which is the
modern Olympics but I find the whole idea of China hosting a supposedly
universal event to be laughable. The rioting in Tibet earlier this year
was just icing on the cake of my disdain. I fully expect some kind of
nasty international incident to happen at the Olympics this year. I can
only wait with a doomed sense of awe to see what might happen with this
many foreigners and international media all crowded together into China.
Just add a match and see what happens. I've been, loosely, predicting an
uprising amongst the Muslim turkic peoples of Western China since the
Tibetans have been pretty effectively crushed over the last few months.
As much as I admire aspects of Chinese culture, especially its Buddhist
history, I must admit to a pretty complete disdain for the modern
government.
