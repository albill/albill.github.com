Rudy Rucker, one of my favorite science fiction freaks, has his
"Transrealist Manifesto" online at
[http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/rucker/transrealistmanifesto.pdf](http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/rucker/transrealistmanifesto.pdf).
Some will note that he also has a non-science fiction out as well in the
last year.
