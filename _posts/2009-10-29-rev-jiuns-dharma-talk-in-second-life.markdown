I [blogged
recently](http://www.openbuddha.com/2009/10/16/the-dharma-of-second-life/)
about Rev. Jiun Foster doing a teaching in Second Life at
[Kannonji](http://kannonji.blogspot.com/). Unknown to me, video of the
talk was captured and it has now been put up on Youtube. You can take a
look at it below or on
[Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bwxBxOFbmE) (in much higher
resolution). All of the individuals sitting on cushions as (possibly)
goofy avatars are real people who logged into SL and came to the event,
so we had a pretty good turnout for an online event. You can see the
[second part](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy24FhlJBvU) of it on
Youtube as well. I want to thank Eti for capturing the video, editing it
and putting it up. Thanks!
