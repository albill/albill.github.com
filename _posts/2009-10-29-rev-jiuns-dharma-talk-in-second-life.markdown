I <a href="http://www.openbuddha.com/2009/10/16/the-dharma-of-second-life/">blogged recently</a> about Rev. Jiun Foster doing a teaching in Second Life at <a href="http://kannonji.blogspot.com/">Kannonji</a>. Unknown to me, video of the talk was captured and it has now been put up on Youtube. 

You can take a look at it below or on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bwxBxOFbmE">Youtube</a> (in much higher resolution). All of the individuals sitting on cushions as (possibly) goofy avatars are real people who logged into SL and came to the event, so we had a pretty good turnout for an online event.

You can see the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy24FhlJBvU">second part</a> of it on Youtube as well. 

I want to thank Eti for capturing the video, editing it and putting it up. Thanks!
