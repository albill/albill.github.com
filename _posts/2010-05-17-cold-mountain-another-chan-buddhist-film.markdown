Today I found out about another Buddhist documentary focusing on the
Chan Buddhism of China. This is "Cold Mountain: Han Shan" directed by
Mike Hazard and Deb Wallwork and it came out last year. Their is a
synopsis on the website for it:

> "Cold Mountain" is a film portrait of the Tang Dynasty Chinese poet
> Han Shan, a.k.a. Cold Mountain. Recorded on location in China, America
> and Japan, Burton Watson, Red Pine and the legendary Gary Snyder
> describe the poet's life and tell poems. A trickster, Han Shan wrote
> poems for everyone, not just the educated elite. A man free of
> spiritual doctrine, it is unclear whether or not he was a monk,
> whether he was a Buddhist or a Taoist, or both. It is not even certain
> he ever lived, but the poems do.

You can watch the entire film on
[cultureunplugged.com](http://www.cultureunplugged.com/play/2457/Cold-Mountain).
I've also embedded it below for those viewing my blog locally (not
through my feed). I've only watched the beginning portion of this so
far, since I just heard about it, but it seemed worth sharing.
