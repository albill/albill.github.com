Now that I live in the East Bay, I want to find a group to sit with at least once a week.

My own practice is Tendai but I can sit with a Zen group or with a Tibetan group doing Shamatha ("Calm Abiding") meditation, which is effectively the same as the common Zen meditation.

R and I saw a Thai Buddhist temple in Berkeley across the street from the apartment for which we applied. If we get that place, I'm likely to go there but since they are neither Mahayana or Vajrayana practitioners, I'm unlikely to make it my base of operations.

Any suggestions would be welcome.
