In a rare occurrence, the DNA Lounge in San Francisco is having shows twice in a week that I actually want to see... The last time I saw a show there was when R and I went to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Line_Assembly">Front Line Assembly</a> last year.

On August 14, they are having <a href="http://www.combichrist.com/">Combichrist</a> and <a href="http://www.imperativereaction.net/">Imperative Reaction</a> in a show. I'm a big fan of Imperative Reaction and I like Combichrist quite a bit.

On my birthday, August 19, they are having a show with <a href="http://www.androidlust.com/">Android Lust</a>. I've been wanting to see Android Lust play for quite a while so this ought to be fun.

Jisho Sensei will be visiting that weekend. Maybe he'd be up for a little Industrial...

<strong>Update:</strong> Android Lust's music can be sampled on the band's <a href="http://www.myspace.com/androidlust">myspace page</a>.
