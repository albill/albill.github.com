R and I went out to dinner after carpooling to work together today. Next
to the restaurant was a PetCo. I finally convinced her it was time for
another ferret (for those that don't know, Doodle died early in the year
of cancer) and we brought a young female home...We're debating names but
she seems pretty calm and energetic for a ferret. She's been awake for
three or so hours straight now, which is just amazing!
