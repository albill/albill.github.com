R and I went out to dinner after carpooling to work together today. Next to the restaurant was a PetCo. I finally convinced her it was time for another ferret (for those that don&apos;t know, Doodle died early in the year of cancer) and we brought a young female home...We&apos;re debating names but she seems pretty calm and energetic for a ferret. She&apos;s been awake for three or so hours straight now, which is just amazing!
