Whew. That's 40% of my grade and pretty much all that I've been doing outside of work and travel for much of the last week. I only have one paper left for this class, the hardest that I've had so far, and I'm done with my class on the "Para-Rational Perspective."

This paper can be relatively short though so I'm going to try to churn it out by the end of the weekend. That will leave me with another paper for that class (or two total) to be done by December 2.

It will be a relief to be able to sit down and just read a novel or a comic book and not feel like I should be working on schoolwork. I received the new Jon Grimwood, Justina Roberts, John Irvine, Alastair Reynolds and a number of other novels this week, mostly from the UK. I have this giant fiction backlog to work through when I get the opportunity.

(It is kind of humorous that I'm going to effectively wind up with a philosophy master's degree even if my thesis will be on Western Esotericism...) I've turned in a request for an independent study on methodology and current work on Western Esotericism for next term as well but it was only a week ago (a bit late) so it might be a couple of weeks before I hear whether it has been approved. That will take my up to my normal six semester credit workload. After Spring term, I'll only have one three credit and one single credit class before I do my thesis preparation work and begin writing my thesis (hopefully next Fall/Winter).
