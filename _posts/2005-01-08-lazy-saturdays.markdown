Today has been a quiet day so far. No new house disasters, no deaths of
loved ones.

Last night, R and I went to her annual company holiday party at
**Salty's** in West Seattle. We know a few of her coworkers from white
water rafting and other activities so I was able to communicate with a
fellow human or two. I met a fellow who did SigInt for the military,
which another friend of mine has done, so we got to have a nice little
chat. I'm apparently the first person that actually knew what SigInt was
that he had met in the normal tech crowd.

I went out this afternoon and got a deck of cards and a set of dominoes.
We didn't have any of the latter in the house and there is a Tibetan
game (which I am sure can be used for gambling) that can be played with
them that I've been wanting to try. The deck of cards is an alternative
to the normal forms of divination that I've been known to try. There is
an American tradition (possibly wider) of just using a normal deck of
cards for such things and I felt like mucking around with it. I wanted
to have a clean deck for that though.

I also bought a $10 portable tapedeck (aka "Walkman"). As it turns out,
we have nothing like it in the house and I have tapes of John Reynolds
lecturing on Tibetan Shamanism and Chagdud Rinpoche teaching on Red
Tara. I'd like to turn these into mp3 files so I can listen to them on
my ipod and otherwise get rid of the tapes, which just take up space.
Since I have a Soundblaster Audigy card, it isn't hard though I had to
have something to play the tapes... I've just done the first of four
sections of the Reynolds lecture and it seems to be working out well.

While listening to that in order to monitor recording levels (but not
listening to the lecture itself right now as I'd like to do it later),
I've been looking around Science Fiction writer websites and interviews.

I found a decent, though dated, Jon Grimwood interview at
[http://strangehorizons.com/2002/20020812/grimwood.shtml](http://strangehorizons.com/2002/20020812/grimwood.shtml).
When he speaks about his next novel, it is amusing since it turns out
that there is, in fact, a generation ship in it.

I also found some material on one of my other favorite writers, Alastair
Reynolds. I'm reading his **Century Rain** right now. The best of the
lot is at
[http://www.dragonsworn.com/features/alastairreynolds/interview.html](http://www.dragonsworn.com/features/alastairreynolds/interview.html),
and is part of the **[Nostalgia For
Infinity](http://www.dragonsworn.com/features/alastairreynolds/index.html)**
website (named after a spaceship from his books). A much older
interview, from when **Revelation Space** came out is at
[http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/27000/ref=ed\_art\_135796\_txt\_1/026-3556114-8055629](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/27000/ref=ed_art_135796_txt_1/026-3556114-8055629).

It seems that Amazon used to actually bother to do things like interview
authors. I guess they don't need to dirty themselves in that manner
anymore. They have others as well, all a few years old:

-   **[Paul
    McAuley](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/18195/ref=ed_art_135796_txt_1/026-3556114-8055629)**
-   **[Ken
    MacLeod](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/18184/ref=ed_art_135796_txt_1/026-3556114-8055629)**
-   **[Iain M
    Banks](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/67383/ref=ed_art_135796_txt_1/026-3556114-8055629)**
-   **[Peter F.
    Hamilton](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/18189/ref=ed_art_135796_txt_1/026-3556114-8055629)**

All authors that I enjoy a lot.

R and I received the first DVD from the second season of **Millenium**
today so I know what I'm going to go do next...
