<p>Today has been a quiet day so far. No new house disasters, no deaths of loved 
ones.</p>
<p>Last night, R and I went to her annual company holiday party at <b>Salty&#39;s</b> 
in West Seattle. We know a few of her coworkers from white water rafting and 
other activities so I was able to communicate with a fellow human or two. I met 
a fellow who did SigInt for the military, which another friend of mine has done, 
so we got to have a nice little chat. I&#39;m apparently the first person that 
actually knew what SigInt was that he had met in the normal tech crowd.</p>
<p>I went out this afternoon and got a deck of cards and a set of dominoes. We 
didn&#39;t have any of the latter in the house and there is a Tibetan game (which I 
am sure can be used for gambling) that can be played with them that I&#39;ve been 
wanting to try. The deck of cards is an alternative to the normal forms of 
divination that I&#39;ve been known to try. There is an American tradition (possibly 
wider) of just using a normal deck of cards for such things and I felt like 
mucking around with it. I wanted to have a clean deck for that though.</p>
<p>I also bought a $10 portable tapedeck (aka &quot;Walkman&quot;). As it turns out, we 
have nothing like it in the house and I have tapes of John Reynolds lecturing on 
Tibetan Shamanism and Chagdud Rinpoche teaching on Red Tara. I&#39;d like to turn 
these into mp3 files so I can listen to them on my ipod and otherwise get rid of 
the tapes, which just take up space. Since I have a Soundblaster Audigy card, it 
isn&#39;t hard though I had to have something to play the tapes... I&#39;ve just done 
the first of four sections of the Reynolds lecture and it seems to be working 
out well.</p>
<p>While listening to that in order to monitor recording levels (but not 
listening to the lecture itself right now as I&#39;d like to do it later), I&#39;ve been 
looking around Science Fiction writer websites and interviews.</p>
<p>I found a decent, though dated, Jon Grimwood interview at
<a href="http://strangehorizons.com/2002/20020812/grimwood.shtml">
http://strangehorizons.com/2002/20020812/grimwood.shtml</a>. When he speaks 
about his next novel, it is amusing since it turns out that there is, in fact, a 
generation ship in it.</p>
<p>I also found some material on one of my other favorite writers, Alastair 
Reynolds. I&#39;m reading his <b>Century Rain</b> right now. The best of the lot is 
at <a href="http://www.dragonsworn.com/features/alastairreynolds/interview.html">
http://www.dragonsworn.com/features/alastairreynolds/interview.html</a>, and is 
part of the <b>
<a href="http://www.dragonsworn.com/features/alastairreynolds/index.html">
Nostalgia For Infinity</a></b> website (named after a spaceship from his books). 
A much older interview, from when <b>Revelation Space</b> came out is at
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/27000/ref=ed_art_135796_txt_1/026-3556114-8055629">

</p>
<p>It seems that Amazon used to actually bother to do things like interview 
authors. I guess they don&#39;t need to dirty themselves in that manner anymore. 
They have others as well, all a few years old:</p>

<p>All authors that I enjoy a lot.</p>
<p>R and I received the first DVD from the second season of <b>Millenium</b> 
today so I know what I&#39;m going to go do next...</p>
