A wrote recently about a poem that I was trying to remember the title
of... I could only vaguely remember the last few lines. It was "Ulysses"
by Tennyson that I was trying to remember. The last section is the most
lingering in my mind...

> **We are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and
> heaven, that which we are, we are,-- One equal temper of heroic
> hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to
> seek, to find, and not to yield.**
