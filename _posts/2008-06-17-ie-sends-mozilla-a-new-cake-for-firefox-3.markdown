Sean from Microsoft came by just a few minutes ago to drop off a cake
for the Internet Explorer team. As people may recall, the IE team sent
Mozilla a cake after Firefox 2 shipped and it seems that they wanted to
continue the tradition. Sean and I used to work together and I happened
to be the one that saw him as he came in so he presented the cake to me
and John Lilly and we then took it around to staff. I think people found
it amusing and the "E" portion of the Firefox 2 cake, which is preserved
in our freezer to this day, was pulled out for comparison. I must say,
the new cake is much nicer (and much less brown) than the old one. Here
are a couple of photos from
