I am looking through the [Virupa Ecumenical
Institute's](http://www.sakya.org/vei/Spring2002/virupa.htm) calendar
and I've actually found things that I'm interested in attending. This is
new for me as their events in the past seem to have mainly academic
classes. Now, I have thought of taking a class in Tibetan but I am
interested in other things... Anyway, they had the following listed:

> **SHITRO EMPOWERMENT, TRANSMISSION, TEACHING, AND PRACTICE**H.H.
> Jigdal Dagchen Sakya Sunday, May 5 10:00 am to 5:00 pm $50 "Shitro"
> refers to peaceful and wrathful deities met in the intermediate state
> (bardo) following death. It is also a Dzogchen practice (this version
> comes from Jigme Lingpa), and very helpful to people after they have
> died, even if it has been many years since their death. *H.H. Jigdal
> Dagchen Sakya, Head Lama of Sakya Monastery*

and also:

> **TIBETAN MEDICINE: EMPHASIS ON FIRE IMBALANCE AND AGGRAVATIONS CAUSED
> BY SUMMER** Lisa Meserole, ND Monday, May 20 7:00 pm $10 Public, $8
> Sakya Monastery members $5 students and seniors (60 and over)
> Beginning and Intermediate Levels This presentation focuses on
> selected herbs and ingredients used in therapeutic formulae for
> balancing constitution (Fire, Wind, Air) and treating disease. The
> emphasis is on treatment of summertime diseases and fire constitution
> dominance and imbalance (such as nervousness and anxiety) using
> indicated foods, formulae and gems. A listing of credible resources,
> references, clinics, and schools are provided. Recommended reading:
> Health Through Balance by Dr. Dhonden. Additional references are Barry
> Clark's The Quintessence Tantras of Tibetan Medicine and Dr. Dawa's A
> Clear Mirror of Tibetan Medicinal Plants.*Dr. Lisa Meserole is a
