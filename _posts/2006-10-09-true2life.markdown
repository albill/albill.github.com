If I wasn't planning on being at Disnelyland this Saturday, I'd be going
to [Tru2Life](http://www.bavc.org/true2life). It describes itself as
follows:

> **Why True2Life?** True2Life is a unique gathering of industry and
> government leaders, educators, community service providers and young
> people. This one-day, special event has been crafted to showcase youth
> as cultural producers and the Bay Area as a model in linking youth to
> community and industry change. **Who's coming?** Digital industry
> gurus, educators, government, youth, community organizations, artists,
> animation pioneers, musicians, funders, and futurists. Be part of the
> discussionâ€”the entire day will be documented by youth production crews
> and podcasted to 24 million viewers by PodShow!

I'm especially interested in the results of the **Shakeup in
Cyberspace** panel. I'll be watching the recorded version when it is
available. The event is run by the [Bay Area Visual
Coalition](http://www.bavc.org/) (BAVC). I'm familiar with them through
classes and other training that they offer. They did a presentation at
my work on classes that we could take (state funded!) through them. I've
been looking at some video production and Flash development classes.
