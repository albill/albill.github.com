Ken Wilber is a modern philosopher-scholar whose work I tend to follow. He's notorious for not giving many interviews over the last 25 years or having public appearances, preferring to write and let his work stand for itself. There are two exceptions to this in book form. One is "Grace and Grit," which is composed largely of the journals of his late wife with some framing work by Wilber. Treya Wilber was diagnosed with cancer ten days after Ken and she married and they spent about a decade in a battle with the disease. That book is about that struggle. The other exception is "One Taste." In 1997, Ken kept a journal for a year as an experiment in recording his day to day thoughts and some of his work, specifically with the thought that he might get something interesting to publish along with the value as an experiment. "One Taste" is the collection of the entries from that year and I've been reading it this last week. In speaking with Vajranatha, we were discussing Ken Wilber's spiritual practices a bit, along with other work. While he has had many influences and teachers with various degrees of fame (or infamy, such as Adi Da or Chogyam Trungpa), he's also studied with some reputable people. I've often wondered about Ken's exposure to Dzogchen and he makes a couple of references to being taught it here and there by Chagdud Rinpoche, among others. I came across the following entry about an hour ago. (This is an excerpt from a longer piece.) I thougt it might be of interest. >From One Taste, November 11: [...] In any event, around four or five A.M. I do one or two hours of more typical meditative and contemplative practices. Even if constant consciousness is present, I try to do these practices, because they exercise and express that Song more beautifully than anything else I know. (Suzuki Roshi, when asked why we should meditate, always said the same thing: We do not meditate to attain Buddha-nature -- because, being ever-present, it is literally unattainable -- rather, we meditate to express the Buddha-nature that we always already are.) Although I have been meditating for around 25 years -- and have tried dozens of different spiritual practices -- most of those that I do at this time were received at the Longchen Nyingthig given by His Holiness Pema Norbu (Penor) Rinpoche, now head of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism. These especially include tigle gyachen and the shi tro (elaborate practices that include togyal and trekchod, the two major practices of Dzogchen or Maha-Ati Buddhism). Many of these practices were also initiated by my primary Dzogchen teacher, Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche.
