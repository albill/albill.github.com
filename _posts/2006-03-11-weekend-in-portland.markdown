R and I will be down in Portland this weekend. We're attending the
Thelemic Symposium on Saturday night. Earlier in the afternoon, I'll be
at Seket-Maat Lodge using the library there to try to get copies of some
of the material related to my thesis work. I'll also be bringing a
couple of things down for the lodge. R and I are staying at the [Mark
Spencer Hotel](http://www.markspencer.com/) a block from Powell's in
downtown so I expect to get some good book shopping in as well. We
should be back in Seattle by Sunday afternoon.
