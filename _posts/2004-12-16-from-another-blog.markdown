From *Hardcore Zen*by Brad Warner:

**

> Every single human being in the world at some time thinks that "if
> only" this or that one of our conditions could be met then we'd be
> happy. "If only I had a girlfriend/boyfriend/million bucks, then I'd
> be happy." Or in the case of the more spiritually minded: "If only I
> were enlightened, then that would settle everything once and for all."
> Think again.
>
> An old Chinese Zen Master once said, "From birth to death it's just
> like this!"
>
> Wherever you go in the world of human beings is pretty much the same.
> Only the details are different. All of my gaijin teacher friends who
> wanted to get out of Japan and back to the "real world" have
> discovered that the "real world" is hardly any different than the
> place they were leaving.
>
> We always want to believe that somewhere there's a perfect situation,
> if only we weren't barred from it. But that's not the reality.
>
> We always imagine that there's got to be somewhere else better than
> where we are right now, the great "Somewhere Else" we all carry around
> in our heads. We believe Somewhere Else is out there for us if only we
> could find it. But there's no Somewhere Else. Everything is right
> here.
