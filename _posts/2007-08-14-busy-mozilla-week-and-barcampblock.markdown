This week is a busy week at Mozilla as it is one of our regular "all
hands" weeks. This means that the roughly 50% of MoCo staff that doesn't
live local to the Bay Area will be visiting all week. We have
discussions, presentations, and roundtables every day, all day, with
multiple tracks. It also means that instead of telecommuting about half
of the week (I usually do so on Tuesdays and Fridays), I'll be making
the hour drive in all week as well. It's going to be a loooong week,
even if it should be fun.

Additionally, a number of us at Mozilla will be attending
[BarCampBlock](http://barcamp.org/BarCampBlock) this weekend.
BarCampBlock is an example of the BarCamp series of unconferences. You
can find information on a number of these occurring all over the world
on the [BarCamp website](http://www.barcamp.org). The [session
list](http://barcamp.org/BarCampBlockSessions) is looking pretty
interesting so far. So far I'm planning on attending the following ones
for sure:

-   Online communities, open source and the gift economy
-   A web app for the whole family -- How to legally engage kids and
    youths (under the age of 13).
-   Dialogue TV -- How to bring "Conversation Cafe" style dialogues to
    the web (podcast or video)

Mozilla is also proud to be one of the sponsors of BarCampBlock as well.
I was pretty active in talking to a few people internally to help get us
to sponsor though I know we've done it for other BarCamps before so it
wasn't difficult at all. People all thought it was a good idea.
Personally, I think these kinds of events are where a lot of the
interesting ideas people have in their heads around the web, open
source, and communication percolate out. I hope to see at least a few
members of the Mozilla community there. I've heard that the event is
expecting at least 400 people and that it may go as high as 800. Not bad
for a very loosely configured event on relatively short notice (at least
for most of us).
