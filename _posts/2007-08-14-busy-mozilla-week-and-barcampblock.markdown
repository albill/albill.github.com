This week is a busy week at Mozilla as it is one of our regular "all hands" weeks. This means that the roughly 50% of MoCo staff that doesn't live local to the Bay Area will be visiting all week. We have discussions, presentations, and roundtables every day, all day, with multiple tracks. It also means that instead of telecommuting about half of the week (I usually do so on Tuesdays and Fridays), I'll be making the hour drive in all week as well.

It's going to be a loooong week, even if it should be fun.

Additionally, a number of us at Mozilla will be attending <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampBlock">BarCampBlock</a> this weekend. BarCampBlock is an example of the BarCamp series of unconferences. You can find information on a number of these occurring all over the world on the <a href="http://www.barcamp.org">BarCamp website</a>.

The <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampBlockSessions">session list</a> is looking pretty interesting so far. So far I'm planning on attending the following ones for sure:
<ul>
	<li>Online communities, open source and the gift economy</li>
	<li>A web app for the whole family -- How to legally engage kids and youths (under the age of 13).</li>
	<li>Dialogue TV -- How to bring "Conversation Cafe" style dialogues to the web (podcast or video)</li>
</ul>
Mozilla is also proud to be one of the sponsors of BarCampBlock as well. I was pretty active in talking to a few people internally to help get us to sponsor though I know we've done it for other BarCamps before so it wasn't difficult at all. People all thought it was a good idea.

Personally, I think these kinds of events are where a lot of the interesting ideas people have in their heads around the web, open source, and communication percolate out. I hope to see at least a few members of the Mozilla community there. I've heard that the event is expecting at least 400 people and that it may go as high as 800. Not bad for a very loosely configured event on relatively short notice (at least for most of us).
