Woo Woo!! The new (and only modern) translation of Iamblichus' **On the
Mysteries** just showed up. This was done by John Dillon, Emma Clarke
and others. The only translation previously available in this century
was from the turn of the century (the Wilde translation) and the next
one from 100 years before that. Both were less than ideal. This edition
even has the critical edition of the Greek text on the facing pages.
**WOW!!!**
