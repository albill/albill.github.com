> The eight root downfall is to regard our physical bodies, or the
> skandhas or aggregates of our psycho-physical makeup, as impure and
> base. The reason why this is a root downfall is because Vajrayana sees
> everything as sacred. All appearances is a form of divinity, all sound
> is the sound of mantra, and all thought and awareness is the divine
> play of the transcending awareness, the Mahamudra experience. The
> potential for that sacredness exists within our present framework, so
> to speak, of the five skandhas. Acknowledging psycho-physical
> aggregates of an individual as the potential of the Buddhas of the
> five families, or the five elements, or the five feminine aspects, and
> so forth, is to recognize that, in tantra, the potential for the
> transformation exists within our present situation. To disparage that
> potential as something useless or impure or unwholesome is a root
> downfall, a basic contradiction, from the point of view of tantric
> practice.
