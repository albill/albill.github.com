I've uploaded the last part of my three part interview with <a href="http://www.thorncoyle.com/">T. Thorn Coyle</a> to the <a href="http://www.extemplo.org">Ex Templo</a> site.  You can go directly to the entry on the <a href="http://www.extemplo.org/?p=12">Ex Templo Blog</a>.

<a href="http://egina2.blogspot.com/">Father Jordan Stratford</a> and I have been talking recently and we'll be doing an interview in the near term. Father Stratford is a Gnostic priest in the  <a href="http://www.johannite.org/">Apostolic Johannite Church</a> in Victoria, British Columbia.

There is also a fair chance that I'll be able to interview a local activist Roman Catholic priest that Thorn knows but I have to track the fellow down and chat with him first so we'll see.
