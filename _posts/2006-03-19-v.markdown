The missus and I just got back from a late screening of <strong>V for Vendetta</strong>. I must say that I was quite impressed and happy with this version of one of my favorite comics. I'm not sure where Alan Moore's recent wanking about the film comes from (not about DC Comics but his opinion of the film itself). It seemed relatively faithful and some of my favorite scenes were almost 100% faithful to the original. Given the current political climate, the film is all the more appropriate. In fact, it reminded me of my own anger towards the powers that be, both now and in the longterm, for the lies and the way people's lives are fucked over soely for the sake of power. Go see it.
