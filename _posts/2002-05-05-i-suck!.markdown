So, I was supposed to go to the Shitro empowerment with but I had a sudden attack of lameness and got up waaay to late to make it there. I got this wonderful e-mail from her a short while ago telling me how cool it was. Joy. I suck. I'm planning on attending the Hevajra Initiation there later in the month. I wish there was more of a central clearinghouse of Tantric Buddhist stuff in the Pacific Northwest available. I know there is a bunch of stuff going on that I have no way of finding out about except accidentally, like the class list I posted a couple of weeks ago. I found that through Google but if you went to the group's own homepage, there was no link to their calendar anywhere on their site. You never would know. I'm on an e-mail list with people who are mostly on the East Coast and they are constantly posting about this or that retreat or teaching or empowerment that all seem to be occuring within a reasonable drive of them. I don't know if there is a lot more action on the East Coast than the West Coast (outside of California) or what... I find myself drawn, for some reason, to learning more about the Phurba and assciated deities and practices. I know of no one around here working with that specifically but I'm keeping my eyes open. I'm open to comments and thoughts here. I'm also doing some reading on the Medicine Buddha as well. I just picked up Peter Fenton's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0835607763/">Tibetan Healing: The Modern Legacy of the Medicine Buddha</a> and have been reading it. Today is R's birthday so a bunch of us are getting together after nine at the Barca (I believe) to celebrate with drinks and other chemically induced happiness. She and I have been speaking more about renting a house together. We'll see how it goes.
