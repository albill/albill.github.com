Last September, [I
blogged](http://www.openbuddha.com/2010/09/11/sometimes-mindfulness-requires-a-post-it-note/)
about the tattoo work I was having done on my left arm by a friend. I
had Buddhist refuge vows done in Sanskrit using the script commonly
called "Siddham" here in the West. You see this a lot for mantras and
other Sanskrit text in Japan and Korea (and I presume China, at least at
some point). The vows go:

> बुद्धं शरणं गच्छामि। धम्मं शरणं गच्छामि। संघं शरणं गच्छामि। Buddhaṃ
> śaraṇaṃ gacchāmi. Dharmaṃ śaraṇaṃ gacchāmi. Saṃghaṃ śaraṇaṃ gacchāmi.
> I take refuge in the Buddha. I take refuge in the Dharma. I take
> refuge in the Sangha.

I've posted preliminary pictures before of what it looked like after the
initial blackwork was done but not of the final design where it was
outlined in red. We actually went over both the black and the red
**twice** because I have a perfectionist tattoo artist and he wanted
everything to look clean and strong (as did I). This is what it
initially looked like before the red work the day it was done before it
healed:

When I was outside to work out the other day, I noticed that the light
was decent so I grabbed a couple of shots with my iPhone and I thought
that I'd share them. (Ignore the fact that I'm still growing some of the
shaved hair back on my freckled arm...)

*Outside of Arm*

As you can see, most of the characters repeat because, if you look at
the text I posted above, two of the three words are the same in all
instances. All in all, I think that is worked out very well and I get a
lot of random comments from people I meet about the work. I take them as
a reminder of my vows and my path as a Buddhist, engraved on my flesh.
