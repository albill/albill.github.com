I have no funny positive things to say here. Regardless of justification or opinions of it, war leads to the suffering of innocents. Who pays the price for these wars with their blood? The generals and "leaders" who declare them? No. The blood comes from the people who live with their families in the cities and from the individuals who, for whatever reason, choose to fight as soldiers. The suffering of soldiers is regrettable but they volunteered. The suffering of the poor people surrounded by the war is, to me, the real problem. These people didn't ask to get fucked by history and it's always the same story. Fuck you, Bush and Saddam, and fuck all of your minions that make this war part of their personal advancement to power.
