The other thing that we did this week was go see 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Einstuerzende Neubauten</span> this week for R's birthday. I'd never seen them in concert before but R has been a big fan for quite a while and it was a chance to get out. The show was at The Showbox in downtown Seattle. That place is a fairly good-sized club. I realized that I had been in it once back in 2000 for a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Legendary Pink Dots</span> show (which I did not like) with Redegg and other housemembers of the time. The show was fairly long and seemed to alternate pretty heavily between songs that I found more interesting and more...<span style="font-style: italic;">odd</span>...pieces. I'm told that it was typical in that regard. I do wonder how a band with a cult only following (there were probably 300 people there) survives year after year sometimes but I suppose it is an interesting life. R and I went to Dick's Drive-In afterwards and bought some much needed greasy burgers.
