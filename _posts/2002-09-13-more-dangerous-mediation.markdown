<strong>Caveat:</strong> I haven't listened to this yet, I just found it... From <a href="http://cbc.ca/tapestry/archives/2001/061701.html">http://cbc.ca/tapestry/archives/2001/061701.html</a>.

<strong>Meditation For Dummies</strong>

It seems like it should be the easiest thing in the world. You sit. And you think of ... nothing.. And then you sit some more. And try to think of nothing. That's meditation.

But anyone who's tried meditating knows it's far from simple, which is why there are so many workshops, books and tapes on meditation. Vancouver freelance journalist Lisa Christiansen has been wading through all the paraphernalia. And she kept a journal for Tapestry ­ a personal record of her journey to ‘inner space.’ She calls it ‘meditation for dummies.’

Produced by Kathleen Flaherty in Vancouver.

Can there be such a thing as too much contemplation?

A study of Buddhist meditators in the United States suggests there are limits to wholesome activities such as meditation practice. In the extreme, long periods of intense meditation can bring about unpleasant changes of mind ­ especially in ‘emotionally fragile Western students,’ the study says.

The author of the report is clinical psychologist Dr. Lois Vanderkooi. She is a clinical psychologist and the author of a research study on the pathology of meditation practice. She’s on staff at the State Mental Hospital in Boulder County, Colorado.
