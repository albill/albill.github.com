<strong>Bruce Sterling</strong>
<em>Graduate Studies Lecture Series</em>

Timken Lecture Hall, San Francisco campus

Bruce Sterling is the legendary master of the cyberpunk science fiction genre and a founder of the Viridian Design movement, which explores radical green technologies to deal with impending ecological collapse.

Sterling has written, "Don't become a well-rounded person. Well-rounded people are smooth and dull. Become a thoroughly spiky person. Grow spikes from every angle. Stick in their throats like a puffer fishâ€¦ . Learn about the stuff that was buried because it was too experimental or embarrassing or inexplicable."

In 2005 he was "visionary in residence" at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. He is a professor at the European Graduate School, Saas-Fee, Switzerland.
