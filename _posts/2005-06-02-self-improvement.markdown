I use an RSS reader and actually read a shitload of blogs (yes, that's a
technical term, like fuckwad). Most of the blogs fall into four
categories:

-   Cool Tech or IT stuff (I am a geek and I do work for Microsoft)
-   Sociological or Cultural studies and issues (lots of commentary on
    society, culture, brain development, etc)
-   Science Fiction authors and reviewers
-   Spirituality oriented Blogs

In the last category, I'm all over the map from reading pagan ones, a
few Christian ones, Integral oriented ones to Buddhist blogs.

This came from one this morning and I appreciated it a bit:

>
> Many who read this blog and others like it are dedicated to
> self-improvement. Dedication to self-improvement is an interesting
> phenomena; it can be a subtle form of self-criticism disguised by
> noble intentions, of never being good enough yet.

> Zen teachers have long said that the right intention for meditation is
> not meditation in order to gain peace and joy. As long as we believe
> our true nature is otherwise, we will never attain it. The paradox of
> zen style "self-improvement" is that we can only gain deeper
> experiences of peace and joy to the extent that we realize the peace
> and joy we already are.
>
> We don't meditate to be enlightened; we meditate because we're
> enlightened. The aim of practice - whatever form that takes - is to
> become more of who we already are, not to become someone or something
> else.
