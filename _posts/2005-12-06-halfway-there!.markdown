I just turned in my final paper for my "Para-Rational Perspectives" class in my program. With this paper and term over, I have completed 15 semester credits towards my Master's degree. My program is a 30 credit program with six of them being done via my thesis. This means that I'm mostly done with my course work (only three full classes left) and that I'm officially halfway through the program. I started it during this last January so I've effectively completed year one of two. I'm not likely to be done by this time next year but that is because I expect that it may take longer than three months to write my thesis. Even if I manage to do so in that sort of a period of time, I will have to have it go through the approval process to be accepted.
