<h2>A Latin Hymn to the Creator Ascribed to Plato</h2>
<h3>From the <em>Anthologia Latina</em></h3>
Hans Lewy of Chaldean Oracles fame has an article from 1946 on a hymn preserved in the <strong>Anthologia Latina</strong> that is ascribed to Plato. While Lewy felt that this origin was unlikely, it is clearly a hymn deriving from Platonic doctrines. I reproduce it below in both Latin and English.

Omnipotens, annosa poli quem suscipit aetas,
Quem sub millenis semper virtutibus unum
Nec numero quisquam poterit pensare nec aevo,
Nunc esto affatus, si quo to nomine dignum est,
Quo, sacer, ignoto gaudes, quod maxima tellus
Intremit et sistunt rapidos vaga sidera cursus.

Tu solus, to multus item, to primus et idem
Postremus mediusque simul mundique superstes.

Nam sine fine tui labentia tempora finis,
Altus ab aeterno spectans fera turbine certo
Rerum fata rapi vitasque involvier aevo
Atque iterum reduces supera in convexa referri,
Scilicet ut mundo redeat, quod partibus (h)austum
Perdiderit, refluumque iterum per corpora fiat.

Tu (siquidem fas est in temet tendere sensum
Et speciem temptare sacram, qua sidera cingis
Immensus longamque simul complecteris aethram
Fulmineis forsan rapida sub imagine membris)
Flammifluum quoddam iubar es, quo cuncta coruscans
Ipse vides nostrumque premis solemque diemque.

Tu genus omne deum, tu rerum causa vigorque,
Tu natura omnis, deus innumerabilis unus,
Tu sexu plenus toto, tibi nascitur olim
Hic deus, hic mundus, domus hic hominumque deumque,
Lucens, augusto stellatus flore iuventae.

Quem (precor, aspires), qua sit ratione creatus,
Quo genitus factusve modo, da nosse volenti.

Da, pater, augustas ut possim noscere causas,
Mundanas olim moles quo foedere rerum
Sustuleris animamque levi quo maximus olim
Texueris numero, quo congrege dissimilique,
Quidque id sit vegetum, quod per cita corpora vivit.

"Almighty, borne by age-old heavens, amid Thy myriad virtues
Thou art ever One, and no one can measure Thee with number or with time.

Now (if by any name it is meet to invoke Thee) Thou shalt be invoked by the
unknown name in which Thou, the Holy One, dost rejoice, whereat the mighty earth
trembles, and the wandering stars stand in their swift course.

Thou art One and likewise Many, Thou art First and Last, Thou art at once the
Center and the Survivor of the universe.

For Thou art without end, yet Thou bringest an end to the swift passage of
time, and on high, from eternity, Thou dost behold harsh fate swept on with
immutable whirl, Thou dost behold lives enclosed in time and again led back and
returned to the upper spheres so that the vitality, exhausted by births,' which
the universe has lost may return to it and may again circulate through the
(celestial) bodies.

If indeed we may turn our mind to Thee to assay Thy holy form wherewith Thou,
the Immeasurable, dost gird the stars and dost embrace all at once the vast
ether, with limbs, perchance, swift as the flash of lightning Thou art as it
were a fiery radiance, by whose blaze Thou dost see all and dost rule our sun
and day.

Thou art the whole race of gods, Thou the cause and strength of all things,
Thou art all nature, one god innumerable, in Thee are both male and female, to
Thee was once born this god, this universe, the home of both men and gods,
gleaming and sparkling with the sublime flower of youth.

Breathe Thy favor on my
prayer, and grant me to know how this universe was created, how born or made.

Grant, O Father, that I may know the sublime causes, by what bond Thou hast
sustained the cosmic mass, with what insubstantial numbers, even and odd, Thou
hast, in Thy greatness, woven the Soul, and what vigorous force lives in the
Swift Bodies."
