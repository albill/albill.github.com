I've been thinking about career and jobs off on on as all of you know if you've paid attention at all over the last six months.

I volunteered to help the people that are doing the Rites of Eleusis by revamping their website from scratch. We'll have to work out the details but I expect that will happen. Other than my own sites (<a href="http://www.hermetic.com">http://www.hermetic.com</a>, <a href="http://www.ogdoadic.com">http://www.ogdoadic.com</a>, <a href="http://www.zhangzhung.net">http://www.zhangzhung.net</a>), I seem to be acquiring volunteer sites in the last year.

This will take that up to five and I feel like I'm forgetting another one that I've spoken to someone somewhere about.

I've been wondering lately if there are smaller (but not tiny) non-profit organizations out there that don't have a full time web tech or IT guy but do have a decent sized website or a desire for one. I'm thinking of the kind of non-profits that have a paid office administrator and maybe a few other people but aren't the size of a small company. I know that many larger non-profits have a working relationship with a Seattle consulting company that provides them on-call services for a pretty high hourly rate on demand.

My idea is that there are probably some non-profits with money but not so much money that they want to pay a full time web guy. They have specific needs on a regular basis but not enough to shell out a couple of grand a month (at least) for someone. I'm wondering if money couldn't be made by offering services to such company for $250 to $300 a month. In return, they contract someone (like me!) to provide an average of no more than 10 hours a month of work on their websites and similar services. By "average" I mean that some months might require 15 hours and some might only require five but it averages out and that is the expectation. This breaks down to roughly $25 to $30 an hour for services, which is the going rate or a bit cheaper for web work and the like.

This kind of job wouldn't pay as much as my current work but if this kind of thing could hook up 10 or more organizations on a regular basis (preferably 15 or so), it would work out to be about 40 hours a week but it would be variable work and I could do it from home.

The real challenge in this would be finding clients who could pay for this and wanted it and to keep enough of them on a regular basis that money would come in reliably...
