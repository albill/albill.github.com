I stopped by Third Place Books near my home on the way back from seeing
the Aged Elders today. I picked up a couple of things:

-   **[At the Mountains of Madness: The Definitive
    Edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812974417/)** - This is
    the new edition of ATMoM by H.P. Lovecraft with an introduction by
    China Mieville. It also includes an additional essay by Lovecraft
    and the text of the story is supposed to be restored to it full
    version. Since I don't have a current copy of this anyway, it seemed
    like a good idea.
-   **[The Yoga of Delight, Wonder, and
    Astonishment](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0791410749/)** - This
    is a translation of the Vijnana-bhairava with notes and
    introduction. This text is an important Hindu tantric text oriented
    at the practitioner (and it was used and cheap too, not the $50 that
    Amazon lists it at..).
-   **[Kundalini Tantra](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8185787158/)**
    - This is part of a series by Swami Satyananda Saraswati. This text
    focuses on Kriya yoga and looks fairly detailed. I have been
    impressed by his other work. I had found his **[Asana Pranayama
    Mudra Bandha](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8186336141/)** a
    couple of weeks ago which was impressive in its completeness.

R and I are currently planning on doing yoga together as part of a joint
practice. She's done quite a bit of yoga at various points. I have not
but I have been meaning to for a long time. Quite a while ago, we took a
Kriya yoga class together but wound up doing much with it (this is
before we lived together).
