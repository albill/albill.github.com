Lovecraft with an introduction by China Mieville. It also includes an additional essay by Lovecraft and the text of the story is supposed to be restored to it full version. Since I don't have a current copy of this anyway, it seemed like a good idea.

She's done quite a bit of yoga at various points. I have not but I have been meaning to for a long time. Quite a while ago, we took a Kriya yoga class together but wound up doing much with it (this is before we lived together).
