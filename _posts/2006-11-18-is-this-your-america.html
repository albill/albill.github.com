Hopefully, you've already heard about this. If not, read the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-taser18nov18,0,4080498.story?coll=la-home-headlines">LA Times</a> here and <a href="http://www.blakeross.com/2006/11/17/on-the-ucla-tasering/">Blake Ross</a> writing on this.

This makes me actively sick. Leaving aside cops tasering someone for no good reason, refusing to provide identification to onlookers and then threatening onlookers, I'm utterly shocked that people just stood around like sheep and watched it happen. A couple of generations ago, bricks and bats would have been found and people would have taken steps to stop such an obvious abuse of power. I am against violence but I am also against people just standing by and watching college cops taser someone repeatedly as they yell at him to "stand up!"
