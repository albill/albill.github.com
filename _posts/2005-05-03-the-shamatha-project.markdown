The term "Shamatha" refers to an array of Buddhist meditative practices designed to develop advanced states of sustained, focused attention. The Shamatha Project entails a one-year residential retreat for 30 meditators, who will practice Shamatha 8-10 hours each day. We are tentatively planning to begin this retreat in September 2006. Rigorous scientific studies will be conducted before, during, and after this retreat to measure the physiological and psychological changes that occur as a result of this attentional training.

The research team includes experts in the cognitive and neuroscientific study of attention, visualization, cognitive control, and sensori-motor processing; emotion and mental health; compassionate, prosocial behavior; longitudinal statistical analyses; and Buddhism. Several of the investigators are skilled in the use of modern, noninvasive neuro-imaging techniques; most have been engaged for years in conferences, seminars, and work groups related to establishing conceptual and methodological connections between Buddhist practice, psychological science, and neuroscience. The research project will be coordinated by the Center for Mind and Brain at the University of California, Davis, headed by Dr. George R. Mangun, an international leader in the cognitive neuroscience of attention. I am organizing the meditation training. According to the Buddhist tradition, the achievement of Shamatha involves a state of sustained, voluntary attention, characterized by exceptional stability and vividness, which can be sustained effortlessly for at least four hours. The proposed project will involve assessment of both cognitive and socio-emotional variables at several points in time across the one-year study.

Our brain-imaging and behavioral findings should be useful for treating people with a variety of cognitive and emotional disorders, such as ADHD, anxiety, depression, excessive anger, and insomnia. All of these mental problems are closely related to the ability to control attention and regulate emotion. We expect that relatively soon after the Shamatha training begins, measurable changes will occur in these abilities, suggesting that certain aspects of the training could be relatively easily incorporated into daily life situations for persons outside a retreat setting. For the proposed study, participants will reside in a contemplative research facility, optimally suited for scientific and contemplative research, over a twelve-month period. I will serve as their resident instructor, providing them with ongoing instruction and guidance in meditation training. The 12-month training program will emphasize:

The team of investigators has met numerous times over the past two years to develop ideas for the design, measures, and statistical analyses. We are currently in search of a suitable contemplative training facility within the continental United States, and we are seeking funds for conducting the scientific research. We are still accepting applicants to participate in this year-long retreat. It is my hope that we will be able to select the most suitable participants who would most benefit from this training, regardless of their financial resources. With this motivation, we are soliciting donations to provide full and partial scholarships for worthy applicants. I would also like to organize a 3-month Shamatha retreat-a kind of pilot study-prior to the year-long Shamatha Project, but this will depend on our locating a suitable retreat facility.
