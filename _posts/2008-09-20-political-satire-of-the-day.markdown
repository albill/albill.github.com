I haven't blogged much this last week as I've been reading and engaging in other activities. I do offer this satire of the moment, which I find rather humorous. I actually don't know who the artist is that drew it. I suspect that my left of center politics are not a deep mystery to anyone who reads my blog.

Thanks to Rubylou for turning me on to the image. See you at the November elections!
