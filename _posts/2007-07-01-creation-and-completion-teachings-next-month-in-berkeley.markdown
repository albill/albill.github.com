There will be a two and a half day long class on Creation and Completion stage practice next month in Berkeley at the local Shambhala center. I'm considering attending this as it could be very informative. <h2>

This book provides detailed treatments of visualization and of integrating the experience of visualization. The text itself is quite extraordinary and the translation makes it elegantly accessible. It will be very beneficial to participants to have read the (brief) book in advance so they can better appreciate Rinpoche's guidance to its meaning. Khandro Rinpoche has taught in the Shambhala mandala since 1994. She is well known for her remarkable clarity in teaching and inspiring students to practice and study with good intention. She is a student of her father, HH Mindrolling Trichen, the current head of the Nyingma lineage, and also trained with HH Karmapa XVI and Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. In 2003, Shambhala Publications released her book, This Precious Life.
