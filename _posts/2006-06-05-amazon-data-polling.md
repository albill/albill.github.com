Does anyone have a clue how to use Amazon's APIs to pull your purchasing data? For <a href="http://www.librarything.com">LibraryThing</a>, I want to pull pages with the ISBN numbers of books that I have purchased.

If you look at your account on Amazon, you can look at your entire purchase history <strong>but</strong> it shows them to you by book order with only the title showing and with only a couple of orders per page. I have a purchase history going back to 1998. If I could pull the ISBN data for that, I would have a fair chunk of my library over the last eight years.

I also want to use it for the program "<a href="http://books.aetherial.net/wordpress/">Books for OS X</a>", which is an OS X book cataloging program. It can talk to LibraryThing as well.

I'm stumped at how to pull the data though.
