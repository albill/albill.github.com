So, I watched the new trailer for the Denzel Washington 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <b>Man on Fire</b> movie the other day. They play a Nine Inch Nails song in both of the trailers that I've seen. I recognize the song but <i><b>I can't figure out what song it is!!!</b></i>Â  This is bugging me to no end.
