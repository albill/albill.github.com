R just left on the plane today to go visit family and friends in the Bay Area. One of her childhood friends is getting married so she took off to attend.

Lat night we watched <strong><a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0243876/">The Duel</a></strong>, which we had rented a year or two ago. It's a rather lighthearted Kung Fu picture about a duel between to sword saints. The whole thing is rather slapstick in many places with a definite "James Bond" theme going (with even the music at one point) with Dragon 9, an imperial agent and friend of one of the saints. He also happens to be relatively vulgar and I'm sure if I wanted to learn some new Chinese words, I could do so from this film. R seems rather partial to this film as well and it is one of the few that she's expressed interest in having on DVD. Usually, we stick to more dramatic movies from China (when doing Chinese) such as <strong><a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0162866/"> The Emperor and the Assassin</a></strong>, which we own and which I highly recommend.

I had to take R to the airport after lunch so I came home afterwards to work on the annual reviews for members of my team in my effort to finish. On the way, I stopped by my friend Aron's comic book store, <strong>The Dreaming</strong>, in the
University District to a brief run (I know more than one Aron for those checking...). While there, of course, I wound up spending a bunch. It turns out that he'd gotten in the Alan Moore CDs that I'd been looking for so I now have a copy of <strong><a href="http://www.atelier.abelgratis.co.uk/snakes1.html">Snakes and Ladders</a></strong> and <strong> <a href="http://www.atelier.abelgratis.co.uk/angel1.html">Angel Passage</a></strong> that I didn't have before. He wound up giving me one as a belated birthday gift because he hadn't been able to make it to the birthday party last week. That was unexpected and rather sweet. While there, I also picked up the first issue of the new Grant Morrison comic<strong> We3</strong> and the latest issue of Warren Ellison's <strong>Planetary</strong> and his prequel volume for <strong>Transmetropolitan</strong>, which is a collection of excerpts from Spider Jerusalem's <strong>I Hate It Here</strong> column from the comic. Cute and well illustrated.

After working into the evening, I watched a couple of things on TV and looked at some <strong>Dark Angel</strong>, which I have recently gotten access to the first season of...

I should also mention that earlier in the week, R and I had dinner with Brandy and Ted at <strong>Galleria's</strong> on Capitol Hill. I forget how excellent the food is there. Definitely upscale Mexican food. This is not <strong>Taco Del Mar</strong> or even <strong>Bimbo's Bitchin' Burritos</strong>. It was nice to have dinner with Brandy and Ted and it was something that we'd been trying to do for, I dunno, nine months or something. My next goal is to try to actually have that dinner over at Rachael, Jane and Sean's place that Rachael and I have been talking about forever.

I'd say this weekend would be relaxing, if lonely, except this is my Saturday to visit the Prison. I will do my best to gain further experience points enlightening the inmates with the joys of the Goddess which can only be expressed through the sound of my voice. Hopefully, I make my save versus shiv as well.

That's it for me. I'm out.
