If I wasn't planning on being at Disnelyland this Saturday, I'd be going to <a href="http://www.bavc.org/true2life">Tru2Life</a>.

It describes itself as follows:
<blockquote><strong>Why True2Life?</strong> True2Life is a unique gathering of industry and government leaders, educators, community service providers and young people. This one-day, special event has been crafted to showcase youth as cultural producers and the Bay Area as a model in linking youth to community and industry change.

<strong>Who's coming?</strong> Digital industry gurus, educators, government, youth, community organizations, artists, animation pioneers, musicians, funders, and futurists. Be part of the discussionâ€”the entire day will be documented by youth production crews and podcasted to 24 million viewers by PodShow!</blockquote>
I'm especially interested in the results of the <strong>Shakeup in Cyberspace</strong> panel. I'll be watching the recorded version when it is available.

The event is run by the <a href="http://www.bavc.org/">Bay Area Visual Coalition</a> (BAVC). I'm familiar with them through classes and other training that they offer. They did a presentation at my work on classes that we could take (state funded!) through them. I've been looking at some video production and Flash development classes.
