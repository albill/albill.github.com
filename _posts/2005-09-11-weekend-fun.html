<p>It's been a relatively busy weekend. On Friday, I ran off during lunch and  turned in my first paper for the term. One down, three to go, at least for that  class. I'm still working my way through Edmund Burke but I have to finish it  very soon.</p> <p>In the evening, Madeline came over relatively late. We stayed up late playing  a cranium card game and the watching <strong>Big Trouble in Little China</strong> because  she'd never seen it. Kids these days.</p> <p>Saturday, after breakfast and dropping her off, was a bit of studying and  other work about the house. R and I did go out for the late evening though. We  met a bunch of our friends at <a href="http://www.clubnocnoc.com/crucifixion.html">Club Noc Noc</a> downtown.  Saturday night has been their Industrial/Goth night for a while though I'm told  that their remodel is recent. We hung out until a bit after midnight. We met  Thomas and Allison, who were acquaintances of a friend of ours. They were  introduced to me as 'Al.' I got to have one of those &quot;Oh, you're Al BILLINGS!&quot;  moments a short while later. It turns out that they are on the local e-mail list  for the Church of Mez and have seen me post there before. Allison runs <a href="http://www.velvetgarden.com/">http://www.velvetgarden.com</a>, as it  turns out as well (in fact, that's her on the front page now that I look at  it...). They moved up here from San Francisco after living there for a few  years. </p> <p>R loves it when people recognize me in public. It's usually because of my  website. I keep telling her that I'm famous but she doesn't seem to be buying  it.</p> <p>I did get one real surprise of the evening when Harold McNeil walked in...  For those that haven't known Harold forever, he is a once-local artist who does  a lot of &quot;dark&quot; artwork via mostly pen and pencil. He used to have work up  around a bunch of places in town. He moved to Portland a few years back and he  mentioned to me that he'd been living abroad for a year (I believe, the club was  loud). He's back in town now though.</p>
