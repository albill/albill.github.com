Well, shee-it, John and I just spoke on the phone. He's on his way to Bellingham (city to the North near border) to visit his family. I thought he wasn't leaving town. When he comes back, he's going to be picking up C at the airport tomorrow so I'm sure they'll be spending time together... So, it's Christmas Eve and I'm alone at home with the furry animals. As long as I can avoid seeing "It's a wonderful life" on TV, I'll be fine and won't be forced to kill myself or others. ;-) It seems they are showing the first half of season 4 of Farscape on Sci-Fi today. It's too bad that I didn't know or I would have taped it because Rebecca and I haven't seen it. I have it all as DivX files but that isn't the same as watching it on the tube. I wonder if my bank is still open. I have a check (for clothes for Madeline) from my dad and a check from the <a href="http://www.cabiri.org">Cabiri</a> for the show that I was stage crew on for Microsoft. On a positive note, my boss gave me a gift certificate at work for $15 at Amazon (he's a nice guy that way) and I ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060280921/"><em>Wielding Power - The Essence of Ritual Practice</em></a> from them. Someone (Greg?) recommended it to me. They notified me early this morning that it had been delayed but would ship anytime and then it came in today's mail... it seems there system might have been backlogged. It looks like an interesting text, definitely not a novice one and I think I'll get something out of reading it. I've been cleaning today, going through the mounds of paper and trash from presents and from my computer area. As most who know me personally know, why I'm not necessarily slovenly in personal hygiene (except that I don't like to shave), I tend to be rather bad about my personal space. Not the food-rotting kind of bad but the giant mounds of books and papers and CDs around my chairs and piling on horizontal surfaces kind of bad. I'm just rather chaotic in my organization. R commented on the sty-like nature of the computer area and the house in general before she left town so I've been making a point to fix it up a bit and clean up the random crap. I've found some of my missing Aurum Solis related books. If I have the energy, I'm going to start a new notebook today and start going through some of the more obscure stuff. I still have a last Archon ritual to finish as well.
