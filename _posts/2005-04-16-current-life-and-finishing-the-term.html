<p>I haven&#39;t been reading a lot of weblogs for the last week nor have I really 
been posting. If your life has been interesting but I haven&#39;t commented as 
someone who reads your blog, it is probably because I haven&#39;t read it.</p>
<p>I heard from R that Ple had given birth this last week. I still haven&#39;t read 
it myself on her blog. Yet another ex reproducing. The world seems full of 
babies these days. At least three ex&#39;s of mine have had kids in the last couple 
of years. Who is next? :-)</p>
<p>The main reason that I haven&#39;t written much is that my trimester ends next 
Friday, 4/22. My last papers for each class are both due that day. In order to 
avoid a logjam, I&#39;ve been working to get my history one done this week. I have 
now done this. R just proofed it for me (thanks!) and I cleaned it up based on 
her remarks and some overall edits that I saw that needed to be done as I went 
through it again. I&#39;ve mailed this off to my prof now. This leaves my philosophy 
paper, which I still need to finish my reading for. That paper is much shorter 
though. For the history paper, I had to read a historical book chosen by me so 
that took a little longer. I expect that tomorrow will be devoured by text 
reading for the current paper.</p>
<p>I&#39;m hoping to get the paper done before Friday but I may wind up working to 
the deadline. We&#39;ll see. I haven&#39;t even done any of my reading for pleasure much 
these last few weeks. I have a copy of <b>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/057507325X/">Woken Furies</a></b> 
by Richard Morgan waiting for me or a copy of <b>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0345466357/">The Coyote 
Kings of the Space-Age Bachelor Pad</a></b>. <b>Woken Furies</b> will probably 
be the winner in that battle for attention. I also have a library copy of<b>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0415933196/qid=1113714524/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-5812800-5064112?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">
Shadow Cities: A Billion Squatters, A New Urban World</a></b> waiting as well.</p>
<p>Next month, I&#39;ll be taking my graduate Religion class and the introductory 
graduate Literature class. We&#39;ll see if they are easier but given the topic 
matters, I expect that the first one won&#39;t be too difficult for me.</p>
