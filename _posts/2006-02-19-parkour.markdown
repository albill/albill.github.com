There was some discussion on an e-mail list that I'm on about
**Parkour** the other day. This is the freestyle street running and
climbing discipline that people may have heard about. I first heard
about it a year or two ago when Warren Ellis had a character doing it in
one of his **Global Frequency** comics (\#6, I believe) in order to get
across London quickly. I've been doing a little reading on it today and
watching some google videos and the best of these guys are quite
impressive. Think of Jackie Chan's antics of diving and leaping above
and through things done at a full run on rooftops and the sides of
builds or other structures. A few links:

    *David seems to be one of the hot practitioners in the UK and has
    been in BBC and other videos doing his thing.*

    (*looks like it is from Banlieue 13*)

Interesting stuff though you obviously need to be in incredible shape to
do this. Some of the moves I've seen in the videos might get stupid
people killed too.
