I went to the launch event for Neal Stephenson's new novel,
**[Anathem](http://www.amazon.com/Anathem-Neal-Stephenson/dp/0061474096/)**,
this evening in San Francisco. It was hosted by the [Long Now
Foundation](http://www.longnow.org) and streamed live to the world. (My
review of **Anathem** is
[here](http://www.arcanology.com/2008/08/21/neal-stephensons-anathem-reviewed/).)

Neal Stephenson During the event, Neal Stephenson read briefly from the
opening section of the novel, explaining terms in brief. Following this,
there was singing orchestrated by [David
Stutz](http://synthesist.net/music/anathem/), who is a friend of
Stephenson's and a musicologist. As I have [mentioned
previously](http://www.arcanology.com/2008/06/24/anathem-and-music/), he
has composed and performed vocal music set in the world of **Anathem**.
He had brought with him the other individuals that have performed this
music for the CD that Stutz produced. This CD was available at the event
in its final form and the group sang portions of it as the interlude
between other events of the evening. They also performed some music, a
[lament](http://monastic.org/orth/lament.html), that was not included on
the CD but which Stutz has discussed on his website.

David Stutz and Choir Following the initial music, Stewart Brand, Neal
Stephenson, and Danny Hillis did a group discussion of the ideas in the
book and took written questions from the audience. As the thinking of
the Long Now Foundation for their 10,000 year clock played an
inspirational role in the novel, it made sense to have all three on
stage.

Stewart Brand, Neal Stephenson, and Danny Hillis After more music,
Stephenson did the required book signing and there was a brief
performance of the jokingly named "Shovelfu" with (you guessed it)
shovels. I don't want to give any spoilers to the book since I've
avoided them so far but this was a joking a reference to some actions in
the novel and a rather enthusiastically martial monastic. (Someone also
made a reference to the book being "Post-Aclockolyptic Fiction" as
well.)

David Stutz with his Tetrahedron The evening closed with David Stutz
giving instructions on the mathematical basis of the music he wrote and
with a hands on demonstration. First, he demonstrated the use of the
music as part of a Turing Machine (including a roll of paper that he was
holding). He then arranged for a crowd of people to handle small
tetrahedrons with instructions that were passed from person to person
with musical accompaniment. This was followed by a fuller demonstration
on the creation, musically, of cellular automata from simple rules with
the crowd clapping in rhythm.

Crowd Performing as Cellular Automata I'm absolutely entranced by the
work that Stutz has put into all of this and the obvious fun of it. He
has also made the musical scores for this work
[available](http://synthesist.net/music/2008/08/musical-scores-used-in-the-anathem-music-project/)
with a creative commons license, which is cool. I managed to meet up
with some of my acquaintances from
[Noisebridge](https://www.noisebridge.net/index.php/NoiseBridge), the
local hacker space-in-formation, so it was a pretty good evening
overall. **Update:** Video of Neal Stephenson's reading from the event
and of the singing of the lament can be watched at [fora.tv's
website](http://fora.tv/2008/09/09/Sci-Fi_Novelist_Neal_Stephenson_Reads_from_Anathem).
