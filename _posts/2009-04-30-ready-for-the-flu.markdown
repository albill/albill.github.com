Everyone is worked up about the new flu this week. I can't say that I've
been immune to this either. As sick as I've been in the last six months,
the prospect of another big disease coming around makes me worry about
the state of my immune system. That being said, people really do need to
calm down. Even if the worst case scenarios are true, turning to panic
isn't going to save anyone. Even at its worst, the Spanish Flu of 1918
was only caught by slightly more than a quarter of the population. Of
that group, the vast VAST majority survived it fine. While this flu
could be milder or could be worse, we definitely have developed better
medical techniques for dealing with epidemics during the last 90 years.
People should take wise precautions and be ready to treat people in
their families if they become sick and to stay home from work if
necessary. If we're lucky, this will die out on its own. More likely,
we'll have a nasty flu go around but it may not turn as fatal as it has
been in Mexico. If we have a lull until Fall, as happened in the Spanish
Flu, and a vaccine becomes available, I would urge people to consider
getting vaccinated when it is possible. I've only had the flu once in my
life so it is hard to know what to make of this personally. Vinay Gupta
has also suggested the [Flu Code](http://bit.ly/flucode) for at-risk
areas as a guideline for action: **Flu Code 0.1Beta English** - A Public
Service from The Institute for Collapsonomics. 1) If I have any signs of
possible flu infection I will stay at home. 2) I will stay away from
crowds whenever possible and always wear a mask while in public places.
3) I will cleanse my hands at the doorway when I arrive at my
destination. 4) I will encourage other people to follow these rules to
protect us all.
