<blockquote>"The only freedom which counts is the freedom do to what some other people think to be wrong.  There is no point in demanding freedom to do that which all will applaud.  All the so-called liberties or rights are things which have to be asserted against others who claim that if such a thing is to be allowed their own rights are infringed or their own liberties threatened.  This is always true, even when we speak of the freedom to worship, or the right of free speech or association, or of public assembly.  If we are to allow freedoms at all there will constantly be complaints that either the liberty itself or the way in which it is exercised is being abused, and, if it is a genuine freedom, these complaints will often be justified.  There is no way of having a free society in which there is not abuse.  Abuse is the very hallmark of liberty."</blockquote>
<strong>Hailsham</strong>, the former Lord Chief Justice of England
