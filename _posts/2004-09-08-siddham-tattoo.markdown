Some more possibilities for tattoo designs...I'm looking at Tantric
Buddhist influences at the moment with a focus on scripts and mantras.

This is Siddham script used in Japanese tantric Buddhism (Mikkyo) for
the display of Sanskrit characters in mantras, mandalas, inscriptions
and the like.

The ones below are, in descending order, the letters used for Air, Wind,
Fire, Water, and Earth. "Air" in this instance, unless I'm confused, is
"Space" or "Void" in other Asian schemes.
