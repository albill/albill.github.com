<p>Through the use of a friendly steroid topical and anti-histamines, my bee 
sting has gone from &quot;atrocious&quot; to only &quot;somewhat annoying.&quot; Someone remind me 
not to get stung for another 20+ years since I think my immune system is getting 
tweaked out over it. Still, I shouldn&#39;t complain too much. My ex-wife is 
allergic (having been stung over 100 times in a sibling incident) and could be 
killed by a sting. We used to wonder if Madeline, my daughter, was allergic too 
but she&#39;s been stung a few times and has been any worse off than most children.</p>
<p>The wedding is getting closer. It&#39;s just over a month and a half away and 
we&#39;re just getting the invitations out. That&#39;s likely to be my fault as much as 
anything as R has been doing most of the work there (and I really appreciate 
it!) but I&#39;ve been not focusing on it. My main task coming up is to get a draft 
of the ritual, itself, put together for R and I to review and for her to do her 
own edits on. Merging Buddhist, Thelemic, and Pagan sensibilities without 
arriving at a mishmash is a difficult task. I was looking at some of William 
Blake&#39;s poetry the other night for some possible verse (heh) but nothing showed 
up. I&#39;m open to suggestions from the peanut gallery.</p>
<p>My birthday is in two days. I&#39;ll be 33. I have fairly neutral feelings on 
this. On the one hand, I&#39;m getting older and I&#39;m not a lot closer to some of my 
personal goals. The last decade, while being a time of learning, maturing and 
career building, has also been one big distraction from where I&#39;d thought I&#39;d 
be. Getting divorced, living with Lesa, starting an order, merging that body 
into the Aurum Solis and then heading in that direction, meeting R and then 
moving in together to now where we&#39;re getting married. Along the way, I&#39;ve gone 
from an intellectual interest in Tibetan Buddhism to some level of actual 
practice. Life is always sloppy isn&#39;t it? :-)</p>
<p>On the other hand, I also figure that, if I take care of myself, my life is 
less than a half over, possibly even just a third. I&#39;ve got a lot of time left 
to do various things but I have to start planting and cultivating personal 
seeds. I have education goals that mesh with my personal goals and they aren&#39;t 
going to happen on their own. Of course, all of these things are <b><i>work</i></b> 
and it takes a lot of energy to work on anything after coming home from my work 
at the office. It would be far easier to do what so many do and watch some TV. 
The problem is, of course, then you realize that a year or three has gone by and 
your life is exactly the same as it was. Life is motion and it has to actually
<b><i>move</i></b> in order for it to matter. </p>
<p>R and I have spoken about creating a &quot;five year plan&quot; about where we want to 
be together in five years and working towards it. Some of that is about 
educational or other career goals and some is about things like buying retreat 
land or a place away from the city. There is also the real possibility of 
Madeline moving much further away as her mother graduates from college and takes 
a teaching position wherever one is offered. I like the idea of creating such a 
plan but it&#39;s a little scary too because if we do create one, then we have to 
try to stick to it, which is harder than just kind of drifting along. The price 
of doing something organized... </p>
<p>I&#39;m looking forward to having people over this week for my birthday though 
some frantic cleaning is going to involved in order to set the house in order 
for 20+ potential guests.</p>
