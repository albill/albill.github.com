<a href="https://www.noisebridge.net">Noisebridge</a> in San Francisco has been doing a regular event in the hackerspace of a night of five minute presentations called, "<a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Five_Minutes_of_Fame">Five Minutes of Fame</a>." For the last set, we actually recorded the presentations and have put them up on <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/noisebridge">Noisebridge Channel</a>. I encourage people to go take a look at them if they are interested in this sort of thing. You can see the Other Al doing his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHk47KYH064&feature=channel_page">presentation</a> on the use of Real Names below (unless you're reading this through a Planet, which nukes embedded video...): <lj-embed></lj-embed>
