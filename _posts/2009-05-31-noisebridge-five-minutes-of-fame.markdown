[Noisebridge](https://www.noisebridge.net) in San Francisco has been
doing a regular event in the hackerspace of a night of five minute
presentations called, "[Five Minutes of
Fame](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Five_Minutes_of_Fame)." For the
last set, we actually recorded the presentations and have put them up on
[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) on the [Noisebridge
Channel](http://www.youtube.com/noisebridge). I encourage people to go
take a look at them if they are interested in this sort of thing. You
