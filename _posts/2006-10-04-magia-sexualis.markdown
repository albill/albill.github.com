![image](http://www.zhangzhung.net/lj/magia-sexualis.jpg)Hugh Urban's
new book is finally out, [Magia Sexualis: Sex, Magic, and Liberation in
Modern Western
Esotericism](http://www.amazon.com/Magia-Sexualis-Liberation-Western-Esotericism/dp/0520247760).
This not a cheap book at all at $55 for the hardcover. Many people will
probably want to wait for the paperback edition in a year or three.
Urban is one of the better authors on topics to do with Hindu Tantra and
had an [interesting
article](http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/VolumeV/Unleashing_the_Beast.htm)
on Aleister Crowley back in 2003 that was published in Esoterica. I've
been looking forward to reading this new book but I doubt it will have
much to add to my thesis since I am focusing on the Golden Dawn so
closely, which had very little (if any) in the way of sexual magical
practices. The book appears to focus closely on the stream of such
practices coming out of the 19th century, which is considerable.
