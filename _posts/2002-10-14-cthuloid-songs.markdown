I found this recently, "[The Cthulhu
Hymnal](http://www.santafe.edu/~shalizi/cthulhu-hymnal.html)."

### Onward, Cthulhu Cultists

*By [Simon Barber](mailto:simon@brithund.demon.co.uk). To the tune of
\`\`Onward, Christian Soldiers'':* Onwards, Cthulhu Cultists, just a few
more years Waiting till the Stars Are Right, when he Reappears Rising
from the ocean, striding to the shore Claiming as his birthright, lands
he ruled before *CHORUS: Onwards Cthulhu Cultists, like in times before
Best get on his good side, or he'll eat us raw!* Great is Lord Cthulhu
--- this you ought to know To get in his good books, while he sleeps
below Imprisoned in Ry'leh, far beneath the waves Till we liberate him,
from his living grave *CHORUS* Think of divine splendour, shaped not
unlike Man But with beard of tentacles --- picture if you can! Splendid
wings of ebon hue, spread beneath the moon Sleeping down the aeons,
dreaming from his tomb *CHORUS* Once he ruled in majesty, in the days of
yore Earth was young and splendid, and His was the Law Till the jealous
Elder Gods, envying his skill Bound him with their symbols --- but we
serve him still! *CHORUS* Soon comes the Millennium, face it without
fear If you love Cthulhu, then your future's clear Ignore Nostrodamus,
skip the Rapture too Cthulhu is recruiting --- what he wants, is YOU!
*CHORUS*
