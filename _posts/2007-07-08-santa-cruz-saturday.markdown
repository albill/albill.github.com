suggested on Friday that we go have a "fun day" out this weekend. We
decided to go to Santa Cruz's boardwalk, which we had gone to a few
years ago, before we moved here. We drove down, got a pair of unlimited
ride passes, and spent a few hours wandering around with the rides and
eating bad food, like corndogs. All in all, it was a good way to spend
the afternoon. I put a [photo
set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157600708400286/) of
pictures up on Flickr but there is one notable picture from the Double
Shot ride. The Double Shot is one of those rides where they launch you
100+ feet straight up into the air in seats and then you fall straight
down. Needless to say, we did not eat first...
