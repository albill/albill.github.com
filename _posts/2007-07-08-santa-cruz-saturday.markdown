We decided to go to Santa Cruz's boardwalk, which we had gone to a few years ago, before we moved here. We drove down, got a pair of unlimited ride passes, and spent a few hours wandering around with the rides and eating bad food, like corndogs. All in all, it was a good way to spend the afternoon. I put a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157600708400286/">photo set</a> of pictures up on Flickr but there is one notable picture from the Double Shot ride. The Double Shot is one of those rides where they launch you 100+ feet straight up into the air in seats and then you fall straight down. Needless to say, we did not eat first...
