David Stutz has [a
post](http://synthesist.net/music/2008/08/mohr-mascheroni-math-in-the-music-of-anathem/)
on his music blog on the composition of the music for Neal Stephenson's
**Anathem** that he did. The music is not simply some nice names
appropriate for the novel attached to some music but an attempt to apply
mathematical principles to the creation of music in true super geek
fashion. In the post, he discusses the difficulties in turning the
Pythagorean Theorem into music and the solution that he found that maps
it (and other Euclidean constructs) into circles and points from their
intersections.

He also gives a sample from a 14 minute piece of the Pythagorean
Theorem, which was new to me since it wasn't on the early version of the
music that came with my advance readers copy of **Anathem**. Go to [his
post](http://synthesist.net/music/2008/08/mohr-mascheroni-math-in-the-music-of-anathem/)
in order to here it. I am looking forward to hearing more of this music
performed next week and getting a chance to pick up a copy of the CD.
