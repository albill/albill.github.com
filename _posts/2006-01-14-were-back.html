R and I flew back on Alaska Airlines this afternoon. We got home about 30  minutes ago. You know it is sad when the weather is better in January in Denver  than in Seattle. It's cold here.

We have a dinner engagement that R bought me as a Yule present this evening.  Other than that, I'll be around this weekend and back at my work on Monday. If I  have time, I'm going to get caught up on blogs and such but I want to do things  like put all of my handwritten notes (about 12 pages or so) of my father's  accounts, properties, creditors, etc. into a spreadsheet for tracking. I also  need to sit down and do some school reading since the term started on this last  Monday and I'm taking two classes.
