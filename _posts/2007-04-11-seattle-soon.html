Several readers of my blog have spoken at a couple of points about seeing me. This is your chance to speak up and work something out if you're around.  Aron, Dana, Catherine,  and Sean  have all said something about getting together.

Let's talk in e-mail or comments if you're interested.

Off to bed.
