The seller came back after we gave the list of about two and a half grand of repairs that were needed and said, basically, "I&apos;m not going to do them but I&apos;ll give you three grand off of the closing for you to do them." R and I decided that this is acceptable so we have moved to the next stage (somewhere after denial), which is our mortgage broker inspecting the property. It is thought to be unlikely that they&apos;ll flag the same problems that we did so, gods willing, we may be able to sign in a week or so and actually move in around 6/21...
