That's right. Even if the Dems don't get the senate, it looks like the fun parade is over. That's right, Red Party Whackos, you're out! <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/11/07/election.main/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/11/07/election.main/</a> Now, I'm not actually a Democrat. I actually have a healthy distaste but it definitely doesn't have the odor of utter ethical bankruptcy that the Republicans and their tin-horn dictator have... The Dems are like Scott to Dr. Evil -- only quasi-evil. I wouldn't trust them with my back turned and the lights down but then the Republicans will do it in daylight, slap "Enemy Combatant" on you, and send you to Gitmo. I'll take old school political corruption for ten, Jack. At least you can understand that.
