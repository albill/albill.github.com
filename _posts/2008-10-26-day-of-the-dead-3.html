I am feeling slightly better today so R and I decided to get out of the house for a while. In Fruitvale (part of Oakland) there is a <a href="http://www.unitycouncil.org/ddlm/index.htm">Day of the Dead festival</a>. This is a sort of streetfair with Day of the Dead altars, vendors, food, music, etc. We'd spoken about going earlier in the week so it seemed a good opportunity to do something.

It turned out to be bigger than we had expected and packed. We wandered around for a while and I picked up a couple of things to add to our own Day of the Dead altar. We usually buy one small thing every year (except the year when we were in Mexico where we bought a bunch of stuff). R picked up a new sugar skull to replace the rather tired one that we've had for a few years since we never eat them.

I took a few photos of some of the altars on display. The large one for Oakland deaths was more tragic than most.

This year, we only know one person who has died and we were not extremely close. In the last couple of years before that, R and I have both lost family members. I hope that the coming year is without loss but that is hardly a choice anyone gets to make.
