This was found <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/Print.aspx?Id=4e4d6d35-ef7f-4e42-808c-589ea4540202">here</a> this morning:
<blockquote>At least 800,000 books and manuscripts, including India's first political treaties the "Arthasastra" written in the 4th century BC by Kautilya, that are lying in Mysore University in Karnataka, will be digitised by Google, the world's leading Internet search engine.

"Written in both papers and palm leaves, there are around 100,000 manuscripts in our library, some dating back to the eighth century. The effort is to restore and preserve this cultural heritage for effective dissemination of knowledge," said J Shashidhara Prasad, vice chancellor of the university.

"Many manuscripts on ayurveda, mathematics, medicine, science, astrology and economy including 'Arthasastra' and several paper manuscripts of the Wodeyar dynasty of Mysore will be digitised first," Prasad, who was recently in Delhi, said.</blockquote>
This is interesting. I hope that Google continues to expand these efforts to many other languages outside of English.
