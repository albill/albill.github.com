<p>My dad and I spoke last week a couple of times. He's going to be staying at  our house next week for about a week (nicely coinciding with the end of my term,  of course). He'll be in our spare room downstairs. My dad has never stayed with  me before though my mother has (not that they have anything to do with one  another). It is a bit odd since in many ways, I'm not terribly close to my dad.  He is my dad and I did grow up around him but I didn't spend much time (read  none) with him during most of my teens until I was in college. </p> <p>From mid-1998 through the beginning of 2000, I rented a house from him with  Redegg, her husband, and another roommate (who is now her husband). That led to  more interaction but having your dad as a distant landlord (he was living in the  Rocky Mountain states) isn't always conducive to much real discussion.</p> <p>He and I do need to talk now since he is rather ill and it will be terminal  without some lucky breaks and surgery. I'm not looking forward to discussing his  will with him, his wishes if he's incapacitated, etc. but it needs to be done.  I'm sure he isn't looking forward to it either.</p> <p>Luckily, R and I had no real Thanksgiving plans this year. We normally do  something with Tylik and family but that isn't happening this year. This means  it is no big deal to stay home and do something small (or go out to dinner  someplace either). We're also going to do some photographic studio work with  him, me, R, Madeline and combinations thereof in order to get some nice pictures  done, especially for Madeline with her grandpa.</p>
