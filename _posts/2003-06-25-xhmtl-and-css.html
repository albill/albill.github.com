I&apos;ve seen a lot of hub-bub recently about using XHTML instead of older style HTML and also in doing layout with it using CSS2 so as to truly separate presentation from content.

Now, I know HTML pretty well and basic CSS but all of my books and knowledge are years old for the most part. Does anyone know of good books on XHTML and using the full set of CSS2 formatting?
