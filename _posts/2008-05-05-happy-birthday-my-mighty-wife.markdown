I want to wish my wife, tolerant and heroic soul that she is, a very happy birthday. As you can imagine, she is a bodhisattva with unlimited and heroic compassion for her grump filled, bookish and nerdish spouse.

I've been very fortunate that I seem able to remember this day reliably, for some reason.
