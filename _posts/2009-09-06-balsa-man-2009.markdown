This year, R and I had to forgo the great joy of attending Burning Man.
To be honest, we went last year and swore that we wouldn't go two years
in a row. Then I had the "year of illin" which has left me with sleep
issues and my doctoral program started at the same time as Burning Man.
This meant that it was just impractical to go (and we're thinking of
going to Hawaii in January anyway). As an alternative, we decided to
attend the mighty [Balsa Man](http://balsaman.org/) event for 2009. It,
of course, is in no way, shape, or form related to Burning Man in any
way nor does it derive any of its symbolism and forms from Burning Man,
such as this:

This was Balsa Man's second year (and I hear last year was better...). I
am told by the organizer that last year saw about 50 people showing up
by word of mouth. This year, it was 200 or 300 people. Still, that's
actually pretty small if you consider the would-be hipster numbers of
the Bay Area. Balsa Man, being a 1/16th scale event with its 35 inch
tall man, encourages people to make art with this year's theme being
"Big Dreams, Writ Small." R and I decided, late the evening before the
event, to make our own art to contribute. I settled on the Monolith and
ape-men of 2001 constructed out of legos. We did a late evening trip to
target and R went and acquired the Burning Man stape of faux fur the
next morning. With some glue, pain, and a bit of building, we created
our piece:
[![Monolith -

This piece seemed to be accepted fairly well with its simple but iconic
origins. I noticed a lot of people giggling and taking photos of it (and
no one stepped on it). R and I braved the mutli-bridge transit (with the
Bay Bridge being closed this weekend) and made it to the unnamed beach
just as things were getting going. We managed to run into a couple of
friends and took a look at all of the tiny art. I put a [picture
set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157622137958241/) on
Flickr and there is a [Balsa Man
2009](http://www.flickr.com/groups/balsaman2009/pool/) pool of photos as
well. After a couple of hours, there was a fairly quick burn (man, balsa
burns fast with accelerants!) and it was over for the year. I expect
that there will be more Balsa Man events (and perhaps regional
spin-offs) in the years to come as well.

**Update:** Here is video of the burn:
