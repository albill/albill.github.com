I gave up my cell phone about two months ago, maybe a little less. I'd
felt I wasn't using it enough and it was just an expense. Of course, as
soon as it was gone, I found myself in situations where I wanted to call
my wife while out or I was delayed in going to mass or... that sort of
thing. People couldn't call me wherever I was when I was just out doing
nothing special. So I picked up a new phone. We have a discounts through
work so I wound up getting a [Motorola mpx220
smartphone](http://www.motorola.com/mdirect/hellomoto/experience/mpx220/flash/default.shtml)
for 30% of the list price with no activation fee or setup charges. It
showed up at work today and after a little configuration difficulties, I
got it working. Luckily, something like six or so of my coworkers seem
to have one so I was able to compare notes. I've got it set up now so I
can synch, via the cell network, my work Outlook mail, calendar and
contacts. By switching one setting, I can synch my personal IMAP-based
e-mail account with a different inbox. I sent some test messages, logged
into messenger, etc. and it all works seamlessly. I just wish it was
faster. Pretty cool stuff though. It really is a decent PDA as well as a
phone. I managed to take a few action shots of afternoon bug triage to
try out the built in 1.1 megapixel camera.
