I'm finding myself more and more in tune with contemplative work and
meditation these days as opposed to just magical ritual for its own
sake. I picked up a copy of Walsh's **Essential Spirituality** this week
after reading a recommendation of it in Ken Wilber's work and it seems
like an interesting volume. I've also begun rereading Ngakpa Chogyam's
**Journey into Vastness** on meditation work (even though I wouldn't
trust him much in other contexts). How many of you work with
contemplative disciplines and what texts or work do you find of most
value there? Ignatius Loyola? ;-)
