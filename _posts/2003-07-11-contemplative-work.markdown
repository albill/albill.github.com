I&apos;m finding myself more and more in tune with contemplative work and meditation these days as opposed to just magical ritual for its own sake. I picked up a copy of Walsh&apos;s <b>Essential Spirituality</b> this week after reading a recommendation of it in Ken Wilber&apos;s work and it seems like an interesting volume. I&apos;ve also begun rereading Ngakpa Chogyam&apos;s <b>Journey into Vastness</b> on meditation work (even though I wouldn&apos;t trust him much in other contexts). How many of you work with contemplative disciplines and what texts or work do you find of most value there? Ignatius Loyola? ;-)
