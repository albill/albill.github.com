I just found out that all of the episodes of <a href="http://www.destroy-all-monsters.com/sacepisodeguide.shtml">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a> are available on DVD. I've been looking for some anime to watch since finishing <strong>Cowboy Bebop</strong> and <strong>Trigun</strong>. I liked the movie and I've been looking forward to the new one coming out.

So I ordered the boxed set of this tv show this evening. All 26 episodes of fun. I even found it for about $40.<br clear="all" />
