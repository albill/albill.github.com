In about thirteen hours, R and I will be on a plane from SFO to Tokyo. I'll be posting pictures from my new Fujifilm Finepix F50 and blogging while we are there so don't expect me to completely disappear.

For those with my e-mail address, I'll probably be checking e-mail daily, at least once we've made it to Kyoto, where I know we have net access in our room.

For all my coworkers working on the next Mozilla release, I'll be thinking of you and the release (while relaxing and laughing). Have fun, guys!
