I just found a link to this on Google Video this morning. I haven't had the time to watch it but I thought that I would share it out. <strong><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8508306087653444091">Zen Master Seung Sahn's "Wake up! On the Road with a Zen Master"</a></strong> "Zen Master Seung Sahn's teaching documentary "Wake up! On the Road with a Zen Master". A professional and entertaining documentary that captures Zen Master Seung Sahn's energy while presenting the core of his teaching. Wake Up! is not only a rare portrait of an unusual and provocative teacher, but also an introduction to Zen Buddhism today. Wake Up! was shot on location during a teaching trip in Europe by award-winning independent filmmaker Brad Anderson from Boston." <lj-embed><embed id="VideoPlayback" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docid=-8508306087653444091&hl=en&fs=true" style="width:400px;height:326px" allowFullScreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" type="application/x-shockwave-flash">
