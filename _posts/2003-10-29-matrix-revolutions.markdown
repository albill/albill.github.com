I've been looking closely at the released trailers for the Matrix
Revolutions and I just noticed a "real world" shot with a ship
(obviously piloted by Neo and Trinity) is crashing into the ground. The
interesting thing is that the shot is at an up angle and you can see a
large break in the eternal cloud cover ("burned sky") behind them and
the moon showing through. I wonder if that is a plot point?
