I'm going to the Wrathful Guru Rinpoche empowerment in a couple of hours at Chagdud Gonpa Amrita. I've been looking forward to this.

<blockquote><em>Now, in the pure depth of the heavens,
Vajrasattva, allowing the Metamorphic Body to be seen,
seared upon an elephant, holding a golden vajra to his heart
with his right hand, and with his left hand
holding a silver bell at his side,
crowned with the ornaments of the Five Transcendent Buddhas,
his body covered with all the perfect ornaments,
decorated with bones at the shoulders, at the wrists,
and at the ankles, brilliant with the white glitter of crystal.
Perfectly learned in the Mahayoga, Vajrasattva
reveals as a dwelling the celestial palace of the three Baskets,
reveals as gods and goddesses the whole internal essence,
reveals as Mantra the entire murmur of the words,
reveals as enchantments everything which is of body, speech, and mind.
And he sets forth the Tantras of the Mahayoga,
which are, according to the whole classification, five hundred thousand,
and the whole of which forms the eighteen root Tantras.</em></blockquote>
