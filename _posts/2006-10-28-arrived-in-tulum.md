We took the red eye flight to the East Coast and flew from Charlotte to Cancun. We then got our rental car, fended off the hard sell for tours from the car people, and drove an hour and a half to Tulum.

We have occasional internet access if I wander into the main lobby and ask for the ethernet cable. I probably will do that once or twice a day as we're waiting to see if our house offer was accepted. I may upload some photos over the next few days too.

Other than that, we're wiped and just getting our little bungalow on the beach. Time for a nap.
