This is from [BoingBoing
Blog](http://www.khephra.org/ct.ashx?id=99e869eb-13c2-4e16-a865-2d089718139f&url=http://boingboing.net/):
[Orkut](/　), the recently-launched, Google-affiliated FOAF (Cory
critiques them -- and the bigger FOAF picture -- [here](/　)), is offline
for a while. Before the temporary beta outage, Warren Ellis logged on,
sniffed around, then said:

> Right now, it looks pretty much like an iteration of the Tribe.net
> system, with an eye on Friendster's apparent main function as a dating
> system. (Which means, oddly, it requests your business profile at the
> same time as it's asking you where you like to be fingered.) (...)
> It's faster than Fuckster and Tribe, but it shows that all these
> friend-of-a-friend things have really hit a wall. I mean, what can you
> actually do aside from invite all your friends and piss about on a
> couple of small message boards? Message boards that, unlike Tribe,
> allow anonymous postings and therefore devalue the message board
> experience? What happens after that? After you've gotten all your
> friends in -- whom you send email to or IM regularly in any case,
> presumably. That's it. All done. Until, I guess, yet another social
> network system opens and you start all over again. These things want
> to be a hub for your Internet community experience, but they're just
> not necessary enough. Tribe gets closest, but it's nothing you're
> going to leave as an open window on your desktop all day. The first
> new social network system that builds an IM program into its structure
> may have a shot. The Delphiforums message boards have Jabber tacked on
> to them, which would have been brilliant when Delphi was at its
> height, but has gone pretty much unnoticed in the wake of their
> self-mutilating half-smart attempts to monetise. The idea was and is
> sound. The minute you make these things the easiest and most direct
> way to communicate with the personal network the system's let you
> build or collate, there's going to be a reason to keep the site on
> your desktop. And that has to be their goal. I mean, who builds a
> social network system that doesn't want people to use it all the time?
