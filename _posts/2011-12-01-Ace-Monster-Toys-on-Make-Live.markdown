[Ace Monster Toys](http://acemonstertoys.org) was approached recently to appear [Make: Live](http://makezine.com/live/) as part of their "Hackerspace Roadshow." As their page says, Make: Live is a streaming show and tell show from people at Make magazine. Given that I own every issue of Make and, of course, all officers of a hackerspace are unable to turn down free press, we agreed to be on their show.

Make: Live had done a first Hackerspace Roadshow this last year, profiling a number of other hackerspaces around the United States, including our sister (cousin?) space in San Francisco, [Noisebridge](http://noisebridge.net). This time, they profiled [Ace Monster Toys](http://acemonstertoys.org) (of Oakland!), [Hive13](http://www.hive13.org)</a> in Cincinnati, 
[Perth Artifactory](http://artifactory.org.au/) in Perth, and [Tokyo Hackerspace](http://tokyohackerspace.org) in, you guessed it, Tokyo! A little more international this time.

For the show, they asked us to give a brief tour of the space, show our coolest tool, maybe give a little history, and then show some projects. I gave the tour (under some duress) and Stacy, Chris, and Atom Bomb all showed their projects (which are far cooler than my touring ability). 

You can see all of the shows right now on the [Make: Live](http://makezine.com/live/) web page. The videos are also up on Youtube. I've put the AMT video inline below or you can [watch it there](http://youtu.be/qIummpkWOAI).
