I'm sitting in Sea-Tac airport right now waiting for my flight back to
Oakland. I've had a good visit over the last few days but did not have
the time to see everyone that I wanted to see. R and I will have to come
up together sometime in the next few months to see people. I'll post
more tomorrow when I'm not using a Treo to do it.
