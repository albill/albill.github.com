Well, I missed the class tonight. I was set to leave work by 5:50 or so in order to get to the 7:00 pm class but my boss wanted to chat about the usefulness (or sometimes lack thereof) of a meeting that I was shoehorned into creating and running every week in the first place. Someone who I hadn&apos;t even invited complained that it was efficient enough for him and my boss wanted to talk about setting better goals for the meeting, etc. etc. This is a meeting for a virtual team and none of us have more than moral authority over the others so it is really a matter of my keeping the pretense of authority and control and using it to force, if necessary, the other teams to get with the overall program. 

It&apos;s kind of funny because, outside of work, I think I&apos;m viewed as this type A overcontroling directive type but at work I&apos;m much more on the milder end of the spectrum in being dictatorial and I really don&apos;t even want to run this stupid meeting but I&apos;m the only one set up to do so.

In any case, we didn&apos;t get done until 6:30 (and we didn&apos;t even get to yelling volume at each other this time) though we&apos;ll do round 2 at my one on one on Friday. Traffic on the bridges was fuxored so I just came home instead. I was never going to get to the class before 7:30 or 7:45.
