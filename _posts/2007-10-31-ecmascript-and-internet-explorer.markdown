Chris Wilson, the Platform Architect for IE (and generally a reasonable
fellow) has put up a [short
post](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/10/30/ecmascript-3-and-beyond.aspx)
on the IEBlog on ECMAScript 4. I'll quote it in its entirely since it is
nearly gnomic in its brevity:

> ### ECMAScript 3 and Beyond
>
> There have been a number of blog posts recently about JavaScript
> developments, e.g. Gabriele Renziâ€™s "[ECMAScript 4, the fourth system
> syndrome](http://www.riffraff.info/2007/10/25/ecmascript-4-the-fourth-system-syndrome)".
> For ECMAScript, we here on the IE team certainly believe that
> thoughtful evolution is the right way to go; as I've frequently spoken
> about publicly, compatibility with the current web ecosystem - not
> "breaking the Web" - is something we take very seriously. In our
> opinion, a revolution in ECMAScript would be best done with an
> entirely new language, so we could continue supporting existing users
> as well as freeing the new language from constraints (including the
> constraint of performantly supporting scripts written in the old
> language). My colleague Pratap (our representative on the ECMAScript
> Technical Committee) with the JScript team, just posted on [their
> blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/jscript/) about some [work they've
> done](http://blogs.msdn.com/jscript/archive/2007/10/29/ecmascript-3-and-beyond.aspx)
> on this topic. We're also very interested in feedback from JavaScript
> web and framework developers on their thoughts about their needs and
> the future of the language.

![Gorilla!](http://www.arcanology.com/images/ie-gorilla.jpg)I gather
from Chris' post that, while they aren't going to out and out say so, it
is very unlikely that IE will support ECMAScript 4 in IE8 (or perhaps
even beyond that). I find that to be too bad. I'm pretty opinion neutral
on ECMAScript 4 as a standard as I don't know a lot of the ins and outs
and am not that terribly great of a Javascript Commando. I am pretty
positive on the idea of the web continuing to evolve and doing so in a
way that embraces new standards. The alternative is that the web
continues to evolve but does so in a partisan way not based on
standards. I don't think the net will discontinue its state of constant
change, as inconvenient as that may be for the IE team and its plans for
global domination through "not breaking the Web" and freezing us at 2001
(*joke!*). If the Internet is going to change and develop anyway, they
might as well get on the train with everyone else and support standards
that people get together and agree on. Otherwise, IE runs the risk of
their browser share simply eroding away as the rest of the world moves
forward. Of course, many of us are pretty convinced that this is going
to happen anyway and it isn't a bad thing. The problem here is that as
long as IE comes with an operating system that has the majority of the
market, it is still going to be the 500 lb. gorilla sitting sullenly in
the corner. **Update for 10/31**: Chris Wilson has [posted a much longer
personal
response](http://blogs.msdn.com/cwilso/archive/2007/10/31/what-i-think-about-es4.aspx)
today to the accusations by various parties that IE is trying to stop
the web from moving forward. It is worth a read.
