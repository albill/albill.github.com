<blockquote>Do not believe in what you have heard.

Do not believe in tradition just because it is handed down over many generations.

Do not believe in anything just because it has been spoken many times.

Do not believe just because written statements come from some old sage.

Do not believe in conjecture.

Do not believe in authority or teachers or elders.

But after careful observation and analysis, when it agrees with reason and it will benefit one and all, then accept it and live by it.</blockquote>-- The Buddha
