The whole party was themed along white trash lines. Many wife beaters, house coats, gimme caps and other bad clothes were there in spades. The musical soundtrack for the event seemed to be mostly 80s hair bands with the occasional throwback to early Black Sabbath, Dio, or Van Halen from the 70s.

Velveeta cheese dip, Chili Mac n' Cheese, mustard sardines, jello with stuff in it, some kind of Frito chip pie..and lots of PBR!
