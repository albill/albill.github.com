R and I just got back from Ashley's "White Trash" birthday party. The
whole party was themed along white trash lines. Many wife beaters, house
coats, gimme caps and other bad clothes were there in spades. The
musical soundtrack for the event seemed to be mostly 80s hair bands with
the occasional throwback to early Black Sabbath, Dio, or Van Halen from
the 70s.

The food, of course, was questionable. Velveeta cheese dip, Chili Mac n'
Cheese, mustard sardines, jello with stuff in it, some kind of Frito
chip pie..and lots of PBR!

It was a fun event and some people went all out with their Value Village
wardrobe.
