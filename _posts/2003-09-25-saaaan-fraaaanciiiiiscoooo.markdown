R and I are just off of Haight in San Francisco now. We flew in uneventfully after getting up at God-awful-early and are staying at the Red Victorian Bed and Breakfast on Haight tonight. I always love coming here and never seem to spend enough time down here. If it wasn't so damn expensive (and if I didn't have a child and career in Seattle), I'd move here.

We're going to bum around and maybe shop a bit. heh. We've already gone to Field's Books today. Tomorrow we are going down to Santa Cruz...

My mom is coming to town. Feel free to come see her present:

Seattle Pagan Scholars presents Gretchen Faulk on "Nuit, The Limitless Goddess"
Date: Sunday, October 19, 2003
Time: 1 p.m. socializing, 2 p.m. lecture
Place: Seattle Art Museum downtown
Cost: $5 suggested donation (not mandantory! everyone is welcome!)

Presentation description:
Nuit The Limitless Goddess

Popular Egyptology refers to Nuit as "The Sky Goddess." To the ancients, Nuit was more than the stars above, she was the very fabric of space within whose body were the dimensions of all life and eternity.  What is the relation of this Goddess to the modern day? Who is she now?

This presentation by Gretchen Faulk will explore Nuit's role in Egyptian cosmology and religion.  An overview of her iconography will equip you to recognize and appreciate her in Egyptian art.  Then we move on to 1904 Cairo, and the experiences of Aleister Crowley with the Lady of the 'Stele of Revealing.'  Nuit speaks for herself in Liber al vel Legis. A personal spiritual interpretation reveals Nuit as the Initiator of a new paradigm for modern Magick. Please join Sor. Ashera as we explore the symbols, character and message of the Starry One of Heaven.

The program was recently offered at the International O.T.O. Conference in Portland, Oregon; Notocon '03. This version is slightly expanded.
