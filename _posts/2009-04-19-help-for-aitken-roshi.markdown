I know others have mentioned this but I don't think it can be said too
many times, [Robert Aitken
Roshi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baker_Aitken) is one of the
earliest Western teachers of Zen still alive today. He was exposed to
Zen while in a Japanese internment camp in Kobe, Japan after being
captured as a worker in Guam. Following the war, he went on to study in
America and then in Japan before returning to the States. He has been
teaching here in the West continually for 50 years now. I've read a
number of his books and have learned a lot from them. Aitken Roshi has
been sick for a number of years now, suffering a stroke a few years ago.
While he isn't destitute, he does require round the clock care. I read
today that he's been diagnosed with Parkinson's recently but has been
active in his sangha in spite of his illness. Because of his care
requirements, there has been a general call to the Buddhist community
for support and financial help for Aitken Roshi, a man who has given his
life to the Dharma. He is not going to be able to afford the care on his
own for very long and there is no retirement plan for Zen masters. I've
donated to help and I would encourage others to consider doing the same
as well. You can find out more information, as well as give donatations,
at [http://www.aitkenroshi.org](http://www.aitkenroshi.org).
