R and I went over to San Francisco for the [**Laughing Squid: Decade
2**](http://laughingsquid.com/laughing-squid-decade-2/) party last
night. This was the 11th anniversary party for [Laughing
Squid](http://www.laughingsquid.com), a Bay Area institution at this
point. We ran into a couple of people that we knew, stayed for a couple
of bands and laughs and then ducked out a little before midnight. I've
put up a [photo
set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157594382935857/) on
Flickr from the event. Taking pictures at night events in clubs is
always kind of iffy so these photos are what they are. Here are a couple
of my lovely wife though. :-)
