Thanks to <lj user="nemo49"> for this one...</lj>

Further adventures of the anti-hero of <strong>Pitch Black</strong>, Riddick:

Evil cultists, silly action, etc.

On a finer movie note, I just watched Akira Kurosawa's <strong>Hidden Fortress</strong> this morning. I hadn't actually seen it ever before. I quite liked it and consider it defnitely in the category of not just "Fine Japanese Films" but fine films in general.

<em>The life of a man
Burn it with the fire
The life of an insect
Throw it in the fire
Ponder and you'll see
The world is dark
And this floating world
Is a dream</em>

I just found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0571199828/">this book</a> listed online about Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune's work.

Many of you probably don't know since you don't know me personally but I grew up, starting as a child young enough that I couldn't read, watching Akira Kurosawa's work and have fond memories from that period of seeing Toshira Mifune on screen. With a rare display of intelligence, I managed to see <strong>Ran</strong> in its first, limited, run in the U.S. when I was a teen. My mother was a Nipponophile when I was a child and I know that she was hot to give me the name "Toshiro" before I was born, though I am, instead, named the same as my father and his father before him. (No, I'm not making this up. I would have been "Toshiro Billings." For a girl, I believe it was "Mariko Sallee Billings." My grandmother's name is "Mae Sallee Beals" with the first two being one of those two part southern names like "Sue Ellen.")

I don't know how it turned out that I'd never seen this one film but I'm glad that I finally have.
