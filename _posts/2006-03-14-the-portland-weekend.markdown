R and I had a good time at the Thelemic Symposium this weekend. I
arrived early in the day and spent a few hours with the microfilm from
the Warburg institute. I have a set of scans of a Crowley's handwritten
copies of some of the material from the Hermetic Order of the Golden
Dawn. The symposium was interesting in and of itself. We got to hear
three longterm Thelemites give their answers to a variety of questions
on the nature of Will, the OTO, syncretism, and various other topics.
Following this, there was a party for a number of hours and I got to
visit with quite a few friends that I only see in the flesh every year
or two. On Sunday, R and I found a cool breakfast place ("The Roxy") a
block from our hotel. It had a full on Roman Catholic Church crucifix
hanging on the wall (the kind that is about fifteen feet tall) with a
glowing neon halo around Jesus' head. Cool decor. Afterwards, I spent
about an hour and a half in Powells Books and picked up a few things
such as a book by Charlie Huston (a novel) and a text on Shingon
Buddhism (Tendai's brother mikkyo tradition). We had an easy and
uneventful drive back and still had time to get other things done. The
filled in ex-pool seems to be draining properly. There is an older sump
pit next to it that was there even when we had the pool. We laid the
rock in such a way that the water was supposed to still drain into the
pit (so I could pump it out). This works properly. The soil itself is on
landscape matting so the water just drains away. I just need grass to
grow now.
