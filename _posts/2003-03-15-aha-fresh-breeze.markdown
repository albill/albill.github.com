I found <a href="http://www.fuckthatjob.com/">Fuckthatjob.com</a> today and have been reading it.

When I worked as a web designer, I had one of these jobs. I got paid shit for the work I was doing because they had hired me internally from outside of engineering (I was originally tech support). I finally said "Fuck this! I'm getting paid jack!" and went and became a software tester. On my first QA job, my pay went up 50% and I was making double what I had made within about two years (and going from contract to permanent).

The idea of making less at a tech job than I would make working in a store is ludicrous.
