R and I will be on our way back to the States in about 12 hours from London. We arrived here from Egypt two days ago. In Egypt, we were pretty out of luck for net access and I'm typing this on my iPhone, actually.

Yesterday, we rode around London sightseeing, including visiting the Tower of London. We returned there last night for the ceremony of the keys. Today, we spent most of the day in the British Museum and then went to see the Monty Python musical, "Spamalot," at the Palace Theatre.

I'll be uploading a lot of photos of Egypt within a day and will be posting more once we are back.
