I took some time last night and exported most of the year 2002 from my old Livejournal account to XML and then imported it into this blog. I need to do 2003 and some weeding still.

Since LJ is a different sort of blogging method where people read their "Friends" (Blogroll) fairly closely and directly comment on each other's posts, many of the posts are much more chatty than my current blog. It is very common on LJ to say things like "I want to go to such and such show this weekend. Who is up for it?" and get replies.

I did this to start getting my four or so years of blogging off of LJ, which doesn't have a search feature and is a pretty closed system, into Wordpress, which puts all of the data into a mysql database. I want to have control of my data and to have it more centralized.
