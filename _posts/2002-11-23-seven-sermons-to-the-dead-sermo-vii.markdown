Well, God rested on the seventh day or something and I forgot to post
the last one. ;-) **Sermo VII** Yet when night was come the dead again
approached with lamentable mien and said: There is yet one matter we
forgot to mention. Teach us about man. Man is a gateway, through which
from the outer world of gods, daemons, and souls ye pass into the inner
world; out of the greater into the smaller world. Small and transitory
is man. Already is he behind you, and once again ye find yourselves in
endless space, in the smaller or innermost infinity. At immeasurable
distance standeth one single Star in the zenith. This is the one god of
this one man. This is his world, his pleroma, his divinity. In this
world is man Abraxas, the creator and destroyer of his one world. This
Star is the god and the goal of man. This is his one guiding god. In him
goeth man to his rest. Toward him goeth the long journey of the soul
after death. In him shineth forth as light all that man bringeth back
from the greater world. To this one god man shall pray. Prayer
increaseth the light of the Star. It casteth a bridge over death. It
prepareth life for the smaller world and assuageth the hopleless desires
of the greater. When the greater world waxeth cold, burneth the Star.
Between man and his one god there standeth nothing, so long as man can
turn away his eyes from the flaming spectacle of Abraxas. Man here, god
there. Weakness and nothingness here, there eternally creative power.
Here nothing but darkness and chilling moisture. There wholly sun.
Whereupon the dead were silent and ascended like the smoke above the
herdmanâ€™s fire, who through the night kept watch over his flock.
