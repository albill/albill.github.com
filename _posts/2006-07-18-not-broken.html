I used to think that there was a flaw that ran through the heart of the world and I wondered where this flaw came from, the deep and abiding dissatisfaction with all that is... I wondered how, why, and when I had been lied to...the lies that we have all taken in with our mother's milk, our daily lessons in pain, suffering, want, and desire...

Then I realized that the flaw in the world was an imperfection of vision, the mote in my own eye. There is no flaw through the heart of the world, there is only the smokey mist that surrounds me like a nimbus, exhaled on my own breath. I need look no farther than my own Self to find that flaw. It isn't the world, it is me but even that is an illusion because there is no 'me' or 'I' or Self of any sort...only self.

They say that the best trick that the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world that he didn't exist... the best (or worst) trick that we have ever pulled is convincing ourselves that we do exist. Our dissatisfaction with the world is nothing more than our own self-created desires pulling at the nature of things and finding that there is Nothing. There is no you, there is no me, and in our nothingness, the world's nothingness, there is no pain, no suffering, and no dissatisfaction.

The world is as it always has been and not. It is self-perfected, a gleam of faery gold that sparkles one moment and turns to dust in another. It was never there and neither were we. All is perfect in its emptiness.
