<p>I took my Fellowcraft initiation with the Freemasons this evening at Doric Lodge #92 in Seattle. This lodge is home to a good friend of mine and some acquaintances. I must say that they did a good job for us (there were multiple candidates) and the degree work was most impressive. I'm very happy to have had the opportunity to go through this with these men.</p>

<p>I expect that I will take the Master Mason degree within the next few months, which will make me a full mason and allow me to join a couple of the organizations that have interests related to my own beyond masonry itself.</p>
