I start my Master's program in 8 days...<cue ominous theme music\> I'm
trying not to think about it too much because of all of the unknowns
about what it will be like to work on the program, do the papers,
readings, etc. etc. The big thing that I really need to do is figure out
a decent thesis in the area of History that I want to do. The program
allows for independent studies outside of the assigned classes for
electives. If there are specific books or areas of study for my thesis,
I can arrange to do an independent study for credit. This means that I
need to figure out things sooner rather than later. Here is a list of
general areas of interest that I'd posted before that are fairly
general:

1.  Neopaganism in the last few decades, specifically in North America.
2.  Western Esotercism since the Renaissance, specifically English
    speaking.
3.  Secret Societies/Fraternal Orders, either the "occult" or more
    strictly Masonic style.
4.  Tantric Buddhism and the West
5.  Fringe religious movements in North America within the last 200
    years or so...

From this list, I did a **really** rough brainstorming of potential
high-level thesis ideas. I haven't really narrowed this down since then.
None of these are concrete to the point of being "What question with
this thesis answer?" which is where one would want to be before I
started work.

-   Neopagan History in North America
    -   **Pacific Northwest Neopaganism:** it's early days, founding
        members, early or influential groups.
    -   **History of a specific organization or cult of practice**:
        There have been many groups of different sorts. Horus-Maat
        Lodge?

-   A History of a Fraternal or Occult Order in North America
    -   **Find a specific and obscure occult order and disect its
        writings, ritual work, organizational structure, etc.** -- I
        know these are out there. I was a member of one and have a set
        of materials that match the kind of thing that I'd want to work
        on but because of obvious issues with bias, personal history,
        oaths to members, etc. I wouldn't use that one. There have been
        many others. One back before the last World War or in the 50s
        would be ideal. The goal here would also have to take into
        account treating people and beliefs with respect. *This is my
        overall favorite but I have no leads at this point. The Golden
        Dawn or SRIA is still a possibility.*
    -   **Scholastic Examination of one of the many 19th Century Masonic
        Style orders**: similar to the idea above except this would not
        touch on Esotericism as much. *The Sons of Hur* or something
        similar.

-   A History of a "Fringe" Religious Movement
    -   **Role of non-African People in African Diasporic Religions**:
        Lots of European descended people seem to be getting involved
        with Santeria or Voudon. How's that work out?
    -   **Obscure Utopian Religious Cults**: There have been a number of
        groups that I personally know about in the Pacific Northwest,
        some of which still survive: The Love Israel Family, the
        Venusian Church...
    -   **The Adinaths/AMOOKOS**: Dadaji and company. Complicated by the
        sue happy nature of the fellow that claims the copyright on
        Dadaji's work.
    -   **One of the weird "Western Tantra" Groups**: Like Saraswati or
        something.

-   Tantric Buddhism in the West
    -   No specific ideas here but it is an interest of mine as a
        practitioner and an intellectual student of Vajryana and
        Dzogchen.

I'm still kind of stumped though. Theoretically, since I'm in a
"Humanities" MA, I could do the interdisciplinary focus instead of doing
the history concentration and tie in literature, art, or philosophy as
well.
