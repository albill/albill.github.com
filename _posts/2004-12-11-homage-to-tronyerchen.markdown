I found a nice book on the 21 Taras today that I may purchase. It is <strong><a href="http://www.skydancerpress.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=11&amp;Itemid=30">The Smile of Sun and Moon</a></strong> and it follows Jigme Lingpa's teachings among others.

The book has some wonderful images as well:

<h3>Homage, Mother, who hits the earth
with the palm of her hand,
Who pounds on it with her feet.
Frowning wrathfully, she shatters
The seven underworlds by the sound of HUM.</h3>
