I found a nice book on the 21 Taras today that I may purchase. It is
**[The Smile of Sun and
Moon](http://www.skydancerpress.com/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=11&Itemid=30)**
and it follows Jigme Lingpa's teachings among others. The book has some
wonderful images as well:

## Noble Lady Tara Tronyerchen

### Homage, Mother, who hits the earth with the palm of her hand, Who
pounds on it with her feet. Frowning wrathfully, she shatters The seven
underworlds by the sound of HUM.
