R and I had dinner with Kat, her boyfriend, and Lefty this evening. We met at a nice little Japanese restaurant in Japantown in San Francisco. En-no-gyoja is in town for a Linux conference and this is the first time we've seen him in person in a couple of years (he lives a bit further south normally).

I arrived a bit early so I was able to visit the wonderful Japanese bookstore in the Japantown mally-thing, which was in the same complex as the restaurant. I bought a manga done by the creators <strong>Lone Wolf and Cub</strong>. This was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593075022/"><strong>Path of the Assassin</strong></a> and chronicles the story of Hattori Hanzo. I also bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0822337746/"><strong>Full Metal Apache</strong></a>, which is on the borrowing between Japanese and American culture in the context of manga and science fiction, especially cyberpunk. It has chapters on William Gibson's influences (incoming and outgoing), <em>Tetsuo</em>, and many others. I also got a nice book with many old illustrations on Japanese ghosts and demons. All fun stuff.

Dinner was a lot of fun and it was good to get over to the city for a few hours.
