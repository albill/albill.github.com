I'm almost done with the first four chapters of my thesis. I'm looking
for people to proof it, especially for factual consistency with the
Golden Dawn or pointing out places where I go "blah blah blah" but don't
seem to go anywhere or make it relevant. There is no way that I can
easily go through all of this on my own given the length and how close I
am to the material after going over it again and again. If you are
interested in helping me, please let me know. I would like to limit this
to people with a writing, scholastic or some kind of academic background
because I need the feedback to be as focused as possible. If you think
that you can provide me with this kind of feedback and are willing to
read about 28 pages pages (single spaced) of text on the Golden Dawn and
Western Esotericism, let me know.
