For a while now, my friend, [Kat Lunoe](http://nondualelf.com/%22), has
been working on a painting for me. Kat is a local magician and artist
who has done some excellent work, especially for the
[cover](http://nondualelf.com/artwork/1875995_All_Beneficent_Ra_Hoor_Khuit.html)
of Sam Webster's "[Tantric
Thelema](http://www.concrescent.net/book/tantric-thelema)" book. She's
also a tantric (vajrayana) practitioner and we've had a number of
excellent discussions on matters tantric. I've been wanting an image of
[Fudō Myōō](http://www.shingon.org/deities/jusanbutsu/fudo.html) for
quite some time. Fudo-sama is an important figure in Japanese mikkyo,
Japan's form of tantric Buddhism. You will see central Fudo images in
most (all?) Shingon and Tendai temples. He's considered to be a form of
Dainichi Nyorai by some though technically, he's one of the five
vidyarajas, the "light kings" or "wisdom kings" that date back to the
origins of tantric Buddhism in India and who are ferocious protectors of
the Dharma. Because of my existing relationship (largely undiscussed
here) to tantra, including Japanese tantra, I've wanted an excellent
shrine image of Fudo-sama. Екатерина produced a wonderful image for me
over many months of work. This is something that I'm both proud to have
as part an altar and that I consider a wonderful and very personal work
of art. For those interested in prints of this image, Kat is potentially
willing to produce them. You should contact her through her website at
[nondualelf.com](http://nondualelf.com/%22).
