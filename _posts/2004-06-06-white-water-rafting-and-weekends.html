                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Today, R and I went white water rafting on the Wenatchee river out on the other side of the pass.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              This was arranged by a coworker and friend of R's. Last year, we did a similar trip arranged by her with some friends and co-workers but it was much later in the season. On that occasion, the river was fairly low and it was much more of a relaxing trip. We didn't wear wet suits and actually swam a bit.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              This year, the amount of water flowing through was about seven times that level. This is fairly early in the season and the water is fairly high and it is still cold enough outside there to wear the wet suits. I must say, it was a completely different experience. We did a lot more of the stereotypical "white water" bit shooting rapids and dropping into holes and such. It was a lot of fun and I'd like to do a lot more of it.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The trip on the river, itself, was about four hours long with dinner afterwards and some prep time before. This isn't so bad but it is a two and a half hour drive there and the same back. Needles to say, we left Sunday morning around 7:30 AM and we actually arrived home right about 7:30 PM. That's a full day.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Overall, the weekend was fairly fun. On Saturday, R and I slept in a bit and my daughter was dropped off by my ex-wife around noon. Madeline and I hung out for an hour and a half or so watching cartoons and then went down to the theatre to see <b>Shrek 2</b>, which was a lot of fun. I actually liked it about as much as the first (which is a good thing). It's definitely a fun one for the kids and adults together.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              In the evening, R and I went to the birthday bash for a friend of mine from work, Felicity. A new bar/pub just opened up under her apartment building on lower Queen Anne so we met up there for a few drinks. We met a number of her friends and got to chat with some nice people. We actually spent some time comparing notes with a few people that had travelled quite a bit and it rekindled some of the desire that R and I have to travel to a new country every year for a couple of weeks if possible. After an hour and a half or so, we ducked out and grabbed some of the local Thai food. Mmmm....

This was pretty low key and we spent the first couple of hours BBQing food, hanging out and having a couple of beers. After it got dark, we did our first full moon ritual together as a group. I feel that it went pretty well and that good things will be coming from us working together. I still plan on using it to feed, to some extent, into the prison work I'm doing with Wiccans.
