I hung up the images of the <a href="http://thmodin.club.fr/English/kongokai.htm">Kongokai</a> and <a href="http://thmodin.club.fr/English/taizokai.htm">Taizokai</a> mandalas at my altar (butsudan) this evening. These are the two mandalas primarily used in mikkyo, Japanese esoteric Buddhism, and they normally flank the altar.

If I had some flowers for the altar (which I was not able to get this evening, the image would be complete).
