I hung up the images of the
[Kongokai](http://thmodin.club.fr/English/kongokai.htm) and
[Taizokai](http://thmodin.club.fr/English/taizokai.htm) mandalas at my
altar (butsudan) this evening. These are the two mandalas primarily used
in mikkyo, Japanese esoteric Buddhism, and they normally flank the
altar. If I had some flowers for the altar (which I was not able to get
this evening, the image would be complete). [![Altar - Shot
