I must be getting old or I guess I really am an adult now. Hell, my daughter turned ten recently so that's got to be some sort of milestone. Me with a ten year old kid.

I'm sitting here listening to <strong>Nevermind</strong> by Nirvana and I realize that it has been fifteen years since it came out. <em>Fifteen years?!?</em>

I was just finishing community college and waiting to transfer into the University of Washington.

I remember sitting around with my BBS geek friends at a party turning up the radio when <strong>Smells Like Teen Spirit</strong> came on. Nirvana were that local band that some of us had seen live and they kicked ass and were making it in the bigtime now.

I was just barely twenty years old when <strong>Nevermind</strong> came out. I went to the record's release party at <strong>Peaches</strong>, a record store in the University District where a computer store is now. (As it turns out, my boss of the last five years, until recently, was there too, as was my friend, John Mueller, whom I only met through Microsoft...) About 200 or so of us crowded around Nirvana as they played a little live show for the album.

After that show, I went over to <strong>Dick's</strong> to get burgers and meet my Wiccan friend, Pat. Pat was my first real friend who was gay and he brought along a girl from his coven (he was the High Priest) with him. This girl's name was "Chris Smith" and she would become my first wife. He wanted to introduce us since I was getting involved with his group and she lived in my part of town.

This was the same time that I was dating <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/tags/pleiades/">Pleiades</a>, who had <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mohmlet/sets/72057594111036959/">her first child</a> relatively recently and whom I am still friends with... Probably the oldest friend that I still have at this point that I actually talk to occasionally.

These are all of the things that come to mind when I hear this album and I realize (what a trip!) that it was so long ago for me now and what a punk ass obnoxious kid I was and how much I loved this music.
