R and I got up today, still pretty stunned about Tim&apos;s death yesterday. I gave Sam Webster a call, who we also wanted to see while we were here (we asked Sam to officiate at our wedding) and he invited us over for a little BBQ at his place.

We spent the afternoon hanging out with Sam, Joseph Max and other members of that crew of friends, some of whom are members of the Open Source Order of the Golden Dawn that Sam started. We had a nice time and people spoke quite a bit about Tim as many of them had last seen him at another BBQ at Sam&apos;s place.

There is a wake tomorrow and Joseph promised to send me the address for Kat and Tim&apos;s place (which we don&apos;t have here) and we plan on dropping by after our engagement party with R&apos;s family. I&apos;m glad people are getting together and I worry for Kat.
