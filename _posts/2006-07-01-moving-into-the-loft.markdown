We received our keys to the loft today. We now have a permanent home in
Oakland. I've included a few photos that I took today below. I have a
[set up on
Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157594184002636/) as
well. The place has two bedrooms, a bathroom and a washer and dryer
downstairs. The upstairs is what you see in the photos. Two large rooms,
one with a platform over it, with giant ceilings and lots of windows and
skylights.
