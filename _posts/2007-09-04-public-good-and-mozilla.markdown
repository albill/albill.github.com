This is a bit of a meandering post in that I touch on the very distant
(in one sense) and the very immediate in my work as QA at Mozilla.
Please forgive me... At the end of July, Mitchell Baker presented on
"The Internet, Mozilla, and the Public Benefit" at The [Internet as a
Public Good Symposium](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/ipg/Main_Page) at
Harvard. The list of sessions is
[available](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/ipg/Schedule) and slides or

I find thinking about the public good and the Internet to be
interesting. One of the primary things that drew me to Mozilla after
working in the larger corporate world and at a tech startup is that the
overall focus for Mozilla is a lot larger than filling the pockets of
the key shareholders and executives or in making it to an initial public
offering in order to cash in. The [Mozilla
Manifesto](http://www.mozilla.org/about/mozilla-manifesto.html)
addresses this in a very public way. The key principles that are
expounded there are:

1.  The Internet is an integral part of modern lifeâ€“a key component in
    education, communication, collaboration, business, entertainment and
    society as a whole.
2.  The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and
    accessible.
3.  The Internet should enrich the lives of individual human beings.
4.  Individuals' security on the Internet is fundamental and cannot be
    treated as optional.
5.  Individuals must have the ability to shape their own experiences on
    the Internet.
6.  The effectiveness of the Internet as a public resource depends upon
    interoperability (protocols, data formats, content), innovation and
    decentralized participation worldwide.
7.  Free and open source software promotes the development of the
    Internet as a public resource.
8.  Transparent community-based processes promote participation,
    accountability, and trust.
9.  Commercial involvement in the development of the Internet brings
    many benefits; a balance between commercial goals and public benefit
    is critical.
10. Magnifying the public benefit aspects of the Internet is an
    important goal, worthy of time, attention and commitment.

Now I know some people have been beating on the foundation on and off
about how these are interpreted but I think these principles stand
pretty well for the thrust of Mozilla and its projects. They are
especially telling when you compare them with the official or unofficial
principles behind many large companies in the tech world that focus on
the Internet. Many of those companies seem to be much more interested in
principles like:

1.  Maximize profits (before all else).
2.  Keep any customer in our walled garden and only our walled garden,
    no matter what.
3.  Gather as much revenue as possible from any customer without causing
    them to leave.
4.  Make short term profits and, at most, plan for the next five years.
5.  Crush our competitors and make their customers ours.

Before someone flames me, for-profit corporations are, by definition,
run for profit and to enrich the value of the corporation for the share
holders. I'm at peace with that and I do think a lot of good and
innovation can and does come out of those sorts of environments. They
aren't simply out to treat customers as a field of wheat to be reaped at
harvest time. That being said, there has to be a space, be it in
discussions, working groups, and projects, where the focus isn't simply
about enhancing shareholder value and corporate growth. Open Source is a
big part of creating such a space (and I do recognize that many
corporations contribute to and use open source tools and projects). We
need to be able to look up and create a world where we are not simply
driven by the value of the dollar. I know that a lot of people who have
been on the net for the last 20 years really miss the "old days" where
things seemed much more driven by cooperation and possibilities and less
by revenue streams. I've been on the Internet since around 1989 and it
was a very different world then (and, also, a lot less interesting one
in many ways). Both value sets needs to co-exist but I do fundamentally
believe that public good and openness are going to come out of groups
and projects that are not focused on their bottom line and a profit
motive. It is those groups that are going to think about the longterm
implications of the net and what it offers or helps create and do so in
a way that is focused more on how to then monetize it. I do think that
this hyperfocus on wealth and monetization, especially in the short
term, runs the risk of creating an online world that none of us really
want and would not ask for if we sat back and thought about it. Bringing
this back to the symposium above, I encourage people to go look at the
presentation slides from them. I do wish that audio or video from the
symposium was available to us to really flesh out the presentations
there. Taking a look at Mitchell's presentation slides, she reiterates
the principles from the Mozilla Manifesto above but also makes the point
that "Decentralized Participation" is a "Fundamental Requirement."
Projects like Firefox only succeed inasmuch as they create and foster
community around them. It is from this community that much of the hard
work is contributed and real value created. This value isn't measured
simply in terms of dollars but in the success of the project and its
ability to deliver something useful back to the community. It is the
community side of things that I see a lot of in my day to day work. The
biggest challenge that I see working on QA within Mozilla is how to get
people to participate in the less "sexy" parts of the Firefox project.
There are a lot more people contributing code than there are involved in
other aspects of the project. The fact that people contribute code is
**good** but releasing a really solid browser requires a lot more work.
The second key way that many people participate is by running the
nightly builds. This is now most of the ad-hoc QA on Firefox occurs. I'd
like to find more ways of growing the QA community but I'm not sure of
the best way to do this. We recently created
[http://quality.mozilla.org](http://quality.mozilla.org) as an effort to
help focus things but there is a lot more that could be done. Creating
the [QA Extension](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Litmus:Extension) to make it
easy to run test cases is another move in the direction because you can
use it to run a few of our manual tests and log the results. If everyone
who downloads a build ran a few tests, just two or three, every day, we
would have massive coverage on builds and quality would go up quite a
bit. The extension is still in Beta but we do expect to be using this
heavily in the future and promoting it quite a bit when it is complete.
If you have suggestions on how to improve the QA community and to
convince people to participate in increasing the quality of builds and
in running tests, I'd love to hear them, either here or on the QMO
website itself. I'll bring this lazy walk through my mind to a close
now. :-)
