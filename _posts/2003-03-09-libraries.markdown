So I went and got my University of Washington library card today... They
had no record of me in the system so it seems that the gods are smiling
on me (or sending me the message that fines go away if you wait long
enough...). I picked up four books which I'll have for two weeks max.
I'll probably photocopy three of them (I've photocopied one of them
before). The books are **[Iamblichus' *De Mysteriis*:A manifesto of the
miraculous](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/075460408X)** by Emma
Clarke (her PhD dissertation), **From Iamblichus to Eurugena: An
Investigation of the Prehistory and Evolution of the Pseudo-Dionysian
Tradition** by Stephen Gersh, **[The City of the Moon
God](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9004095136/)** by Tamara
Green (the only book on Harran, home of the last Hermeticists), and
**[Reading
Neoplatonism](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0521651581/)**
by Sara Rappe. The last of these was heavily recommended to me a while
ago by my friend, Richard. It looks at Neoplatonism as a contemplative
tradition. I expect it to be hard slogging but quite good.
