R and I took a quick trip to Seattle over this last weekend. Our friends, Autumn and Doug, were getting married and R was in the wedding party. We know the two of them, largely, from the OTO and it was a chance to see a bunch of people that we haven't seen since we moved to Oakland in mid-2006.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/2156956984/" title="DSCF2591.JPG by albill, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2015/2156956984_9d450ff09e_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" border="1" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="Capn Pepe" /></a>As you can see from the picture at the right, some of our friends are a little disturbing. That's good ol' Cap'n Pepe Nicklefinger, who we camped with at Burning Man 2001. We haven't seen him since and the last time that I had heard, he was living in a Buddhist monastery in the Southwest after doing a couple of stints actually working for the Department of Public Works for Black Rock City.

We had time while we were there to visit with a number of other friends, as well as seeing my family (including my daughter). We rang in the new year with our friends, Denny and Sophia, while staying in their <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/470984509/in/set-72157600164733864/">yurt</a>. 

The wedding was held in my old masonic lodge's hall. This allowed me to see the tracing boards that we had commissioned before I moved away from Seattle. They were done by a local mason who had done murals in another area lodge. I had seen the original proposals but not the final pieces. It was nice to get a chance to see the work up on the walls. I took a few photos but they were a bit high up so the angle isn't the best:

Needless to say, probably not the most engrossing of reports but it was nice to go home for a few days and see people.
