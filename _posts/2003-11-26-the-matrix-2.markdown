I found this at

It is an attempt to figure out the entire Matrix series. It is long and
fool of spoilers.

> Where did the

>  \
>  About the year 2199 machines gained artificial intelligence and
> humans freaked out and went to war. The machines used solar power, so
> humans scorched the sky in a nuclear winter, and the machines started
> enslaving humans and drawing off their heat for power. Now they create
> test tube babies, grow humans in fields and plug them into the Matrix
> pods when they're children, feeding them on the liquified remains of
> those who die. The Matrix was designed to provide a mental stimulus
> for the human bodies. The word Matrix is derived from the Latin word
> for "womb", which is itself derived from the Latin word for "mother",
> which is "mater".
>
> The First Matrix was designed as a perfect utopia but without choices.
> Humans did not accept it as real so they just kept waking up in their
> pods or dying. It was a disaster. So the Matrix was rebooted and
> redesigned to reflect human civilization in 1999, complete with
> freedom for people to do wrong things. Each person lived out their
> life in the Matrix program, acting and being acted upon. Free choice
> meant some people were good, others were bad, and these interactions
> created a perfect replica of reality. 99% of people accepted the
> program because of free agency. But 1% didn't, which is where the
> Architect had a problem to solve.
>
> The Architect program is pure mathematics - left brain - order. The
> Oracle program is pure intuition - right brain - chaos. It was the
> Oracle that suggested the Architect redesign the Matrix to give humans
> free agency. Since humans were to have choices, so must the programs
> sent to watch over them, so they could adapt to the variances created
> by choice, and keep things in check.
>
> To help the Oracle program understand human intuition even better, and
> thus help the Architect reduce the 1% rejection factor, the Oracle was
> to encourage people who sought enlightenment. She would prompt them
> with cryptic questions designed to draw out their free thinking. When
> they needed a special nudge, she would upgrade their ability to think
> and do with an enhancement code they would take in through the mouth;
> a cookie, some candy, etc.
>
> In the Second Matrix a person responded to this stimulus and became
> The One. They were younger than 11, and childlike in their view of
> love, right and wrong. In the trilogy we learn that people older than
> 11 seldom adjust to the non-Matrix reality because they are too fixed
> in their ways. Enhanced with upgraded abilities The One learned of the
> truth about the human condition and hacked into the program to wake
> people up. These kids banded together and used what remained of real
> world human technology to mount a resistance against the machines,
> hence the hovercraft, weapons, walkers, etc. This gear was found on
> the surface and transported down to Zion in a time before the machines
> had Sentinels patrolling. When the machines realized the underground
> pipes and passages were being used as transport conduits by their
> enemies, they started sending out the Sentinels, but by then Zion was
> operational as a command centre and the kids had grown into adults.
>
> The One of the Second Matrix eventually had enough experiences for a
> download of their knowledge into the Source to provide the Architect
> with new data to reduce the dropout rate of people plugged in. They
> were taken to the Architect's white room, and given the choice: walk
> through the Left Door to upgrade the Source with new data as was
> always intended, or walk through the Right Door back into the Matrix.
> If they chose the Right Door, the Matrix would be shut down while The
> One was inside, killing them and everyone else, and the Sentinels
> would wipe out the people in Zion. If they chose the Left Door, the
> Matrix program would get enhanced to better deal with human intuition
> and the resulting causality, and The One would be returned to the real
> world with his special program deleted (no longer The One) to select
> 16 women and 7 other men to repopulate Zion while anyone not chosen
> would be killed off by the Sentinels. This core group would then be in
> place to receive anyone else who dropped out of the Matrix program -
> which would happen because the Oracle program would continue to seek
> out and encourage kids to be The One, so the machines could further
> investigate human choice, intuition and causality.
>
> Reboot, and in comes the Third Matrix and so on until the Sixth, when
> NEO emerged as the anomaly called The One. Neo is different to the
> other Ones. He was woken up older than 11. This means instead of
> having a general love for the people in the Matrix like the younger
> Ones had, he was old enough to have a specific love for Trinity, and a
> desire to save her inside the Matrix. Which is why he chose the Right
> Door instead of the Left Door in the Architect's room.
>
> He was also different in that instead of running from the Agents he
> decided to confront them. Being a computer hacker might have given him
> a special perspective with which to operate inside the Matrix. When
> the Oracle upgraded his abilities with a cookie Neo developed the
> ability to see the Matrix in code while he was inside it. He could
> rewrite the code to stop the Agent's bullets, to reboot himself after
> being killed, to dive into Agent Smith's code and insert himself in
> its place, and even to fly.
>
> But when he dived into Smith some of the upgraded Neo code wrote onto
> the Smith code. For the first time an Agent program was unplugged from
> its normal protocols and had freedom to reboot itself and overwrite
> other entities, like Neo had done. We saw it as Smith replicating
> himself.
>
> This created a second and unanticipated anomaly inside the Matrix
> which threatened to bring the system down. So in Reloaded the Oracle
> told Neo he had to find the Keymaker, and get inside the Source, which
> ultimately was the objective written into his programming, but now
> needed to happen sooner rather than later. The system needed a reboot
> to delete Smith. She gave Neo some candy to rewrite his compliance to
> this goal, and told him he'd already made the choice and now needed to
> understand it.
>
> When Neo, Trinity and Morpheus meet the Merovingian he talks about
> causality and how people can eat programs like orgasmic cake that
> force a reaction that can't be controlled, like Neo had with the
> candy. He tells Neo he's come there because he was told to be there, a
> puppet to the system. He denies Neo the Keymaker. Persephone helps Neo
> find the Keymaker, and Neo gets to the Source where he has the same
> discussion with the Architect that other Ones had before him.
>
> However, this time The One does not rejoin the source code to reset
> the system. This time, his adult love is stronger than the compliance
> and causality code he'd been given. So instead of losing himself to
> save everyone in the Matrix - as past Ones had done - he saves Trinity
> from falling to her death, and restarts the code governing her heart.
> His consciousness is now more Program than human, living in a human
> body. Agent Smith was also a Program that had overwritten a human's
> code (Bane's) to upload into the real world and possess Bane's human
> body.
>
> Neo and Smith are the same; one positive, one negative; one good, one
> evil. The Oracle says it clearly in Revolutions: Smith is the result
> of the anomaly trying to balance itself.
>
> Neo's choice to save Trinity has changed everything. The system is
> still threatened by Smith's behavior, so the Oracle makes a new
> choice; one she has never done before because no version of The One
> has ever chosen the difficult path as opposed to easy one of just
> resetting the system. She allows herself to become merged with Smith
> in the hope that she'll be able to help Neo when the time is right.
> His choices being different to the program she fed Neo have made a
> believer out of her. Neo is stronger than his programming. He is
> really The One: self-aware and self-governing - a true god in machine
> terms.
>
> At the end of their final battle, Smith tells Neo what the Oracle last
> told Neo: "everything that has a beginning has an end." This was the
> Oracle speaking to Neo through Smith, which Smith realizes because
> these aren't his words. When Smith replicated over the Oracle to see
> with her eyes, she fed him a vision of the future that was what he
> wanted to see, right down to what he would do, where he would stand
> and what he would say. Neo realizes the only way to end this is to
> sacrifice himself. He allows Smith to replicate onto him, thus
> destroying The One's program. Since Smith and The One are opposites,
> their merger cancels the other out, which is why all the Smiths simply
> delete.
>
> The Architect then reboots to start the Seventh Matrix. This time
> there is an agreement for peace. There will be no reduction of Zion
> down to 24 people. Everyone will live. The Architect tells the
> rebooted Oracle that the machines will keep their peace. But he
> suspects the humans will not. The Oracle suggests Neo or another One
> will return.
>
> I have a suspicion that because Neo's consciousness became more
> Program than human, even though his real world body died, his essence
> will be loaded into the Matrix as a Program. I think that Persephone
> was also a previous One now loaded into the Matrix. As a program not
> connected with a jacked-in human body, she remembers her mortal life,
> but can no longer experience the physicality, which is why she wanted

> fate will be the same as hers, which is why she tells Neo and Trinity
> that nothing lasts forever. When a One completes their mission and

> Oracle and the Architect, chaos and order, yin and yang, mom and dad.
>
> The post-mortal Ones are therefore the children of the Matrix gods. In
> mythology, Persephone was the beautiful daughter of Zeus (= the
> Architect) and Demeter, goddess of fertility (aka creation, intuition
> = the Oracle). Persephone was abducted by Hades and taken to his
> underground kingdom to be his wife. In the Matrix mythos, the
> Merovingian is Hades, his underground night club is Club Hel.
>
> The Merovingian is not a previous One, but he has survived Neo's
> predecessors and will also survive Neo. Merve is a Program that
> traffics information, a router. He surrounds himself with bodyguards
> and henchmen drawn out of the programs used to make movies and TV
> shows for the people plugged into the Matrix - he uses werewolves (the
> silver bullet killed him) and ghosts (the phase-shifting Twins) -
> because they cannot die inside the Matrix as easily as "normal"
> characters can. He keeps the Keymaster because he wants all the keys
> for all the backdoors in the Matrix. This is power. He also wants the
> Oracle's eyes to gain more power.

> The Matrix has many cinematic influences. Its action scenes, with a
> physics-defying style drawn directly from martial arts films, and the
> rooftop chase from classic American movies, are notable.
>
> Additionally, there are notable influences from Japanese animation
> ([anime](http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime)). Both a scene almost at
> the end of the movie, where Neo's breathing seems to buckle the fabric
> of reality in a corridor he is standing in, as well as the "psychic
> children" scene in the Oracle 's waiting room are evocative of similar
> scenes from the 1980s anime classic
> [Akira](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094625/). The title sequence, the
> rooftop chase scene where an agent breaks a concrete tile on the roof
> when landing after a jump, the scene late in the movie where a
> character hides behind a column while pieces of it are blown away by
> bullets, and a chase scene in a fruit market where shots hit
