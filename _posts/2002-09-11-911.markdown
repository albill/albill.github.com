I'm not going to talk about 9/11 much at all today. I think the media is
focusing on it enough, perhaps even too much. I still react emotionally
when thinking about it too intensely. While that isn't necessarily bad,
it isn't something that I need on my way to work or at work when I have
to focus on other things.
