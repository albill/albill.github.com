I found this on <a href="http://feeds.wired.com/~r/wiredbeyond/~3/41446750/overheard_at_id.html">Bruce Sterling's blog</a> today. It is a quote from the IDEA2006 conference, overheard:
<blockquote>"People spend whole days of their lives on the phone, dealing with billings... It's just an incredibly arduous experience."</blockquote>
I apologize to one and all for being arduous...
