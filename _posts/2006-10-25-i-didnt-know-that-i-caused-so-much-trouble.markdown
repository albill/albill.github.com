I found this on [Bruce Sterling's
blog](http://feeds.wired.com/~r/wiredbeyond/~3/41446750/overheard_at_id.html)
today. It is a quote from the IDEA2006 conference, overheard:

> "People spend whole days of their lives on the phone, dealing with
> billings... It's just an incredibly arduous experience."

I apologize to one and all for being arduous...
