This was sent out on an e-mail list that I am on with other meditators. This is an article published in July, 2006 on recent research.

<h2>Studies of Advanced Stages of Meditation in the Tibetan Buddhist and Vedic Traditions.
I: A Comparison of General Changes</h2>
<strong> Alex Hankey </strong>Hethe House, Cowden  Edenbridge, Kent TN8 7DZ, UK

This article is the first of two comparing findings of studies<sup> </sup>of advanced practitioners of Tibetan Buddhist meditation in<sup> </sup>remote regions of the Himalayas, with established results on<sup> </sup>long-term practitioners of the Transcendental Meditation programs.<sup> </sup>Many parallel levels of improvement were found, in sensory acuity,<sup> </sup>perceptual style and cognitive function, indicating stabilization<sup> </sup>of aspects of attentional awareness. Together with observed<sup> </sup>increases in EEG coherence and aspects of brain function, such<sup> </sup>changes are consistent with growth towards a state of total<sup> </sup>brain functioning, i.e. development of full mental potential.<sup> </sup>They are usually accompanied by improved health parameters.<sup> </sup>How they may be seen to be consistent with growth of enlightenment<sup> </sup>will be the subject of a second article.</blockquote>
The full text is <a href="http://ecam.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/3/4/513?etoc">online</a>. Some of the results from this have been reported earlier this year but I had not seen this full article before now.
