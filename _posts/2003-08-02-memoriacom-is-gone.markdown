I still own the domain but memoria.com is no more. I just set up the
mail server to discard all mail going to any address at memoria.com.
E-mail to my old address of memoria@memoria.com will get a reminder that
I'm at eightwinds.org but it doesn't give my new address of
boreas@eightwinds.org. The hundreds of spam messages that I won't have
to deal with will make it all worthwhile. On another note, I set up a
[PmWiki](http://www.pmichaud.com/wiki/PmWiki/PmWiki) on Ogdoadic.com as
an experiment. I won't link to it yet but if I can get the group
management to it, I may move much of my sites over to it.
