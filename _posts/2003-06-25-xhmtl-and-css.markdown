I've seen a lot of hub-bub recently about using XHTML instead of older
style HTML and also in doing layout with it using CSS2 so as to truly
separate presentation from content. Now, I know HTML pretty well and
basic CSS but all of my books and knowledge are years old for the most
part. Does anyone know of good books on XHTML and using the full set of
CSS2 formatting?
