From the [Vortex Egg

Practitioners understand ‘‘meditation,’’ or mental training, to be a
process of familiarization with one’s own mental life leading to
long-lasting changes in cognition and emotion. Little is known about
this process and its impact on the brain. Here we find that long-term
Buddhist practitioners self-induce sustained electroencephalographic
high-amplitude gamma-band oscillations and phase-synchrony during
meditation. These electroencephalogram patterns differ from those of
controls, in particular over lateral frontoparietal electrodes. In
addition, the ratio of gamma-band activity (25–42 Hz) to slow
oscillatory activity (4–13 Hz) is initially higher in the resting
baseline before meditation for the practitioners than the controls over
medial frontoparietal electrodes. This difference increases sharply
during meditation over most of the scalp electrodes and remains higher
than the initial baseline in the postmeditation baseline. These data
suggest that mental training involves temporal integrative mechanisms
and may induce shortterm and long-term neural changes.
