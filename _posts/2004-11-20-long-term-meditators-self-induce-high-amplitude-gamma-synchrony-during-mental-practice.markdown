Vortex Egg blog:</a></p>
<p>Practitioners understand ‘‘meditation,’’ or mental training, to be a process 
of familiarization with one’s own mental life leading to long-lasting changes in 
cognition and emotion. Little is known about this process and its impact on the 
brain. Here we find that long-term Buddhist practitioners self-induce sustained 
electroencephalographic high-amplitude gamma-band oscillations and 
phase-synchrony during meditation. These electroencephalogram patterns differ 
from those of controls, in particular over lateral frontoparietal electrodes. In 
addition, the ratio of gamma-band activity (25–42 Hz) to slow oscillatory 
activity (4–13 Hz) is initially higher in the resting baseline before meditation 
for the practitioners than the controls over medial frontoparietal electrodes. 
This difference increases sharply during meditation over most of the scalp 
electrodes and remains higher than the initial baseline in the postmeditation 
baseline. These data suggest that mental training involves temporal integrative 
mechanisms and may induce shortterm and long-term neural changes.</p>
