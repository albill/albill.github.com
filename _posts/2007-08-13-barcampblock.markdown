A number of us at Mozilla will be attending
[BarCampBlock](http://barcamp.org/BarCampBlock) this weekend.
BarCampBlock is an example of the BarCamp series of unconferences. You
can find information on a number of these occurring all over the world
on the [BarCamp website](http://www.barcamp.org). The [session
list](http://barcamp.org/BarCampBlockSessions) is looking pretty
interesting so far. So far I'm planning on attending the following ones
for sure:

-   Online communities, open source and the gift economy
-   A web app for the whole family -- How to legally engage kids and
    youths (under the age of 13).
-   Dialogue TV -- How to bring "Conversation Cafe" style dialogues to
    the web (podcast or video)

Mozilla is also proud to be one of the sponsors of BarCampBlock as well.
Personally, I think these kinds of events are where a lot of the
interesting ideas people have in their heads around the web, open
source, and communication percolate out. I hope to see at least a few
members of the Mozilla community there. I've heard that the event is
expecting at least 400 people and that it may go as high as 800. Not bad
for a very loosely configured event on relatively short notice (at least
for most of us).
