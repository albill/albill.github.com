Robert Aitken Roshi died last night. He was 93 years old. This is a sad moment for American Zen.

Here is the <a href="http://robertaitken.blogspot.com/2010/08/goodbye-dad-grandfather-papa-friend.html">official notice</a> from his blog.

James Ford wrote a <a href="http://www.shambhalasun.com/sunspace/?p=17949">wonderful post</a> on Aitken Roshi reflecting on his history and impact.

Aitken Roshi, through his books and example, has had a profound effect on my perception of Zen and my desire to practice this path. He has been one of the stalwart examples of an ethical teacher that, as far a I can tell, lived up to the principles of our faith. His writings were and are incredibly inspirational to me.

I believe he will be remembered as one of our most important Western teachers of the 20th and early 21st centuries.

<a href="http://zendirtzendust.com/2010/08/06/aitken-roshi-passes-away-at-93-pass-the-marmalade/">Jack Daw</a> posted the following quote from Aitken Roshi's book, “Miniatures of a Zen Master”:

<blockquote>&quot;Old age ain’t no place for sissies.  Yes, that’s true.  One must cope with a range of afflictions  from incontinence to macular degeneration, not to mention peripheral neuropathy, strokes and cancer – and memory loss!  Yet I don’t mourn my loss youth.  What a confused mess I was! What time I wasted!  All in all, I am really quite comfortable in these last years. Pass the marmalade.&quot;</blockquote>
