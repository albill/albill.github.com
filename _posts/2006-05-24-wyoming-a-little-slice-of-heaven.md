I went dark suddenly because we've been packing up the house to move. We made it back from Portland this weekend on Sunday afternoon. I flew to Wyoming on Monday morning.

I'm in Upton, Wyoming right now, which is 54 miles from Gillette, the closest real city. Local population is 872. There is no cell phone tower so to even do calling based on roaming, I have to drive three miles outside of town on the highway. Needless to say, there is no Internet at my motel.

I found out just now that I can use the computer for 30 minutes a day at the library, which is only open from 12:30 to 5:30 on weekdays. That is what I am doing now.

The country is actually quite beautiful here. It is very green right now and we had a couple of days of thunderstorms. It is in the 70's here. I'm cleaning out my dad's personal stuff in the apartment in the back of the storefront he owned right on the main street. I haven't seen any of my relatives yet except for the few that work at the local diner.

More later...perhaps. I'm back on Tuesday.
