> Since **Nescafe** were nice enough to send me free coffee samples, I
> shall review their coffees. Starting with the packaging - the samples
> arrived in a nasty white cardboard box with a "**The Nescafe
> Collection**" logo which was presumably designed to look a bit '**old
> world**', being gold, red and brown against white. It's fairly nasty,
> and also "**sealed for authenticity**", implying that if they didn't
> seal it then their rivals would capture the boxes in transit and
> replace the coffee inside with some other brand of coffee, or even
> tea. Inside the nasty white box, however, were three rather attractive
> black screw-cap test-tubes, numbered one to three. A key on the inside
> of the box, in the form of jar pictures with the same numbers and
> colours as the tubes, as well as the tubes themselves, informed me
> that these were "1. Kenjara - silky, delicate, lively", "2. Cap
> Colombie - smooth, aromatic, velvety" and "3. Alta Rica - deep, bold,
> vibrant". Unfortunately, the test tubes aren't actually full of coffee
> granules, but rather each contains two skinny little sachets of coffee
> granules. Not even well-designed easy-to-open sachets, but rather,
> sachets that require either scissors or **violent gnashing teeth** to
> open. And just six cups of coffee - hardly worth getting, even free,
> unless they were supplied with a handy servant to make the coffee and
> bring it to you at your computer. Which they weren't. On to the
> coffees themselves. **1. Kenjara** - this one is supposed to be
> 'silky, delicate and lively'. For the uninitiated, this means "really
> weak". It's silky in that it tastes like a piece of silk fabric,
> perhaps. Delicate is fairly self-explanatory. I have no idea what
> their basis for claiming 'lively' might be. It's certainly not a typo
> of 'lovely', since this coffee is not. Imagine, if you will, a person
> drinking a really nice cup of coffee. Now imagine that ten minutes
> after they finish drinking their nice cup of coffee, someone brings
> them a cup of boiling water. They spit in the water. That water with
> coffee-drinker spit in it is approximately the same as a cup of
> Kenjara. **2. Cap Colombie** - this one is supposed to be smooth,
> aromatic and velvety. Actually, I can't knock this one - as instant
> coffee goes it's pretty good. Smooth and aromatic are fair
> descriptions, and for bonus points it actually doesn't taste like
> velvet, nor leave crumbling fluff in your mouth like a piece of velvet
> would. I'd rather have proper percolated, machined or pressed coffee,
> enough so that I'd make the greater effort to have it rather than
> instant, but for the portable convenience of an instant, I'd choose
> this over most plain coffees. On the other hand, I'd rather have a
> vanilla-tainted instant coffee anyway. It's almost a shame I like this
> one, since it means I don't get to say "Cap Colombie? Crap Columbie,
> more like!" Except just then. **3. Alta Rica** - this one's supposed
> to be deep, bold and vibrant. Deep in the Lovecraftian sense of "Deep
> One", it tastes as I imagine it would taste if one set fire to an
> amphibian, let it burn itself out, and then put it through a blender.
> Bold is a special code word for "drink it while it's still boiling so
> you don't have to taste it". I have a theory about the existence of
> this coffee - I think what Nescafe do is roast large masses of beans,
> then run all the beans along a conveyor belt. There, robots sort the
> beans into "somehow not actually cooked at all", used for Kenjara,
> "nicely roasted", used for Cap Columbie, and "**entirely
> carbonised**", used for Alta Rica. Rather than buying a jar of Alta
> Rica, simply burn a phone book, and sprinkle the ashes into a cup of
> hot water. Add some frog urine for the vaunted authenticity.
