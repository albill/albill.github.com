[FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:](http://billboardliberation.com/HQ.html)\
\
February 27, 2008\
San Francisco, CA\
\
The Billboard Liberation Front today announced a major new advertising
improvement campaign executed on behalf of clients AT&T and the National
Security Agency. Focusing on billboards in the San Francisco area, this
improvement action is designed to promote and celebrate the innovative
collaboration of these two global communications giants.\
\
“This campaign is an extraordinary rendition of a public-private
partnership,” observed BLF spokesperson Blank DeCoverly. “These two
titans of telecom have a long and intimate relationship, dating back to
the age of the telegraph. In these dark days of Terrorism, that should
be a comfort to every law-abiding citizen with nothing to hide.”\
\
AT&T initially downplayed its heroic efforts in the War on Terror,
preferring to serve in silence behind the scenes. “But then we realized
we had a PR win on our hands,” noted AT&T V.P. of Homeland Security
James Croppy. “Not only were we helping NSA cut through the cumbersome
red tape of the FISA system, we were also helping our customers by
handing over their e-mails and phone records to the government. Modern
life is so hectic – who has time to cc the feds on every message? It’s a
great example of how we anticipate our customers’ needs and act on them.
And, it should be pointed out, we offered this service free of charge.”\
\
Commenting on the action, and responding to questions about pending
privacy litigation and the stalled Congressional effort to shield the
telecoms from these lawsuits, NSA spokesperson [REDACTED] remarked:
“[REDACTED] we [REDACTED] condone [REDACTED] warrantless [REDACTED],
[REDACTED] SIGINT intercepts, [REDACTED] torture [REDACTED] information
retrieval by [REDACTED] means necessary.”\
\
“It’s a win-win-win situation,” noted the BLF’s DeCoverly. “NSA gets the
data it needs to keep America safe, telecom customers get free services,
and AT&T makes a fortune. That kind of cooperation between the public
and private sectors should serve as a model to all of us, and a
harbinger of things to come.”\

Come see the improvement at 14th St. and Valencia St. in San Francisco\
\
The BLF (www.billboardliberation.com) has been improving outdoor
advertising since 1977. Prior campaigns have included work for Exxon,
R.J. Reynolds, and Apple Computers.\
\
AT&T (www.att.com) is America’s favorite telecommunications trust. Based
in San Antonio, Texas, it has over 300,000 employees and annual revenues
of $117 Billion.\
\
NSA (www.nsa.gov) is the largest intelligence organization in the world.
Headquartered at Fort Meade, Maryland, its budget, personnel, products,
and services are all classified.\
