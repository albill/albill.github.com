Why do I find myself in these positions of being webmaster to non-profits and other groups? I just volunteered to fill the webmaster position on the Pema Kilaya steering committee. There is only one other geek in the group (and he&apos;s an uberengineer geek) but he&apos;s flat out said that while he&apos;ll develop web apps and such for the group, he isn&apos;t to be considered reliable for doing website work. He doesn&apos;t want the job.
