Why do I find myself in these positions of being webmaster to
non-profits and other groups? I just volunteered to fill the webmaster
position on the Pema Kilaya steering committee. There is only one other
geek in the group (and he's an uberengineer geek) but he's flat out said
that while he'll develop web apps and such for the group, he isn't to be
considered reliable for doing website work. He doesn't want the job.
