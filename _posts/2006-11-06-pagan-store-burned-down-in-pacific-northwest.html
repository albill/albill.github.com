The local pagan bookstore in Everett, Washington burned down recently. It is suspected that it may be arson.

This was covered in the <a href="http://heraldnet.com/stories/06/11/06/100loc_b1fire001.cfm">local newspaper</a>.

Everett is the next major city north of Seattle and I expect that I know people that go to this store on a regular basis. I do hope that if it is arson that they catch the person that did this. It is a shame, to say the least.
