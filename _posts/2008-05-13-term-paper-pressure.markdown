The process of writing a term paper is always painful in a way. You're
writing a paper for a class in which you wish to get a good grade and
the paper is almost always at least 50% of the grade (75% in my case).
That's a little pressure. In my case, you can add to this pressure the
fact that the class is taught by a professor that you admire and whom
you'd like to be your dissertation advisor (if you are even accepted
into the doctoral program). If I completely screw this paper up, it
isn't going to make a good impression on him and if I don't work with
this professor, I'm unlikely to be accepted into the doctoral program
with my areas of interest (there are only a few people in the entire
country who specialize in Japanese esoteric Buddhism, most are only
vaguely aware of its existence). So, it had better be a good paper, eh?
I've spent my third or so day in a row pouring over the history
**around** the *Mahavairocana Sutra* and the *Susiddhikara Sutra*
(apparently, it doesn't work to call them the "Mahavairocana and
Susiddhikara Sutras" collectively). I have about eight pages of
double-spaced text and 33 (!) footnotes, documenting statements. This
outlines the purpose of my paper (about two pages) and the history of
these two texts, their travels and translation in China, and how they
wound up being connected to Shingon and Tendai. At this point, the next
week and a half or so will be going back and forth through these two
texts, summarizing the ritual content in general terms and some
specifics, and then comparing this ritual content between the text. Even
my professor, Dr. Payne, admits that I may not get a lot useful out of
it at the end but, as he wrote in all caps, "YOU CAN'T KNOW THE END OF
THE PATH UNTIL YOU WALK IT ...The very fact that you can't see where
this is leading is REALLY GOOD. If you already knew, why would you be
doing this work?" Let's see how this goes. Maybe I'll fly! If nothing
else, I have my charming career in software to focus on. I hear you can
get decent jobs at that still.
