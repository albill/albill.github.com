I've been enjoying the new Saul Williams album, “<a href="http://niggytardust.com/">The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of Niggy Tardust!</a>“, that I <a href="http://www.arcanology.com/2007/11/01/saul-williams-niggytardust-album-for-download/">blogged about the other day</a>. It's a great album and I'm glad that I actually paid money for it to support his work as an artist. I did want to share the original work that grabbed Trent Reznor's attention and caused him to seek out Saul Williams in order to work with him. The song is "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1llNYAlYrc">List of Demands</a>" and I've posted the video of it below. <lj-embed></lj-embed> Good music!
