by W.S. Merwin<br><br>When the forests have been destroyed their darkness remains<br>The ash the great walker follows the possessors<br>Forever<br>Nothing they will come to is real<br>Not for long<br>Over the watercourses<br>Like ducks in the time of ducks<br>The ghosts of the villages trail in the sky<br>Making a new twilight<br>
<br>Rain falls into the open eyes of the dead<br>Again again with its pointless sound<br>When the moon finds them they are the color of everything.<br>
<br>The nights disappear like bruises but nothing is healed<br>the dead go away like bruises<br>The blood vanishes into the poisoned farmlands<br>Pain the horizon<br>Remains<br>Overhead the seasons rock<br>They are paper bells<br>Calling to nothing living<br>
<br>The possessors move everywhere under Death their star<br>Like columns of smoke they advance into the shadows<br>Like thin flames with no light<br>They with no past<br>And fire their only future</p>
