So, two days ago, there was no one else offering on the house that we want. Yesterday, we decided to make an offer. When we got together with our agent in the evening, he found out that another offer was in the works. We sweetened our offer a small amount and we&apos;re pre-approved for the loan amount so we&apos;ll see. Our agent was supposed to submit our offer a couple of hours ago but the seller&apos;s agent says that the seller wants to review the offers herself. She and her agent are meeting this evening. So, <b>perhaps</b>, later tonight we&apos;ll know if they accepted our offer or not. We decided that we aren&apos;t going to go up much in price though. There are plenty of houses available right now so we&apos;ll look for another if it comes to that.
