A Mr. Boffo cartoon:

Mr. Boffo and (Ace) Weederman, the Wonder-Dog, are sitting on a deserted island in the middle of the ocean. Mr. Boffo is saying:

"Someday, Weederman, we'll look back on all this and laugh.

"It will probably be one of those deep, eerie ones that slowly build to a blood-curdling maniacal scream...but still it will be a laugh."
