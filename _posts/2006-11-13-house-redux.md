The sellers caved when we decided to back out of the house detail because they wouldn't pay for half of the foundation work for the brick porch. Their realtor told ours to wait when we offered the papers to cancel the contract and she called back about two hours later saying that they had accepted.

So, in early December, we will be the owners of a small three bedroom, single floor, Arts and Crafts house on the Berkeley/Oakland/Emeryville border area. I will live about a mile from my current job and a little less than a mile from the closest BART station.

What a weird day.
