I'm going to Madison, Wisconsin at the end of January now. I hadn't  originally planned on attending this but an old friend of mine that I  reconnected with last year is also involved in Dzogchen and Vajrayana. Younge  Khachab Rinpoche is now his primary teacher and he's been telling me a lot of  excellent things about him. Apparantly, he's quite the scholar and he's very  open to teaching Dzogchen and related practices to sincere practitioners without  being ultraorthodox like some teachers are notorious for being. That isn't to  say he's out in the weeds but that his focus is on practice and in working with  people. One of the fundamental things I've been looking for in my involvement  with Tibetan Buddhism is a teacher that I can make a personal connection with  and actually get to work with individually.

To this end, my friend, William, who is in New Mexico, and I will be going  out to Madison together. He's going to introduce me to Rinpoche so I can have an  interview with him and attend some teachings to see his style and way of doing  things. If all goes well, I'll go out for a May Dzogchen retreat there as well  and I'll be working with Rinpoche and his Madison group to bring him to Seattle  to teach. If all goes well, I'll volunteer to host him and organize the retreat.  William feels that Rinpoche is in the kind of position with his students that  Norbu was 15  or 20 years ago when there were only a few people so it was  possible to get a lot more hands on time with the lama.

The Younge Dorje Drollo is a complete Three Roots (Tsa-Sum) practice with  Lama, Yidam and Khandro contained in the mantra and visualizations. The outer  practice focuses on the Five Family Buddhas and Consorts. This famous practice  was discovered by the Terton Younge Migyur Dorje.

This is one of the most powerful practices for removing negative obstacles in  one's life, particularly important for entering the New Year and multiplying the  positive attributes for success in dharma practice.

Khachab Rinpoche is renowned for his success in dream yoga practices. He is  often called by other Lamas and teachers for predictions and interpretations.  Dream interpretation can be tricky, what may seem positive or an omen to ones  practice is often the sign of an inner interruption or spiritual obstacle. If  one does not recognize the dream and its signs, one can very easily perpetuate  the negative forces. Rinpoche teaches the yogic technique of recognizing our  clear-light mind during sleep, learning to maintain our awareness through the  dreaming process and interpreting the appearances that occur.
