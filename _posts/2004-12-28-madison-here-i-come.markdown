I'm going to Madison, Wisconsin at the end of January now. I hadn't
originally planned on attending this but an old friend of mine that I
reconnected with last year is also involved in Dzogchen and Vajrayana.
Younge Khachab Rinpoche is now his primary teacher and he's been telling
me a lot of excellent things about him. Apparantly, he's quite the
scholar and he's very open to teaching Dzogchen and related practices to
sincere practitioners without being ultraorthodox like some teachers are
notorious for being. That isn't to say he's out in the weeds but that
his focus is on practice and in working with people. One of the
fundamental things I've been looking for in my involvement with Tibetan
Buddhism is a teacher that I can make a personal connection with and
actually get to work with individually. To this end, my friend, William,
who is in New Mexico, and I will be going out to Madison together. He's
going to introduce me to Rinpoche so I can have an interview with him
and attend some teachings to see his style and way of doing things. If
all goes well, I'll go out for a May Dzogchen retreat there as well and
I'll be working with Rinpoche and his Madison group to bring him to
Seattle to teach. If all goes well, I'll volunteer to host him and
organize the retreat. William feels that Rinpoche is in the kind of
position with his students that Norbu was 15 or 20 years ago when there
were only a few people so it was possible to get a lot more hands on
time with the lama.

## Younge Khachab Rinpoche

## Winter Retreat Teachings 2005

-   Younge Dorje Drollo Empowerment
-   Dream Yoga Instruction
-   Tibetan Dream Interpretation

January 28-30th

### [Rime Shedrub Ling](http://www.rimeshedrubling.org/) Tibetan
Buddhist Meditation and Teaching Center Madison, WI

The Younge Dorje Drollo is a complete Three Roots (Tsa-Sum) practice
with Lama, Yidam and Khandro contained in the mantra and visualizations.
The outer practice focuses on the Five Family Buddhas and Consorts. This
famous practice was discovered by the Terton Younge Migyur Dorje. This
is one of the most powerful practices for removing negative obstacles in
one's life, particularly important for entering the New Year and
multiplying the positive attributes for success in dharma practice.
Khachab Rinpoche is renowned for his success in dream yoga practices. He
is often called by other Lamas and teachers for predictions and
interpretations. Dream interpretation can be tricky, what may seem
positive or an omen to ones practice is often the sign of an inner
interruption or spiritual obstacle. If one does not recognize the dream
and its signs, one can very easily perpetuate the negative forces.
Rinpoche teaches the yogic technique of recognizing our clear-light mind
during sleep, learning to maintain our awareness through the dreaming
process and interpreting the appearances that occur. Teachings held at:
715 Hill St. Quarry Arts Building Room 170 (East of Whole Foods off
University Ave.) Madison Wisconsin Friday 5-8pm Dream Yoga Instruction
Saturday 9-12 and 2-4pm Dorje Drollo Empowerment and Instruction Sunday
