In many ways, Buddhism seems to be a natural path for institutionalized
prisoners who make the decision to grow spiritually while incarcerated.
With training and some instruction on a regular basis, most inmates
should have the time and space for a meditation practice (or other forms
of contemplation). When I volunteered to work with Wiccan inmates at a
Washington state prison in the past, almost all of the inmates had
chosen their path **after** they were incarcerated. I expect that this
is true for most followers of non-mainstream (which, in America, means
non-Christian or Jewish) faiths. I haven't seen figures to really back
this but this is what my Colbertian gut tells me. The environment in a
prison is, frankly, horrid. I doubt anyone reading this would be
surprised to learn that. The reality of what I saw, at a medium security
facility, was both better and worse than what the media portrays, which
is often a vision of maximum security prisons. That said, spending time
in a prison was probably the greatest motivator that I've ever seen to
not want to be incarcerated. This harsh prison environment has a
corrosive effect on people in a variety of ways. The loss of control of
anything to do with one's self and of basic human dignity is toxic to
people, who seem to respond in a variety of ways. That being case, this
very harshness may also act as a motivator to practice and deal with
one's life, at least on a mental level. An inmate has nothing but time
on their hands, often many years of it. The biggest barrier to prison
practice that I can see is a lack of training and resources. Inmates, by
and large, do not come from the most educated end of society (though
there are really obvious exceptions) and lack exposure to spirituality
oftentimes except in the most basic of ways. Those that find an urge to
develop spiritually may have come to this on their own or, if they are
lucky, through exposure to some sort of practice group in prison. Some
may have access to a library with a decent range of books (but this is
pretty unlikely in many instances). If someone does have an urge to
study Buddhism, he or she is not going to know where to start. There
really does need to be both a supportive sangha, both inside and outside
of a facility, to help people and to reinforce their path. Along with
this, inmates need access to both training, in the form of a teacher,
and materials to study. For most practicing spiritual groups in a
prison, an outside person may only come in once a month or, at most,
once a week. The rest of the time, the prisoners are on their own. In
many facilities, they cannot even meet as a group without an outside
facilitator present. This was the case of the group of people that I
worked with years ago in a Wiccan context. This weights things in the
favor of Christianity in most institutions since, if they have a
chaplain present, the chaplain will almost always be a Christian.
Additionally, chaplains have great discretion in what happens with
spiritual organizations in a facility (almost dictatorial powers, in
fact) and, all too often, are sometimes hostile to non-Christian faiths.
This means that inmates can often only meet if an outsider is present
and, otherwise, they must practice alone or, if they are lucky enough to
have a cellmate or compatriot in the same part of a facility, in a very
small group. This makes it all the more important that inmates are given
the tools necessary to practice when unsupervised or alone and the
support on the occasions when someone does come in from outside. During
the times outside of group meetings, study is possible but materials
must be made available. Generally, these must be sponsored by an
individual or group outside of a facility and can only be brought into a
prison with the approval of the chaplain and other authorities (for
obvious reasons, material flowing into and out of a prison is pretty
controlled). Since becoming an active Buddhist, I have no participated
in prison work but it is something that I often think about doing. I can
honestly say that I think about it with some uneasiness at times because
the circumstances (and sometimes the system and individuals) can be so
difficult and emotionally challenging. That being said, it is work that
is necessary, especially in the United States where we incarcerate so
much of our population. I know of a number of Buddhist prison programs
that stand out:

1.  The [Prison Dharma Network](http://www.prisondharmanetwork.org/)
2.  The [Transformative
    Justice](http://www.bpf.org/html/current_projects/prison_program/prison_program.html)
    program of the [Buddhist Peace
    Fellowship](http://www.bpf.org/html/home.html). (Zen)
3.  The [National Buddhist Prison
    Sangha](http://www.mro.org/zmmold/rightaction/nbps.html) of [Zen
    Mountain Monastery](http://www.mro.org) (Zen)
4.  The [Prison Outreach
    Program](http://www.upaya.org/action/prisonprogram.php) of [Upaya
    Institute and Zen Center](http://www.upaya.org/index.php) (Zen)
5.  The [Engaged Zen Foundation](http://engaged-zen.org/) (whose entire
    work is prison focused) (Zen)
6.  The [Shambhala Prison
    Community](http://www.shambhalaprisoncommunity.org/) (Shambhala)
7.  The [Prison program](http://www.amritaseattle.org/Prison.htm) of
    [Chagdud Gonpa Amrita](http://www.amritaseattle.org) (Tibetan
    Buddhism) in my home town of Seattle - This is small in size but
    I've heard about it for a while now.
8.  [Vipassana Meditation Courses](http://www.prison.dhamma.org/) from
    the teachings of S.N. Goenka (Theravadan)
9.  The [Mind Body Awareness
    Project](http://www.mbaproject.org/index.php?c=About) - This
    organization focuses on youths and teaches both meditation and yoga
    techniques.

The Prison Dharma Network has published the wonderful book, [**Sitting
Inside**](http://www.amazon.com/Sitting-Inside-Buddhist-Practice-Americas/dp/0971814309/),
on Dharma practice in prisons. As you can see, most of these programs in
the United States are run by Zen groups. I'm not sure why this is except
that Zen is fairly well established and is focused on a relatively
specific sort of meditation practice (as is Vipassana meditation as
taught by S.N. Goenka and his followers). There has actually been a bit
of media focus on Vipassana in prisons. There was a video made in the
mid-90s about the introduction of Vipassana meditation into an Indian
prison called, **[Doing Time, Doing
Vipassana](http://www.dhamma.org/en/av/dtdv.shtml)**. You can actually
watch this online (and I've embedded the first section below). There was
actually a movie made about a Vipassana meditation retreat done within
an American prison in the South with maximum security prisoners. This
movie is **[The Dhamma Brothers](http://www.dhammabrothers.com/)**. You
can read an [article in the New York
Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/13/movies/13dhar.html) about it
and see the [trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pwkCSSnZA)
embedded below as well. I hope that reading this post encourages fellow
Buddhists to think about prisoners, working with prisoners, and the
potential role of the Dharma in prisons.
