Well, there went the hope of a relaxing evening.

Phone call on my cell:
<blockquote>"Hello?""Hi Al, this is Patrick." (my apartment manager)

"Hi, Patrick. Whassup?"

"I listed your apartment in the newspaper. It's in late so it won't show up until the Sunday edition. I expect that I'll need to show it a few times on Sunday or Monday. We'll just come in, look around for a few and leave..."

<em>Al looks around at mounds of books, papers, coffee cups, cat hair, cats, dirty clothes, etc. etc. etc.</em>

"Uhm, Ok. Thanks for letting me know."

"Sure thing. Talk to you later."

"Bye"</blockquote>
I guess I'm packing shit in boxes tonight for my move and making my place into a not-complete-pig-sty. I haven't let the manager into my apartment since I rented it 1 year, 11 months ago. He's <strong>never</strong> been inside. heh.

P.S. "Bemused" is not a mood. It should be.
