I just heard from my wife and them from a bunch of freemasons that Cardinal Ratzinger is now Pope Benedict XVI.

You can kiss any hope of reform in the Roman Catholic Church goodbye. No ordination of women. No removal of the vow of celibacy (only 1,000 years old). No advancement of any other reforms.

As someone who grew up catholic, it is kind of sad to see these kinds of things happen when they could do so much better.
