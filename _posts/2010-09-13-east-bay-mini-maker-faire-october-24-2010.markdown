Chris Hecker, here in the East Bay area, wrote about a local Mini Maker
Faire. He says:

There is a [decent blog
post](http://ebmakerfaire.wordpress.com/2010/05/30/the-start-of-something-mini/)
about the origin of this mini event on their blog. [Ace Monster
Toys](http://acemonstertoys.org/display/AMT/Home), the East Bay
hackerspace, has a proposal in discussion for the event and I know that
many of us plan to attend since it is in our back yard. I encourage
others to go as well.
