I finished the **Claw of the Conciliator** by Gene Wolfe last night.
That's the second of his **Book of the New Son** series (of four). After
I read these four, I'm going to read **The Urth of the New Sun**, then
the four **Books of the Long Sun** followed by the three **Books of the
Short Sun**. Damn, and here I thought that Frank Herbert had written the
longest series in the world with his **Dune** books. These twelve books
of Wolfe's will be my reading for a while but I am greatly enjoying
them. I read the first few as a teen but I wasn't really in a position
to enjoy them or the style of the writing at the time. Teens aren't
known for catching anything subtle (nor am I, really) but these books
have slender strands woven all through them. Luckily, a friend also lent
me his copy of the the **Lexicon Urthus**, which is a dictionary of all
of the obscure terminology that Wolfe uses throughout the series. I
generally catch the Gnosstic, Latin and Kabbalistic references but not
many of the others. The lexicon will probably be of great aid ahead.
