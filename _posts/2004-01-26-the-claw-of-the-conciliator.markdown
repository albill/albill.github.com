I finished the <strong>Claw of the Conciliator</strong> by Gene Wolfe last night. That's the second of his <strong>Book of the New Son</strong> series (of four). After I read these four, I'm going to read <strong>The Urth of the New Sun</strong>, then the four <strong>Books of the Long Sun</strong> followed by the three <strong>Books of the Short Sun</strong>. Damn, and here I thought that Frank Herbert had written the longest series in the world with his <strong>Dune</strong> books. These twelve books of Wolfe's will be my reading for a while but I am greatly enjoying them. I read the first few as a teen but I wasn't really in a position to enjoy them or the style of the writing at the time. Teens aren't known for catching anything subtle (nor am I, really) but these books have slender strands woven all through them. Luckily, a friend also lent me his copy of the the <strong>Lexicon Urthus</strong>, which is a dictionary of all of the obscure terminology that Wolfe uses throughout the series. I generally catch the Gnosstic, Latin and Kabbalistic references but not many of the others. The lexicon will probably be of great aid ahead.
