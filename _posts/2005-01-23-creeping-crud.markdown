I have been officially served notice by the Creeping Crud that it is
moving into my residence for a while. I've been feeling a bit crappy
since Friday night but I've turned the corner to **completely** crappy
"gonna have a lie down now" mode. Since I don't get sick normally at
all, this does not bode well for other humans around me, in a variety of
ways.
