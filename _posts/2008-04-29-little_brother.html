I've been waiting to read <a href="http://www.craphound.com">Cory Doctorow's</a> new book, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Little-Brother-Cory-Doctorow/dp/0765319853">Little Brother</a></strong>, since I first heard him talk about it. He did a reading from it last year at <strong><a href="http://www.sfinsf.org/">SF in SF</a></strong>, a local Science Fiction salon (who are unable to provide an RSS feed for events...). 

The official description of the book is:
<blockquote>Marcus, a.k.a “w1n5t0n,” is only seventeen years old, but he figures he already knows how the system works–and how to work the system. Smart, fast, and wise to the ways of the networked world, he has no trouble outwitting his high school’s intrusive but clumsy surveillance systems.

But his whole world changes when he and his friends find themselves caught in the aftermath of a major terrorist attack on San Francisco. In the wrong place at the wrong time, Marcus and his crew are apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security and whisked away to a secret prison where they’re mercilessly interrogated for days.

When the DHS finally releases them, Marcus discovers that his city has become a police state where every citizen is treated like a potential terrorist. He knows that no one will believe his story, which leaves him only one option: to take down the DHS himself.</blockquote>

The afterword is written by security guru <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/">Bruce Schneier</a>. How cool is that?

Today is the official release day and, right on time, my Amazon pre-order slapped into my porch from my local mail dwarf. Check it out:

I put in a gratuitous pro-Tor picture of my personal laptop as well. (<a href="http://tor.eff.org">Tor</a> plays a role in the book, as I recall.)

I recorded Cory's reading last year, which is embedded below, if you are interested in hearing the excerpt from the book. There is a bit of an introduction from the SF in SF organizers and Cory starts at about 4 minutes and 55 seconds into the recording.
