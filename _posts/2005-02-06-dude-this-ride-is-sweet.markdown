I'm sitting in my living room listening to itunes streaming from my AMD64 box in the backroom via wireless on my new 12" Powerbook.

I've been lusting for a little apple love for a while. I was getting a mac mini but I kind of wanted a laptop instead. The clincher came when R asked me about working on my papers and such for school outside of the backroom. I, personally, don't like being back there all of the time by myself. So, I killed two birds with one stone and went ahead and got the new laptop.

I can't really justify it as it wasn't cheap but it is pretty sweet. 

OS X definitely has its odd moments but my old unix background helps a bit. I'm trying to make a list of applications that I should get in order for it to be a full featured machine. Any mac users out there should send me their hints.

Overall, as far as the user experience goes, it is pretty good. The one thing that I can't get used to, compared to my work laptop, is the one button glidepad. I'm using Firefox on it and it is normally a right click to open a link in a new tab but I have to control-click and choose from the context menu to do it. That kind of bites.
