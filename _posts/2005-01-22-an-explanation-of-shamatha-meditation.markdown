This text is illustrated with an adaptation of a traditional Buddhist diagram- an  explanatory model of stages in the development of skill in concentration (shamatha  or shine). This basic meditation technique is common to a number of meditative  traditions and an essential tool in all advanced Buddhist meditation practices.  The diagram clearly indicates that the practice of concentration involves  development of refinement of innate functions of the mind.

The first panel depicts several mental functions during the first phase of  concentration practice, when the meditator repeatedly attempts to focus  attention one-pointedly on a single object, either external or internal. The  meditator starts out on the path of well learned instructions equipped with  shackles and goad which represent short term memory and the monitoring function,  to catch and subdue the wild elephant of mind. The elephant's black color  represents under-arousal of mind, which hinders clear perception of the object  and eventually leads to drowsiness. The monkey represents distraction, and its  black color is caused by over-arousal of mind. After each failure to maintain  one-pointed attention on the object the meditator must determine whether it was  due to over- or under- arousal and take corrective measures for the next trial.  The fire, decreasing in size from the first to the seventh stages, and absent  thereafter, indicates the degree of effort required at each stage until  concentration becomes 'spontaneous'.

The second stage is achieved mainly through development of short-term working  memory and involves lengthening the period of unbroken concentration.

From the second stage on, the blackness of monkey and elephant begins to  diminish, indicating the decreasing tendency toward over- and under-arousal and  resulting in less distractibility and a clearer grasp of the object.

By  the third stage the meditator has fastened the shackle (short-term memory)  firmly to the elephant of mind but is still pulled along behind. Lacking full  control, the meditator must continue to refocus attention after each lapse.  However, the period of unbroken concentration is longer and less effort is  expending. A hare appears for the first time, symbolizing a subtle aspect of the  hindrance of over-arousal due to the effort required to establish concentration.
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/manju4.gif" style="background: #ffffff none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial" alt="Shine - Fourth Stage" border="0" height="95" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="200" /></p>
At  the fourth stage, development of the monitoring function (a goad - a sense for the  level of activity of the nervous system) and the extension of the period of  short-term memory permit finer control during concentration. The factors of  over- and under-arousal are greatly reduced both during and in-between the  actual state of absorption, as is the effort required to establish the  absorption state. At this stage normally positive mental functions will distract  the mind from the object and must be suppressed during concentration practice.  It is no longer necessary to reset the mind again, since the developed  short-term memory and the monitoring function acting together permit correction  of over- and under-arousal before losing the object.
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/manju5.gif" style="background: #ffffff none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial" alt="Shine - Fifth Stage" border="0" height="93" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="196" /></p>
By  the fifth stage the mind tends to be drawn automatically toward the object, and  thus the monitoring function itself, which tends to increase arousal and lead to  distraction, must be released. The fire of effort is small and the hare is  absent, the mind is said to be pacified.
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/manju6.gif" style="background: #ffffff none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial" alt="Shine - Sixth Stage" border="0" height="95" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="198" /></p>
At the sixth stage, the monkey of distraction has faded out, and the blackness  of mental sluggishness has almost disappeared from the elephant of mind. Only  the slightest over- or under-arousal disturbs the absorption state and this is  easily corrected with slight effort before concentration falls.
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/manju7.gif" style="background: #ffffff none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial" alt="Shine - Seventh Stage" border="0" height="147" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="197" /></p>
At  the seventh stage the monkey is completely gone, the elephant is completely white  and is untouched by distraction or sluggishness. Gone also are shackle and goad,  because short-term memory and the monitoring function are needed only to  establish the actual absorption state, which is now 'effortless'. Finally the  meditator seated and at rest, has achieved perfect mental equanimity. This is  attended by mental and physical ecstasy, the latter felt as a pleasurable  lightness symbolized by flying. The resulting perfect control on mental  functioning (riding on the elephant) serves as a basis for advanced practices  such as 'analytic Insight' (Vipassana). This again requires effort (fire) and  analytic thought (sword in the hand of Manjushri, with whom you can identify  now) firmly combined with perfect concentration. Substantial development of  concentration skill can be achieved in as little as six months with proper  condition, instructions and guidance. However, developed concentration alone  tends to degenerate unless it is applied to advanced analytic techniques as  mentioned above.
