When you watch your old tomcat walk into furniture repeatedly, it
doesn't take long to realize that maybe he can't see...

Pollux, whom most of my friends have met over the years, seems to be
blind now. He's walking around and stopping when his whiskers encounter
something. He still seems to know his way around the house so diagnosis
has been difficult. When you wave a finger about a centimeter in front
of a cat's eyeball repeatedly, you do get a definite impression that he
isn't seeing though.

I think this has happened over the last couple of weeks. We've noticed
that he's looked a bit like Puss 'n Boots in Shrek 2 recently. By this,
I mean that his eyes look very large. I realized today that it is
because his pupils seem to be dilated almost all of the way open all of
the time. I've only seen them close down a bit when he has faced into
direct sunlight. It isn't normal for a cat's eyes to be open to that
degree in normal light. That's night vision mode in my experience.

After some testing, it seems that he may be seeing some light and shadow
with at least his right eye but I'm not entirely sure. This strikes me
as possibly a good reason to take him to the vet. I don't know for sure
that this came on suddenly but it seems that way and that could mean
that there are other problems.
