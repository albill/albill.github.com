So, I'm considering going to Portland, OR the weekend of June 26 for the following event. Anyone know of any cheap or fine places to stay? :-)

<b>Dzogchen Teachings</b>
<b>with Ponlop Trinley Nyima Rinpoche</b>

Ponlop Rinpoche brings to Portland the rare opportunity to receive teachings from the ancient Bon Tradition. The weekend teaching will focus on Dzogchen, regarded by both Bon and Buddhist schools to be the highest of the spiritual teachings. All students of any level and tradition are welcome to come and deepen their understanding of Dzogchen.

Ponlop Trinley Nyima Rinpoche is a lineage holder of the Tibetan Bon tradition. Rinpoche received his Geshe degree in 1989 and has been teaching at the Menri Monastery in Dolanji, India since that time. He became Ponlop, or Chief Instructor, of the monastery in 1992. Ponlop Rinpoche is internationally known for his immense knowledge and delightful presence.
