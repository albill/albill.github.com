R and I went over to the Forest Yurt last night for Tara Puja. This is
the first meeting of the unnamed, ad-hoc circle of practitioners that
[Denny](http://www.psychicsophia.com/aion/dennybio.html) and Sophia
spoke with us about forming. It was pretty low key and we got to hang
out a bit before and after ritual. For the ritual itself, we did a
sadhana for the 21 Taras. Here is one of them. **Om Tare Tutare Svaha**!
