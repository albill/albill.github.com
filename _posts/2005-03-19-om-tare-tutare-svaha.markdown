R and I went over to the Forest Yurt last night for Tara Puja. This is the first meeting of the unnamed, ad-hoc circle of practitioners that <a href="http://www.psychicsophia.com/aion/dennybio.html">Denny</a> and Sophia spoke with us about forming. It was pretty low key and we got to hang out a bit before and after ritual. For the ritual itself, we did a sadhana for the 21 Taras.

Here is one of them. <strong>Om Tare Tutare Svaha</strong>!

By Marut and different mighty ones.
Honored by the hosts of spirits, of <em>yakshas</em>,
Of <em>gandharvas</em> and the walking dead</h2>
