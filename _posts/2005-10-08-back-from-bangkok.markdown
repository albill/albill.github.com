I'm back from Thailand and catching up on a few things, like e-mail and blogs. I'm back to work on Monday and will need to catch up on what's been going on.

I had a paper due yesterday and another one due this coming Friday but the latter is fairly short and both professors know that I was out of the country for two weeks. Neither of them seems concerned about dates but I want to try to not be more than a week late with either because there are papers every three or four weeks on average and I have to get cracking on the following ones as well. I all but finished John Stuart Mill's <strong>On Liberty</strong> for one class on the plane back. I did start and finish Dostoyesky's <strong>Notes from the Underground </strong>during the trip, which is the basis for the paper that I need to work on first. After all of this, I have B.F. Skinner, William Morris, and Virginia Woolf to be reading.

I'm working to arrange with one of my current profs, who may be the chair of my thesis committee, to do an independent study for Spring semester (which starts in January...) on the current scholastic work on Western Esotericism and methodology.

I just, a few minutes ago, finished editing and uploading all of my digital photos from the trip. I haven't tagged each photo yet but I did put an online photo album up. It's atÂ  <a href="http://www.zhangzhung.net/gallery/thailand/">http://www.zhangzhung.net/gallery/thailand/</a>.
