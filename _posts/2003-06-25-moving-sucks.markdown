I hate packing boxes. I worked on reviews for my employees much of the
day at work (I still think it is funny that not only do I manage
**other** people but that they keep giving me more of them...). Then I
went to Latin 103 for a couple of hours after doing Latin homework in a
coffeeshop. Then I came home to eat dinner finally around 9:45 pm and
now I'm supposed to be packing more. Shee-it! I'll be glad when we're
moved in this weekend. On a plus note, R and I have decided to make the
time (with some schedule games with her parents trip up here) to go to
[Twilight Gathering](http://www.twilightgathering.org) this fall. This
is the smaller, high quality, pagan event that Sam Webster and his crew
operate every fall near the Bay Area. We also recently asked Sam to
officiate at our wedding and he said that he'd be honored to do so.
We're very happy about this and will be visiting with him in a week and
a half when we're down in Berkeley visiting the future in-laws of mine.
