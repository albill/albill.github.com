![image](http://www.arcanology.com/images/firefox-box.jpg)I know that by
the time you see this, you've probably already heard but the [first beta
of Firefox 3 is now
available](http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2007/11/19/firefox-3-beta-1-now-available-for-download/).
QA just finished signing off and bits have been distributed out to
handle downloads. A huge sigh of relief is out and a new milestone has
been passed. You can get the beta through the
[article](http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2007/11/19/firefox-3-beta-1-now-available-for-download/)
above on [DevNews](http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/). The [release
notes](http://en-us.www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.0b1/releasenotes/)
for the beta are also available for those so inclined to read them. This
is pretty exciting. People have been putting a lot of work into Firefox
3 for quite a while now. I know that on the QA team, we've been running
ourselves ragged on getting issues nailed down, features tested, and
generally making sure that it will be a solid beta experience for
people. It's been a long day for QA today between getting this out the
door and putting an [update in the beta
channel](http://quality.mozilla.org/en/node/920) for Firefox 2.0.0.10
release candidate testing as well. (This after doing a Thunderbird
update just this last week.) Busy times for everyone. I encourage you to
check out the Firefox 3 beta**\*** and to submit issues found to
[Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org) to make the subsequent beta
that much better. **\* Note:** I must include the warning that this is a
beta and it can do weird or unexpected things. We encourage people to
not replace their normal Firefox browser for day to day use. This is for
testing purposes only, folks!
