I just got back from the OTO Yule potluck. I had some good conversations
with and various other parties. Saw a bunch of friends and a few people
that I detest. ;-) We had a pretty good turnout with a lot of non-OTO
members as well. Holiday food makes it near impossible to stay on my
diet. I don't cook food that's bad for me but when I'm at a gathering
and starving, it's hard to just walk away from the mashed potatoes.
Brandy and Ted gave me good advice on where to go in Greece and Bro.
Nobles pointed me to a jewelry smith. I'm thinking of making a new
magical ring with the ogdoadic star in a flat surface and a citrine or
topaz as a jewel in the center of it.
