I just found out that a Seattle iconic figure, Ed McMichael aka "the
Tuba Man," has just died. Ed played his tuba for decades outside of
sports games in the Seattle area. He was a childhood friend of my uncle
Karl's and they went to school together at King's Garden in Seattle.
When I was growing up, Ed was one of those regular figures that would
show up, usually at my grandparents' church in Wallingford, often joking
around with my uncle. I haven't seen Ed in probably a decade but I still
remember his distinctive voice and his kind heart. He was a good man and
definitely a local eccentric. I'm sorry to hear that he died before his
time because a bunch of thugs jumped and beat him. He was jumped on
October 25 and beaten badly. He was recovering from his injuries, it was
thought, when he died in his home this last Sunday night. For Seattle
people, the PI has an
[article](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/jamieson/386267_robert04xx.html)
about his death. There is also a [blog
post](http://seattle.metblogs.com/2008/11/05/rip-tuba-man/) on the
Seattle Metblogs.
