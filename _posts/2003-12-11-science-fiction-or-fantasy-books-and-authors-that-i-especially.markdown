**Note:** Now with cut tag!! I've recently been asked a number of times
about fiction that I like or enjoy. This is a document that I prepared
to this end... A preface, almost all of these are recent authors or
authors that I feel aren't well known. I'm not putting people that I
think everybody has heard of on this list. You won't see a list of my
old Frank Herbert books or books from 20 years ago. I'm not going to
list William Gibson or John Shirley, etc. because I figure if people
have an interest in them, they've probably heard of them long ago. You
won't find a lot of fantasy here though. The genre is nearly worthless
because of the complete and unimaginative crap that people choose to
write. **The British authors:**

> **Jon Grimwood** Unnamed Series (or at least "I don't know the name.")
>
> -   [Lucifer's
>     Dragon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0340674733/202-1639125-7655012)

>     - A favorite of mine. I will re-read this more than once.

> Arabesk Series An alternate future cyberpunkesque series set in a 21st
> century Alexandria where the Ottomon Empire never fell (but the world
> is largely the same anyway...) and the U.S. never entered World War I.
> The main character is of questionable genetic heritage and personality
> but people all seem to think he's someone important.

> -   [Pashazade](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743202848/202-1639125-7655012):

>     The Third Arabesk
>
> **John Meaney** These books are in order. **THI** was his first novel.
> **Paradox** and **Context** are part of a series with a third book to
> be out soon. **THI** takes place a few thousand years (at a guess)
> before the series. Excellent writing and a lot of good ideas about
> free will, predestination, and the like.

> he was trained to be part of an elite group of shock troops including
> tweaking his mental parameters in some less than enlightened ways.
> He's aware of it but, of course, it doesn't bother him much. The
> schtick of Richard Morgan's world is that people all have hardware
> attached to their spine that backs up and stores their minds so people
> can change bodies at the drop of a hat if they have the money and
> connections. Death is not permanent unless your "stack" is destroyed.
> The shock troops in question are specially trained to transfer bodies
> easily because the U.N. runs an intersteller nation connected by FTL
> communications but no FTL transportation. The only way to move faster
> than light is to have your mind "cast" to a new body at the other end.
> These novels are pretty violent, to say the least, given the lack of
> permanent death. There is a third novel on the way. **China Mieville**
> American editions are now available of both of these.
