<strong>Note:</strong> Now with cut tag!!

I've recently been asked a number of times about fiction that I like or enjoy. This is a document that I prepared to this end...

A preface, almost all of these are recent authors or authors that I  feel aren't well known. I'm not putting people that I think everybody has heard of on this list. You won't see a list of my old Frank Herbert books or books from 20 years ago. I'm not going to list William Gibson or John Shirley, etc. because I figure if people have an interest in them, they've probably heard of them long ago.

You won't find a lot of fantasy here though. The genre is nearly worthless because of the complete and unimaginative crap that people choose to write.

<strong>The British authors:</strong>
<blockquote><strong><u>Jon Grimwood</u></strong>

<u>Unnamed Series (or at least "I don't know the name.")</u>
<ul>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0340674733/202-1639125-7655012">Lucifer's Dragon</a></li>

	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671022601/202-1639125-7655012">redRobe</a> - A favorite of mine. I will re-read this more than once.</li>
</ul>
<u>Arabesk Series</u>

An alternate future cyberpunkesque series set in a 21st century Alexandria where the Ottomon Empire never fell (but the world is largely the same anyway...) and the U.S. never entered World War I. The main character is of questionable genetic heritage and personality but people all seem to think he's someone important.
<ul>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743202848/202-1639125-7655012">Pashazade</a>: The First Arabesk</li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743202856/202-1639125-7655012">Effendi</a>: The Second Arabesk</li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743461177/202-1639125-7655012">Felaheen</a>: The Third Arabesk</li>
</ul>
<strong><u>John Meaney</u></strong>

These books are in order. <strong>THI</strong> was his first novel. <strong>Paradox</strong> and <strong>Context</strong> are part of a series with a third book to be out soon. <strong>THI</strong> takes place a few thousand years (at a guess) before the series. Excellent writing and a lot of good ideas about free will, predestination, and the like.

</a></li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0593047354/202-1639125-7655012">Context</a></li>
</ul>
<strong><u>Ken MacLeod</u></strong>

Iain Banks' public school chum and friend of many decades. Comes from a fairly Leftist (especially compared to the U.S.) background. The politics of his characters range from being Trotskyites to being Libertarian Extropians. His own politics are a little harder to nail down but politics in general informs his books.

<u>Unnamed Interconnected Series</u>
<ul>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1857238338/qid=1068837124/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_3_2/202-3027204-2693418">Star Fraction 		</a><span style="text-decoration: none">- First novel by him</span></li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1841490601/qid=1068837124/sr=1-4/ref=sr_1_3_4/202-3027204-2693418">The Stone Canal</a><span style="text-decoration: none">- My favorite by him</span></li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1857237307/202-1639125-7655012">The Cassini Division</a></li>
</ul>
I've left out some of the books in the previous series as the three above are the best, in my opinion. The series has this weird tree-view of history so some of them take place with the same people in alternate timelines. The ones above are all in the same timeline.

<u>Engines of Light Series</u>
<ul>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1841490679/qid=1068837124/sr=1-6/ref=sr_1_3_6/202-3027204-2693418">Cosmonaut Keep
</a></li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1841490695/202-1639125-7655012">Dark Light</a></li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1841491489/202-1639125-7655012">Engine City</a></li>
</ul>
This is a trilogy. The ending isn't what I was hoping for but I still enjoyed them a bit. Not quite as good as his first series in my opinion.

<lj-cut text="Read the rest..."></lj-cut>

<u><strong>Alastair Reynolds</strong></u>

In order (a series with the last being two novellas):
<ul>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575068760/202-1639125-7655012">Revelation Space</a></li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575068787/qid=1068837345/sr=1-4/ref=sr_1_3_4/202-3027204-2693418">Chasm City</a></li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575068809/202-1639125-7655012">Redemption Ark</a></li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575074345/026-2304896-8014012">Absolution Gap</a> - Completes the series.</li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575075260/202-1639125-7655012">Diamond Dogs / Turquoise Days: Tales from the Revelation Space Universe</a></li>
</ul>
Alastair Reynolds is a real scientist who sets his stories in a fairly "real" science-based universe (no FTL drives) that is not a very friendly place for humans. Gritty and nasty.

<u><strong>Richard Morgan</strong></u>

In order (Altered Carbon is his first novel):
<ul>
	<li><span class="small"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345457684/ref=pd_pym_fi/002-1434878-3309659">Altered Carbon</a></span></li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575073241/202-1639125-7655012">Broken Angels</a></li>
</ul>
This falls into the "fucked up action adventure" science fiction camp. The main character is a bit of a psychopath but that's on purpose as he was trained to be part of an elite group of shock troops including tweaking his mental parameters in some less than enlightened ways. He's aware of it but, of course, it doesn't bother him much. The schtick of Richard Morgan's world is that people all have hardware attached to their spine that backs up and stores their minds so people can change bodies at the drop of a hat if they have the money and connections. Death is not permanent unless your "stack" is destroyed. The shock troops in question are specially trained to transfer bodies easily because the U.N. runs an intersteller nation connected by FTL communications but no FTL transportation. The only way to move faster than light is to have your mind "cast" to a new body at the other end. These novels are pretty violent, to say the least, given the lack of permanent death. There is a third novel on the way.

<u><strong>China Mieville</strong></u>

American editions are now available of both of these.
<ul>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0330392891/qid=1068837456/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_3_2/202-3027204-2693418">Perdido Street Station</a><span style="text-decoration: none">- Best urban fantasy by a Marxist ever...</span></li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0333781740/202-1639125-7655012">The Scar</a></li>
</ul>
The best person writing "fantasy" at this time. It helps that he despises the cookie cutter fantasy that's been the post-Tolkien staple of genre writing for the last few decades. A dedicated Marxist who recently received his PhD from the London School of Economics. He writes beautiful prose too.

<u><strong>Iain M. Banks</strong></u>

One of the best science fiction authors ever and mentor of Ken MacLeod.

<u>Culture Books</u>
<ul>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1857231384/qid=1068837568/sr=2-3/ref=sr_2_3_3/202-3027204-2693418">Consider Phlebas</a><span style="text-decoration: none"> - Sick bastard.</span></li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1857231465/qid=1068837568/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_3_1/202-3027204-2693418">The Player of Games</a></li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/185723135X/qid=1068837568/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3_3/202-3027204-2693418">Use of Weapons</a>- My favorite and a good Culture novel to start with. Sick and disturbing at times.</li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1857239695/202-1639125-7655012">Look to Windward</a></li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/185723457X/qid=1068837568/sr=1-6/ref=sr_1_3_6/202-3027204-2693418">Excession
</a></li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1857232739/qid=1068837568/sr=1-5/ref=sr_1_3_5/202-3027204-2693418">Feersum Endjinn
</a>- not a culture book but similar enough in content in many ways. The "creative" spelling of one of the characters is enough to stop a lot of people. You do get used to it eventually though.

Iain Banks is probably one of my top three favorite authors ever. His stuff just rocks my world. He's a sick bastard too, which helps. Don't look for reassurance about the sweetness and joy of life in his books. You aren't going to find it.

<u><strong>Justina Robson</strong></u>
<ul>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0330375660/202-1639125-7655012">Silver Screen</a></li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0330375679/202-1639125-7655012">Mappa Mundi</a></li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0333907450/202-1639125-7655012">Natural History</a></li>
</ul>
A new author of the last few years. <strong>Silver Screen</strong> was her first book. I like <strong>Natural History</strong> a bit but <strong>Mappa Mundi</strong>, which concerns a project to map and control the human mind, is my favorite of hers. Good idea books.

<u><strong>Adam Roberts</strong></u>
<ul>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575070641/202-1639125-7655012">Stone</a></li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/185798787X/qid=1068837794/sr=1-7/ref=sr_1_3_7/202-3027204-2693418">Salt
</a></li>
</ul>
Another recent author. I like his work. <strong>Salt</strong> was a bit Dune-like but set on a Salt world. His books have the virtue, in a sense, of being fairly short. He doesn't write the 1,000 page opus like Neal Stephenson does.

<u><strong>Neal Asher</strong></u>
<ul>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0330484338/202-1639125-7655012">Gridlinked</a></li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0333903641/202-1639125-7655012">The Skinner</a>- undead cop and skinning monster science fiction</li>
</ul>
Asher has more books here now. <strong>Gridlinked</strong> isn't as good as <strong>The Skinner</strong> but they take place in the same universe and I would have understood <strong>TS</strong> a lot more initially if I had read <strong>Gridlinked</strong> first.

<u><strong>Greg Egan</strong></u>

Australian actually. Much of his stuff is available in U.S. editions.
<ul>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0061057274/qid=1071167339/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-6739938-3337466?v=glance&amp;s=books">Distress</a></li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575071230/202-1639125-7655012">Schild's Ladder</a></li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0752809253/qid=1068837934/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_2_3/202-3027204-2693418">Diaspora
</a></li>
</ul>
Much of his work is what the Extropian/Transhumanist types would like to point to as examples of their thought and vision. I liked <strong>Distress</strong> quite a bit as an early novel. <strong>Diaspora</strong> is my favorite by him though.

<u><strong>Ian McDonald</strong></u> - (U.S. editions for some of these)
<ul>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553374354/qid=1068838007/sr=1-14/ref=sr_1_0_14/202-3027204-2693418">Evolution's Shore</a> (British edition: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1857988752/qid=1068838104/sr=1-23/ref=sr_1_2_23/202-3027204-2693418">Chaga</a>)</li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1857988760/202-1639125-7655012">Kirinya</a> (sequel to Evolution's Shore aka Chaga)</li>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671037544/qid=1068838230/sr=1-58/ref=sr_1_0_58/202-3027204-2693418">Ares Express</a> - Cool Mars book.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Areas Express</strong> is one of my favorite recent books. I really enjoyed his telling of a Mars story. A Mars where terraforming was done by intelligent machines for us hundreds of years ago and reality isn't always what it seems. Giant trains too.

<u><strong>Paul McAuley</strong></u>
<ul>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380794292/qid=1071168163/sr=1-4/ref=sr_1_4/103-6739938-3337466?v=glance&amp;s=books">Fairyland</a> - One of my favorite books of the last ten years. Man invents Faerie and not the nice kind either.</li>

</ul>
<u>Confluence Trilogy</u>

Set in a world millions of years from now that circles a black hole and was, seemingly, constructed by our descendents after they got done shaping the entire galaxy to their liking. The makers have left and only the altered and uplifted animal servants that they created are left behind along with the intelligent machines that made the world.

<u><strong>Michael Marshall Smith</strong></u>
<ul>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553579703/qid=1071168767/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/103-6739938-3337466?v=glance&amp;s=books">Only Forward</a> - A seemingly straightforward action adventure novel for the first couple of chapters until it takes a left turn into the extremely weird. My favorite of his.</li>

The main character is a less than sympathetic fellow that guards clones for spare parts as a dead end job. Another "left turn into the weird" kind of book. Smith seems to specialize in those.</li>
</ul>
<u><strong>David Gemmell</strong></u>

The only longterm career genre fantasy writer in this list. Some of his novels don't especially stand out but a number of them too and one or two are considered, by me, to be amongst the best single fantasy novels. The worlds are not always especially original but the stories and especially characters are often the best.

<u>Drenai Books</u>

The Drenai are the main "civilized" people of his general fantasy setting.
<ul>
	<li> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0345379063/qid=1071170201/sr=1-9/ref=sr_1_9/102-6321539-9116150?v=glance&amp;s=books">Legend</a> - The story of the final battle of Druss, a hero so great that he was called "the Legend." What happens when you are the most famous hero in the world, go on a quest to save your one true love, save her and settle down and then proceed to get old as the world moves on. This is Gemmell's finest story in my opinion. I recommend this one to people all of the time.</li>

How do you come to terms with your life when you've spent so much of it as a cold-blooded assassin?</li>
</ul>
<u>The Rigante Series</u>

These are kind of an alternate fantasy history of the Scottish peoples. The first few are pre-Roman (the people of Stone here) and the last two are set in the equivalent of the 17th or 18th century against the English.

<strong>The American Authors</strong> (a lot fewer of these now...)<strong>:</strong>
<blockquote><u><strong>Daniel Keys Moran</strong></u>

Most of his work is long out of print but some of it is being republished. I have multiple copies of the Trent books (<strong>EE, TLR, TLD</strong>) and have given them away to people before. I've read them many times.

<u><strong>Michael Swanwick</strong></u>

Probably the finest writer on this list for the actual craft of writing. Swanwick seems to have no consistent "voice" that you can recognize in his work. He has a nearly unique ability to change his voice, style, methods from story to story. He is well known as one of the finest short story writers currently working and for which he has won many awards.

<u><strong>Scott Westerfeld </strong></u>

Scott has written quite a few books. These are the first two in his current series and seem to be his best writing so far. An undead emperor and a cult of humans who worship AI clash. Immortality through undeath is the carrot on the stick of this empire...
