I just returned from attending a two day workshop over the weekend in Dayton, Ohio with the Blue Lotus Assembly. This was held at the main dojo for

Hayes' Quest Center</a>, which is the home of <a href="http://www.skhquest.com/articles/ToShinDoDescription.asp">To-Shin Do</a>. To-Shin Do is the martial art that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_K._Hayes">Stephen Hayes</a>, known to those of us in the Blue Lotus Assembly as "Master Jien" developed and teaches. He did a weekend training on aspects of esoteric Buddhist practice (mikkyo). Since I had never met him or many other members of the Blue Lotus Assembly in person before (only members of <a href="http://www.daiun-ji.org/">Daiun-Ji Great Cloud Temple</a>), this seemed to be a good opportunity to attend an interesting training session and to meet people. I flew in to Cincinnati on Friday night and Jiun Foster, who runs Daiun-Ji and with whom I study, met me at the airport. I stayed with him and his family over the weekend and we went up to Dayton from there. I had an excellent time and it was good to finally put faces to names. <a href="http://www.psych-insights.com/richardbio.htm">Jisho Sears</a> and I were introduced, which is good since he is one of the people teaching at the retreat that R and I are attending for Daiun-Ji in late June. I have a nice picture of Jisho Sensei and Jiun Sensei below: <p align="center">

It was nice to finally meet Master Jien and I was fortunate enough to get to go out to dinner with him and some of the others on Sunday. Overall, I had an excellent time at the retreat. Jiun Sensei and I were able to record his interview as well, so I would expect that the first real Ex Templo podcast will be put up fairly soon.
