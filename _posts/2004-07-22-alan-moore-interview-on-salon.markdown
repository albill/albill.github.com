<a href="http://www.boingboing.net">BoingBoing Blog</a> has mentioned this today. Alan Moore has an interview on Salon at <a href="http://www.salon.com/books/int/2004/07/22/moore/index_np.html">http://www.salon.com/books/int/2004/07/22/moore/index_np.html</a>.<blockquote><i>The lesson there, as Moore explains it, is that to understand the world one lives in, one has to give "coherence to ... complexity, to say that it is possible to think about politics, history, mythology, architecture, murder and the rest of it all at the same time to see how it connects." And Moore's work is nothing if not complex. His explorations of the ways humanity deludes and condemns itself have done more to overcome the anti-comics prejudice of the American and European literary establishment than anything else in the comics genre. And he imparts a whole lot more information than Fox News or CNN.</i></blockquote>
