I just got out of taking the [Graduate Record
Exam](http://www.ets.org/gre/) (GRE) an hour ago. For those that never
paid attention or simply didn't care, this is, effectively, the graduate
school equivalent of the SAT for most people (leaving aside GMAT and
other things). It is divided into three sections: verbal, quantitative,
and analytical. I originally took this back in 1993, in preparation for
graduate school then. I had originally planned to get an Anthropology
PhD back in the day. Instead of doing that, I got married and a job. As
I've said before, I don't think it would have worked out well then
anyway. I had no real focus and was pretty much a spaz when I graduated
from my undergraduate years anyway. When I took the GRE then, it was the
first year it was computerized and there were no essay questions.
Starting in 2002, they made the analytical section into a two part
writing test, one of which is arguing for a point of view of your own on
a question you are given, and the other where you analyze the potential
problems with another argument which is presented to you. This is graded
by humans (on a sale from 1 to 6), so you don't get instant results
anymore. In 1993, I received the following scores: **Verbal:** 660
(90^th^ percentile) **Quantitative:** 620 (62^nd^ percentile)
**Analytical:** 780 (97^th^ percentile) Today, I received: **Verbal:**
680 **Quantitative:** 560 I'll know the analytical score in roughly two
weeks or so. According to a
[guide](http://www.ets.org/Media/Tests/GRE/pdf/994994.pdf) that the GRE
people publish, my verbal score is roughly at the 96^th^ percentile and
my quantitative is at the 40^th^ percentile. (It's a good thing that I
work professionally within engineering, isn't it!!) Having not cracked a
math related book in, oh, 18 years or so, I'm not surprised by the
latter score and don't care since I'm looking at a Humanities doctoral
program. I was hoping to break 700 with my verbal score, so I am a
little annoyed. They actually give you that section twice (or is it just
broken in half) and I know I made a few mistakes in the second that I
shouldn't have. The whole test took me about three hours and the first
hour and 15 minutes are for the writing portion. At least this is done
with before I leave for Egypt in a week.
