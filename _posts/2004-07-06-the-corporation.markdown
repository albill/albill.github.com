R and I went out this evening and saw **[The
Corporation](http://www.thecorporation.com/)**, the recent documentary
on the rise of corporate power, with my friend, John, from work and his
visiting dad. I thought that the movie was a very effective display of
issues to do with the corporate dominance of the modern world and its
immediate effect on our lives. It's all around us, like the air that we
breathe.

Of course, it is kind of humorous to be watching this with a friend from
my corporate work and to see a few images and what-not drawn from work
websites and such sprinkled in here and there.

The ultimate effect of seeing this movie is much the same as when I read
**[Ishmael](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553375407)**
by Daniel Quinn which, along with a number of other factors, helped
trigger a precursor of my inevitable mid-life crisis of years to come.
The movie even used the same metaphor of being in an airplane
(civilization) which is convinced it is flying along great through the
sky but, really, it is falling towards the ground off of the cliff it is
launched from....the ground is just so far away, that it can't be seen
by most yet so everyone is convinced that it is flying along fine. The
effect caused is an inevitable feeling of helplessness. I'm watching a
train wreck as it happens to some degree.

We live an unsustainable lifestyle. As currently existing, I work in an
unsustainable industry that adds, at times, questionable value to the
world. Even if that wasn't in question, I work for one of the most
powerful technical corporations in the world. We could buy and sell
small countries if we wanted. I am a cog in a machine and many of my
values have some dissonance with this at times. Rationally, I know that
where I am is not any better or worse than elsewhere in many ways
(except for me) and that is our system as a whole that plummets all of
us toward the abyss.

What am I supposed to do? Make pottery in a barn in Vermont? Even if I
did, I would still be part of the overall system of commerce. It is a
matrix that the entire world is embedded in at this point. Even the
state communists have embraced it as the future.

Part of my draw to unconventional spirituality, not all but part, has
been the knowledge that its experiences are immediate. That any gnosis
is mine. It hasn't been packaged up by thousands of years of
institutions completely focused on their own survival and sucking the
lifeblood out of any actual spiritual wonder. It is one thing that will
never be taken from me, packaged, and sold back unless I let them do it.
Otherwise, I might as well just joyfully embrace the crass consumerism
of our culture with no qualms and buy a nice car, nice clothes and the
perfect toys to fill the time with until I die.

John made the crack "...*and tomorrow, we're both going to go in and
turn in our resignations, right?*" He's right in that we're not but it
is good to wake up now and again, look around, and evaluate what you're
doing with yourself and what the world is doing to you as well.
