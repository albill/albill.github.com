I'm seeing a lot of people ranting about Arnold being governor and what a catastrophy it is... I'm rather unconvinced. I think he's going to be hamstrung and in over his head but I really doubt if he will mismanage your state any worse than Davis.

On the plus note, he's Pro-Choice and Pro-Gay Rights so you could be worse off.

My own governor is the best Republican governor we've ever had, as the joke goes. (He's a Democrat...)
