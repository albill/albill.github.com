*The Man*

R and I made it back this afternoon from Burning Man. Lucky me, I get to
go back to work tomorrow. I've been up for most of 24 hours now because,
as it turns out, the serial killer van tends to overheat when it is in
stop and go traffic in 90+ degree weather. (This fact was noticed as we
made our way onto the playa at Burning Man with the needle nearly
red-lined the whole way...). We left at 3:00 AM this morning in order to
avoid the two to four hour lines that commonly happen during exodus on
Sunday and Monday, which would have blown the van in the heat.
Unfortunately, our headlights turn out to have a switch that likes to
randomly turn them off after the van has been running a while, so we had
to wait until dawn after we got out in order to drive down the two lane
rural highway in the middle of Nevada in order to leave. The above kind
of sets the tone for Burning Man for me on one end this year. We had a
great time with our friends at the **Kingdom of Loafington** this year.
These were some of the same people that we had camped with in 2001 and
it is a good crew of folks. Pretty much everything to do with our
Burning Man experience on the playa was great. We missed the seven hour
whiteout dust storm on Monday (but not the five hour one on Saturday) by
coming on Wednesday. The heat was only really heavy on a couple of days.
For the first time, I actually brought a bike, which allowed me to get
out to see the Man and the Temple much more easily than previous years.
Because of the move of Black Rock City to a new site and this year's
weather, we found that biking was actually quite difficult in many
places due to giant dust drifts, up to a foot deep in places, which
would bog you down or dump you but this was actually pretty minor. R and
I wandered quite a bit and had some decent fun watching the recruits to
the Kingdom being put through their paces in order to be initiated as
loyal subjects of Loafington. It was definitely worth it to not leave on
Sunday and to see the Temple burn. Unlike the burning of the Man, which
is a pretty loud and frenzied event, the crowd at the Temple burn (which
was much smaller), mostly sat down and was completely silent while it
burned. There was even a bit of singing and chanting, in a solemn
manner, was we spent most of an hour watching it come down.

Getting into and out of the playa with our can (and the travel from
California) was a bit nervewracking, from things like the aforementioned
overheating to the leaky transmission seal or even the massive
over-acceleration in park if the engine was flooded wrong while trying
to start it (acting like a stuck peddle). I was ready to kiss the ground
when we pulled up in front of our house and I'm definitely not taking
this van on any more interstate trips. I'm feeling a bit sleep deprived
so I'll leave it at that. We're really glad that we went and the
experience is rather hard to describe if you've never been. I have put
up a very large [photo
set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/sets/72157607063681202/) on
Flickr though.
