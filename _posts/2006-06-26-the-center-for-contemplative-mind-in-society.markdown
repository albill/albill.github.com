A month or two ago, I found the website for the Center for Contemplative
Mind in Society. They are at
[http://www.contemplativemind.org/.](http://www.contemplativemind.org/)
They describe themselves as follows:

> The Center for Contemplative Mind in Society is a 501-c(3) non-profit
> organization which works to integrate contemplative awareness and
> contemporary life, to help create a more just, compassionate, and
> reflective society. [Contemplative
> practices](http://www.contemplativemind.org/practices/), including
> prayer, meditation, yoga, and many contemplative arts, help
> individuals regain balance and calm in the midst of challenging
> circumstances. This state of calm centeredness provides effective
> stress reduction and can also help address issues of meaning, values,
> and spirit. Contemplative practices can help people develop greater
> empathy and communication skills, improve focus and concentration,
> reduce stress and enhance creativity. In time, with sustained
> commitment, they cultivate insight, wise discernment, and a loving and
> compassionate approach to life. While personal transformation does not
> guarantee the transformation of social institutions, the Center is
> grounded in the belief that contemplative awareness can assist
> individuals and groups in identifying the root causes of social
> problems and finding creative approaches to eliminating them.

I'm impressed by their approach and the overall vibe of the site. They
have a [tree of contemplative
practices](http://www.contemplativemind.org/practices/tree.html) up that
shows their emphasis as well. This is definitely the kind of
organization that I think our culture is more in need of with the
current emphasis on consumerism and competition. They put their money
where with their intentions as well. Along with the other work they do,
they fund [Contemplative Practice
Fellowships](http://www.acls.org/conprac.htm):

> ...Approximately ten fellowships will be offered to support individual
> or collaborative research leading to the development of courses and
> teaching materials that integrate contemplative practices into
> courses. These fellowships are designed to advance scholarship in the
> field, to encourage a recognition of the role of contemplation in the
> intellectual life, and to inform educational practice and enhance
> course design. We invite proposals from the full range of disciplinary
> and inter-disciplinary perspectives in the arts, humanities, and
> humanities-related sciences and social sciences. Methodologies that
> include practical and experiential approaches to the subject matter
> are especially welcome.

I would encourage some of my Buddhist friends with the energy and
motivation to create materials to think about applying for one of their
fellowships. This is all very good.
