I found this link today through a blogger mentioning that they'd
recently listened to Bruce's rant at SXSW this year.

Close your SXSW Interactive panel experience with the traditional
Tuesday-afternoon talk from the outspoken author and leader of the
Veridian Design Movement. A feed of podcasts from many of the speakers
at SXSW 2007 can be found
[here](http://feeds.feedburner.com/SXSWpodcasts) as well.
