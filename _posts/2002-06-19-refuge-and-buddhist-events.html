<img width="200" vspace="3" hspace="10" height="280" border="2" align="right" src="http://www.arcanology.com/images/medicine-buddha.gif" />I've never taken formal refuge in ceremony except for the "mini-refuge" during the Green Tara empowerment. I will be taking refuge at the <a href="http://www.sakya.org">Sakya Monastery</a> on June 30 at 11:15 am to correct this. I've been wanting to do this but they only do the ceremony every so often.

On Saturday, July 6,  Saturday, July 6th, H.H. JD Sakya will bestow a Medicine Buddha Empowerment at the Monastery at 10am. I've actually been reading several books on the Medicine Buddha, lore around him and about Tibetan medicine. I will be taking this empowerment at that time.

I'm quite excited to be doing this. I'm very interested in certain aspects of healing arts though this isn't something that I've ever really found the energy and time to pursue. It <strong>is</strong> something that seems to reoccur in my thoughts.
