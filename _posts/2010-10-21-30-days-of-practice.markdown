Now, I have a somewhat regular practice of sitting though I haven't made a point of doing the same amount at the same times every day. I also haven't always done the same practices, outside of sitting, every day. This discipline has often been difficult for me though I generally try to roll with it and be compassionate towards myself. I am setting this for myself as a challenge, starting this weekend. I'm blogging about it, which I generally do not do about my practice, because I want to encourage other Buddhists with whom I work in the seminary and elsewhere to possibly do it as well. As part of this, I've outlined a basic practice below. I'm actually going to do a bit more than this but the form below is drawn from the one used within the Five Mountain Sangha, so I will be doing something very similar. What is below could be considered a good minimal version for many Zen practitioners or others within the Mahayana tradition. As you will note, we generally practice in English in my school, thinking it is better to understand what one is saying rather than chanting in some exotic sounding language but forgetting the meaning. When we do chant in other languages, with the exception of mantras or dharanis, we follow that with the same chant in English. I encourage other people to consider taking up the challenge of maintaining a regular and formal practice for a 30 day period during the next month in order to see how it does (or does not) affect your relationship to practice and the Dharma. <h2>
