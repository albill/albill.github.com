This is pretty cool from a geek, off the grid, point of view. From Gizmodo...
<h3><a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/powerpod.php" rel="bookmark">Powerpod </a></h3><img width="200" height="152" align="right" src="http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/images/powerpod.jpg" alt="Powerpod image" />The Powerpod is an all-in-one solar powered dynamo for powering radio, lighting, and other emergency services in disaster areas, or providing the household energy needs for small houses off the grid. In cases where solar is not the preferred option, the Powerpod can be configured to run via hydro or wind input, as well. Pricing runs from $1250 to $3365, depending on configuration.

Add a blender and an ice machine, and you've got yourself a fine disaster relief plan.
