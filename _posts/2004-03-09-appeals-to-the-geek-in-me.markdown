This is pretty cool from a geek, off the grid, point of view. From
Gizmodo...

![Powerpod

is an all-in-one solar powered dynamo for powering radio, lighting, and
other emergency services in disaster areas, or providing the household
energy needs for small houses off the grid. In cases where solar is not
the preferred option, the Powerpod can be configured to run via hydro or
wind input, as well. Pricing runs from $1250 to $3365, depending on
configuration. Add a blender and an ice machine, and you've got yourself
a fine disaster relief plan. [**Read**](http://powerpod.com) [*Thanks,
