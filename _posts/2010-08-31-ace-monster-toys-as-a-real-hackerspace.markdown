I've been meaning to post an update for [Ace Monster
Toys](http://www.acemonstertoys.org/display/AMT/Home), the hackerspace
that I co-founded recently in Berkeley. I last [posted about
it](http://www.openbuddha.com/2010/06/17/ace-monster-toys-all-on-board/)
in mid-June. We had just elected our board and begun collecting dues
while we were looking for a space to rent. I'm happy to tell people that
we did find a space and moved into it at the end of July. We've been
there for an entire month now. It is at [6050 Lowell
Street](http://www.acemonstertoys.org/display/AMT/6050+Lowell+Street) in
northern Oakland, which is the tri-border area where Oakland,
Emeryville, and Berkeley come together. We're a 20 minute walk from the
Ashby station in Berkeley or a quick bike ride. I don't have any great
photos of the space except some I took of the space when were were
examining the building. We have 800 sq ft in two concrete floored rooms
downstairs and 800 sq ft in one larger room upstairs (pictured below)
giving us a fairly large overall space. The build out of the space has
taken a little longer than we initially expected but we're making
progress. Right now, we have a conference table, a couch, and about 10
desks upstairs along with a packet radio station, a broken makerbot, and
an unassembled makerbot. The downstairs is full of tools from building
our desks (which is an interesting project in and of itself). Soon,
we'll have at least one more couch and conference table upstairs as
well. It took us a few weeks of fighting to get high speed Internet but
it is finally working (Comcast sucks, by the way) so people can actually
get work done while in the space. Dr. Jesus, one of our board members,
also built an electronic entry system for our door, giving us 24 hour
access to the space. Another member, Dennis, who is an architect, has
been [working on
designs](http://www.acemonstertoys.org/display/AMT/Build+Out+Design+1)
in Google Sketchup for the space but we're kind of jury rigging things
as we go right now.

AMT has somewhere between 16 and 20 active members and seem to be
picking up a few a week right now. We continue to meet every Monday
night at 7:30 PM for a general meeting, demonstrations, and workshops.
Our first quarterly meeting is in two weeks where we will induct new
members officially into the organization. You can [join our e-mail
list](http://lists.acemonstertoys.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/discuss)
if you're interested in the group or [go to the
wiki](http://www.acemonstertoys.org/display/AMT) for more information.
My next personal projects at AMT are:

-   Finally building my makerbot
-   Building my Zen Toolworks CNC mill (from a kit)
-   Beginning to work on my DIY Drone using a megaduino and some off the
    shelf electronics inspired by [DIY Drones](http://diydrones.com/)
    and a Defcon 18 talk that showed how easy it really is (by some
    definitions of "easy")
-   Building a trike with Mike G. (who is building a tandem trike) using
    plans from [Atomic Zombie](http://atomiczombie.com/) (This will
    involve a bit of welding so we've been delayed by ventilation needs)

Other people are working on far more interesting projects as we get
tools into the space. I encourage anyone local to the Bay Area,
especially the East Bay, or coming through to contact us and stop by.
