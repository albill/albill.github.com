Well, I'm a married man now. Many of you were there with us on Saturday and it was quite an event. The whole week leading up to it was rush, rush, rush and then, bam!, the event itself. I'm glad that everyone came who did. We had an excellent time and we were really glad to share it with our family and friends. In six hours, I'm getting up to go to the airport for Italy. I'll be posting the wedding ritual following this post.
