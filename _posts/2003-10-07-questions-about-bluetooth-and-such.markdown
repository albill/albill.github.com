I may not be a simple man (or maybe I am???) but I want something
simple:

-   A PDA type device that reliably does Bluetooth or something very
    similar
-   A decent portable keyboard to talk to said device
-   a way for said device to get this data onto other computers or the
    internet

Is this too much to ask?
