I may not be a simple man (or maybe I am???) but I want something simple:
<ul>
	<li>A PDA type device that reliably does Bluetooth or something very similar</li>
	<li>A decent portable keyboard to talk to said device</li>
	<li>a way for said device to get this data onto other computers or the internet</li>
</ul>
Is this too much to ask?
