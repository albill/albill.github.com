I'd heard about this case locally and perhaps I'm missing what the big deal is. I was an Odd Fellow for a number of years and I know exactly what "Hector" or "Lefty" were used for. It isn't anything grimmer than realizing that the Grim Reaper comes for us all, just like on the tarot card.

One thing that the article doesn't mention is that it was, at one point, common practice for Odd Fellows to will their corpses to the order for this very purpose. What could be more fraternal? It doesn't happen anymore but it was never nefarious.

The article is lying when it makes it sound like this is something that went out of vogue 50 years or more ago. Again, without mentioning any details (since it would be inappropriate even though I am not longer a current member of the IOOF), I wouldn't know about all of this if it wasn't something that I heard about through the order. ;-)

It is cute to know that people give them names though.
