I just found <a href="http://www.current.tv/burningman/"><strong>TV Free Burning Man</strong></a> this evening. This is a rather cool site of videos that were recorded each day on the playa and uploaded to a website. After watching the videos, I feel it does as good of a job of capturing the spirit of Burning Man as I've seen in media. It's pretty cool.
