I used to be a big fan of [Ill Will Press](http://www.illwillpress.com/)
and Foamy the Squirrel a few years back. I have a Foamy coffee mug (with
him giving the finger) and a DVD that my wife bought for me. At least
one person is convinced that I sound like Foamy when I start ranting
(hi, Sean!). I lost track of Foamy as the schtick started getting a bit
old but I came across this today. It is Foamy ranting about the use of
Zen in American Marketing (your old Dharma Burgers). I just about fell
out of my chair laughing but then I love the angry squirrel. "The Zen of
Anger is all you need to master. Arrrgh!" I encourage everyone to take a
moment out for a little decompression with a rant from Foamy. Watch it
below or [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw5lsBHecvM).
