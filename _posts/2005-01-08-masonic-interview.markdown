The local Masons finally called me back. They are interviewing me
tomorrow. Luckily, because of the weather and such, we are meeting at a
local coffeeshop, which means I don't have to make my home presentable
to them. Given the state of my kitchen floor, that's a relief. I suppose
that I can seem normal enough and keep the tourette's under control for
long enough for the Masons to like me. I know that this same group of
Masons have accepted people that I consider, in a good way, seriously
freaky so I'm probably not too far out of the mainstream for them. I
remember when I interviewed with the Odd Fellows, when I was about 22 or
23. We met at a coffeehouse and one of them was actually odd enough that
he wanted Postum from the barrista. She dug out this old, dusty box of
it... I'll let people know how it goes.
