The local Masons finally called me back. They are interviewing me tomorrow. Luckily, because of the weather and such, we are meeting at a local coffeeshop, which means I don't have to make my home presentable to them. Given the state of my kitchen floor, that's a relief. I suppose that I can seem normal enough and keep the tourette's under control for long enough for the Masons to like me. I know that this same group of Masons have accepted people that I consider, in a good way, seriously freaky so I'm probably not too far out of the mainstream for them. I remember when I interviewed with the Odd Fellows, when I was about 22 or 23. We met at a coffeehouse and one of them was actually odd enough that he wanted Postum from the barrista. She dug out this old, dusty box of it... I'll let people know how it goes.
