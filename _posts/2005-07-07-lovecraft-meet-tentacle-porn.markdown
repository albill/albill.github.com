## Spotlight: CthulhuTech

![image](http://www.arcanology.com/images/ctech-250.jpg) **Mythos &
Mecha Meet** The strange aeon has come. The human species fights to
survive against the incursion of the Fungi from Yuggoth, the power of
the Cults, and the darkness of the recently arisen Great Old Ones. But
humanity, ever-adaptable, is far from helpless... having learned some of
the very knowledge of the enemy. Giant arcanotechnology war
machines—mecha by any other name—close the gap between between survival
and mythos domination. **The Aeon War Rages** CthulhuTech is a seamless
melding of the eldritch horror inspired by H. P. Lovecraft, and Japanese
mecha anime the likes of Robotech, the Guyver, or Neon Genesis:
Evangelion. This storytelling game puts players in the thick of the Aeon
War—Humanity's last stand to hold Earth and survive against dominance by
the Mi-Go and the Great Old Ones. Whether it's getting in the cockpit of
a sleek NEG mech, storming into battle in a powerful mythos-hybrid
Engel, or waging shadow wars as a mythos-symbiote Tager [pictured at
right], CthulhuTech takes players into a new and exciting world formed
from their favorite influences. Black Sky Studios has joined forces with
Sam Araya and other fine artists to bring you CthulhuTech. The
CthulhuTech Core Book contains everything you need to begin play, in a
densely-packed hardbound book of high quality with beautiful art.
Further supplements are also being planned. **CthulhuTech Core Book**
