R and I went to Pancho Villa's Restaurant last night. This is a kitschy place that I had read about. All of the waiters are dressed up as Pancho Villa and the place has an pseudo-old Mexicana decor. Lots of pictures on the walls from the 19th century (or early 20th century films about Pancho Villa). Good ambiance.

The food was the best that we've had so far and cost about half of what you would have paid for it near Cancun. (Cancun and the east coast of the Yucatan have American prices for pretty much everything being high tourist areas.)

We have the house special steaks, a bunch of mojitos (it was happy hour so we got twice what we ordered), and a good flan for dessert. Mmmm....
