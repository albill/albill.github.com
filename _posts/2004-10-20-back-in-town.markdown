R and I arrived home about an hour ago from the airport. We went to the airport in Rome at about 8:30 AM local time, which makes that about 22 hours ago or a bit less, and have been on the grand tour of the airports of the world.

It's good to be home.

On a plus note, once cancer kitty is now cured, having had treatment for his hyperthyroidism while we are away. He seems to be gaining weight back already.

If you want to reach me, you know how. I'll be online a bit over the next couple of days. I don't go back to work until Monday though I'm likely to stop by briefly.
