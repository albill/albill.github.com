This is from the Harvard Gazette back in April, 2002. Interesting but  preliminary validation of Tummo meditation.

<h2>Meditation changes temperatures:</h2>
<h4><em>Mind controls body in extreme experiments</em></h4>
<strong>By William J. Cromie </strong>  Gazette Staff

In a monastery in northern India, thinly clad Tibetan monks sat quietly  in a room where the temperature was a chilly 40 degrees Fahrenheit.  Using a yoga technique known as g Tum-mo, they entered a state of deep  meditation. Other monks soaked 3-by-6-foot sheets in cold water (49  degrees) and placed them over the meditators' shoulders. For untrained  people, such frigid wrappings would produce uncontrolled shivering.

If body temperatures continue to drop under these conditions, death  can result. But it was not long before steam began rising from the  sheets. As a result of body heat produced by the monks during  meditation, the sheets dried in about an hour.

Attendants removed the sheets, then covered the meditators with a  second chilled, wet wrapping. Each monk was required to dry three sheets  over a period of several hours.

Why would anyone do this? Herbert Benson, who has been studying g  Tum-mo for 20 years, answers that "Buddhists feel the reality we live in  is not the ultimate one. There's another reality we can tap into that's  unaffected by our emotions, by our everyday world. Buddhists believe  this state of mind can be achieved by doing good for others and by  meditation. The heat they generate during the process is just a  by-product of g Tum-mo meditation."

Benson is an associate professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical  School and president of the Mind/Body Medical Institute at Beth Israel  Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He firmly believes that studying  advanced forms of meditation "can uncover capacities that will help us  to better treat stress-related illnesses."

Benson developed the "relaxation response," which he describes as "a  physiological state opposite to stress." It is characterized by  decreases in metabolism, breathing rate, heart rate, and blood pressure.  He and others have amassed evidence that it can help those suffering  from illnesses caused or exacerbated by stress. Benson and colleagues  use it to treat anxiety, mild and moderate depression, high blood  pressure, heartbeat irregularities, excessive anger, insomnia, and even  infertility. His team also uses this type of simple meditation to calm  those who have been traumatized by the deaths of others, or by diagnoses  of cancer or other painful, life-threatening illnesses.

"More than 60 percent of visits to physicians in the United States  are due to stress-related problems, most of which are poorly treated by  drugs, surgery, or other medical procedures," Benson maintains.

The Mind/Body Medical Institute is now training people to use the  relaxation response to help people working at Ground Zero in New York  City, where two airplanes toppled the World Trade Center Towers last  Sept. 11. Facilities have been set up at nearby St. Paul's Chapel to aid  people still working on clearing wreckage and bodies. Anyone else who  feels stressed by those terrible events can also obtain help at the  chapel. "We are training the trainers who work there," Benson says.

The relaxation response involves repeating a word, sound, phrase, or  short prayer while disregarding intrusive thoughts. "If such an  easy-to-master practice can bring about the remarkable changes we  observe," Benson notes. "I want to investigate what advanced forms of  meditation can do to help the mind control physical processes once  thought to be uncontrollable."
<h3>Breathtaking results</h3>
Some Westerners practice g Tum-mo, but it often takes years to reach  states like those achieved by Buddhist monks. In trying to find groups  he could study, Benson met Westerners who claimed to have mastered such  advanced techniques, but who were, in his words, "fraudulent."

Benson decided that he needed to locate a religious setting, where  advanced mediation is traditionally practiced. His opportunity came in  1979 when the Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of Tibet, visited Harvard  University. "His Holiness agreed to help me," recalls Benson. That visit  was the beginning of a long friendship and several expeditions to  northern India where many Tibetan monks live in exile.

During visits to remote monasteries in the 1980s, Benson and his team  studied monks living in the Himalayan Mountains who could, by g Tum-mo  meditation, raise the temperatures of their fingers and toes by as much  as 17 degrees. It has yet to be determined how the monks are able to  generate such heat.

The researchers also made measurements on practitioners of other  forms of advanced meditation in Sikkim, India. They were astonished to  find that these monks could lower their metabolism by 64 percent. "It  was an astounding, breathtaking [no pun intended] result," Benson  exclaims.

To put that decrease in perspective, metabolism, or oxygen  consumption, drops only 10-15 percent in sleep and about 17 percent  during simple meditation. Benson believes that such a capability could  be useful for space travel. Travelers might use meditation to ease  stress and oxygen consumption on long flights to other planets.

In 1985, the meditation team made a video of monks drying cold, wet  sheets with body heat. They also documented monks spending a winter  night on a rocky ledge 15,000 feet high in the Himalayas. The sleep-out  took place in February on the night of the winter full moon when  temperatures reached zero degrees F. Wearing only woolen or cotton  shawls, the monks promptly fell asleep on the rocky ledge, They did not  huddle together and the video shows no evidence of shivering. They slept  until dawn then walked back to their monastery.
<h3>Overcoming obstacles</h3>
Working in isolated monasteries in the foothills of the Himalayas  proved extremely difficult. Some religious leaders keep their meditative  procedures a closely guarded secret. Medical measuring devices require  electrical power and wall outlets are not always available. In addition,  trying to meditate while strangers attempt to measure your rectal  temperature is not something most monks are happy to do.

To avoid these problems, Instructor in Psychology Sara Lazar, a  Benson colleague, used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan the  brains of meditators at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. The  subjects were males, aged 22-45, who had practiced a form of advanced  mediation called Kundalini daily for at least four years. In these  experiments, the obstacles of cold and isolation were replaced by the  difficulties of trying to meditate in a cramped, noisy machine. However,  the results, published in the May 15, 2000, issue of the journal  NeuroReport, turned out to be significant.

"Lazar found a marked decrease in blood flow to the entire brain,"  Benson explains. "At the same time, certain areas of the brain became  more active, specifically those that control attention and autonomic  functions like blood pressure and metabolism. In short, she showed the  value of using this method to record changes in the brain's activity  during meditation."

The biggest obstruction in further studies, whether in India or  Boston, has always been money. Research proceeded slowly and  intermittently until February 2001, when Benson's team received a $1.25  million grant from Loel Guinness, via the beer magnate's Kalpa  Foundation, established to study extraordinary human capacities.

The funds enabled researchers to bring three monks experienced in g  Tum-mo to a Guinness estate in Normandy, France, last July. The monks  then practiced for 100 days to reach their full meditative capacity. An  eye infection sidelined one of the monks, but the other two proved able  to dry frigid, wet sheets while wearing sensors that recorded changes in  heat production and metabolism.

Although the team obtained valuable data, Benson concludes that "the  room was not cold enough to do the tests properly." His team will try  again this coming winter with six monks. They will start practice in  late summer and should be ready during the coldest part of winter.

Benson feels sure these attempts to understand advanced mediation  will lead to better treatments for stress-related illnesses. "My hope,"  he says, "is that self-care will stand equal with medical drugs,  surgery, and other therapies that are now used to alleviate mental and  physical suffering. Along with nutrition and exercise, mind/body  approaches can be part of self-care practices that could save millions  of dollars annually in medical costs."
