I'm feeling pretty cranky these last couple of days. I picked up whatever R has been walking around with this week. I'm a lousy sick person since I only get sick about once or twice a year in any real way. I'm not used to it like sickly people are...

I'm not horribly ill but achy with an scratchy throat and feeling pretty tired a lot. I've been going to work because it didn't feel bad enough to stay home but my endurance isn't what it should be. I feel like it hasn't made me as tolerant or energetic as I would want to be at work. Twice in the last two days, my boss and I have wound up arguing a bit for things that, in retrospect, seem like relatively minor matters overall.

I'll see how I feel tomorrow but maybe a rest day is in order to patch things up. In any case, I have a bunch of paperwork for myself and then various parties at work that I could do quietly at home for a while. Does that count as a sick day though? hmmm...

On another note, I finished <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0451459733">The Choice of the Cat</a></strong> this evening. As with <strong>The Way of the Wolf</strong>, it was not a deep read in the slightest but easy and fun. I'll probably crack open <strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1405001372">The Cowl</a></strong>
or <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743256700">River of Gods</a></strong> next, since those arrived last week from England but I feel that I should make some progress in my non-fiction reading as well.
