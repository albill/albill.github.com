<p><b>This will probably bore many to tears. Stop reading now.</b></p>

<p>What have I been up to besides causing trouble and getting worked up about my 
roof?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been wondering if I&#39;m working off some sort of karmic debt or have 
pissed off the nagas or something.</p>
<p>As I mentioned to a couple of people, I&#39;d seen other signs (small, 
thankfully) of some water in my laundry room. There was the dried up stain of a 
puddle on the top of a counter in the corner. Directly above it is the main 
cedar beam (exposed) that holds up the floor of the main part of my house. 
Cedar, when water comes off of it, stains, so it made me wonder if the small 
leak in the roof was getting down to there (it&#39;s on the other side of the room 
from where the pipe that the water was dripping on is...). That seemed unlikely.</p>
<p>I did a little experiment after making sure the area was dry and put a 
plastic bag on the counter that would retain water. I figured it might be 
plumbing or another leak and I&#39;d watch for things over time. It rained. Bag is 
dry. We run the bath and the shower. Bag is dry. We use the sink in the kitchen 
(directly above). The bag is dry. I run the dishwasher. <i>Bag is under a small 
puddle and six inches of the beam is wet on the surface.</i> It seems that I 
found my water source.</p>
<p>I have a coworker who has owned a few houses and is pretty handy. He&#39;s my dev 
manager and his office is, unfortunately for him, next to mine. I&#39;ve been 
getting advice from him so I brought this one up. It turns out that he&#39;s had 
this same problem at least twice. In his cases, it was a cracked washer motor 
leaking water and, the other time, a broken drain hose. He told me how I should 
be able to pull the dishwasher out. Hello, next project.</p>
<p>At least it isn&#39;t a roof leak and it isn&#39;t something like water going there 
every time I use the sink.</p>
<p>I suppose all of these things are the wake up call to do a bunch of work over 
time on the house. We did find out that our insulation really sucks in this 
process (all the climbing in the crawlspace) so I&#39;ll probably be personally 
installing rolls of it over the winter. That ought to have a good effect on the 
house.</p>
<p>I&#39;m having the tree that drops leaves and berries on my roof removed in the 
next month or so as well. After that, I need to start seeing about getting the 
old hole from the pool properly filled in and work on the backyard drainage.</p>
