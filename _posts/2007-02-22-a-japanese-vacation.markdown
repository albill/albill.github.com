My wife and I are planning out our next vacation, at least loosely. This
probably won't occur until sometime in Fall but we try to take a trip
together every year. Last Fall, we went on a short trip to Mexico to see
the ruins in the Yucatan and sit on a beach. The year before, we went to
Thailand for a couple of weeks. For this coming year, we're planning on
going to Japan. I've always wanted to see it, having grown up with a
mother that was a bit of a Nipponophile and watching Kurosawa films.
There are a few places that I know that I want to go, such as some of
the famous temple sites near Kyoto but I'm pretty open beyond that. If
anyone has any suggestions, especially for someone with a connection to
Japanese Buddhism, please feel free to let me know. I'd love to know
what people have really enjoyed in visiting Japan.
