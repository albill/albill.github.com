R and I are going to be going to Thailand at the end of September. This is in celebration of our first anniversary as a married couple. We had been planning on going to New Orleans but I wasn't feeling jazzed about it. We had been talking about going to Thailand off and on since last year. So, I went out on a limb and said "Why don't we just go to Thailand for a week or two instead?!" and she agreed! We're doing a week tour with <a href="http://www.intrepidtravel.com/">Intrepid Travel</a> in northern Thailand. We'll come back from that on a Sunday and be leaving Bangkok the following Friday so we'll get some time in the big city and surrounding areas as well.
