R and I had dinner with a childhood friend of hers the other night. Rachael (Rachel?) went to high school with R but has worked for the State Department for a number of years (at least a decade, I believe). When we went to Greece in 2003, we stayed with her in Athens as she was attached to the embassy there.

She's been in town visiting family. Out of R's old friends, she's probably the one I like the most. She's crass, vulgar, and tells off color stories in an amusing way. I like that. Apparently, she used to be over the top that way but has become much more...diplomatic...over the years. Still, she had some screamers that she got into conversation over dinner.

It is too bad that she's not around more often.
