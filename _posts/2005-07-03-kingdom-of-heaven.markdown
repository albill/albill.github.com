<p>R and I went to see <b>Kingdom of Heaven</b> at the local discount theatre 
with Denny Sargent and Sophia last night. It&#39;s kind of funny but they are 
probably the friends that we hang out with the most at this point. They are 
really good people and do a lot of stuff that R and I don&#39;t seem to get around 
to doing, like the ceramics that they do for art and as a magical act. It&#39;s nice 
stuff and very interesting. It&#39;s also different hanging out with people that are 
nearly 20 years older than us. Priorities are a bit different and that might be 
a good thing.</p>
<p>Denny is a kind and mellow guy and I like hanging out with someone who is 
more than happy to deflate my ego if it gets too big and is cool about it. It&#39;s 
hard to get irritated at someone who is that easy going and he knows his stuff. 
I&#39;ve found that I have much more difficulty when people try to play &quot;head on 
train&quot; with me, which happens at work sometimes. We just wind up escalating back 
and forth. I&#39;ve really enjoyed the spiritual work that we do together as a 
group. It&#39;s nice to just do workings where it doesn&#39;t feel like anyone has 
anything to prove or that people are kind of figuring their way in the dark.</p>
<p>As to the movie, I would say it was ok but not great. Visually, it was nice 
but the plot line was a bit predictable (or, rather, highly predictable) and I 
don&#39;t buy the tenth century French blacksmith who can read and write, fight off 
a siege and handle suddenly being made into nobility while going to Jerusalem. 
The suspension of disbelief required is high.</p>
<p>As a number of people have said, the portrayal of Saladin is kind of cool and 
some of the differences between Islamic and Christian culture of the time are 
shown (but not really shown in detail). I always find it amazingly puzzingly and 
even troubling that Islamic culture in the Middle East could have gone from the 
bastion of relatively advanced philosophy, engineering, and overall civilization 
to becoming the backwater of the world in roughly six hundred or so years while 
Europe, in some sense, reversed this. Traditionally, the Muslims were much more 
tolerant of other peoples than the Christians ever have been. They&#39;ve slid far 
and it is rather sad because it can happen to any culture. What&#39;s even worse, 
most of my countrymen will never know anything about their great culture and 
just see terrorists when they see Muslims.</p>
