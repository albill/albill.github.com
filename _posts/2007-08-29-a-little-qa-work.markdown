We've been having heat issues with some of our Mac Minis that are used for automation and stress testing in the QA lab here at Mozilla. We're doing a revamp of our QA lab space right now and moving things around so Tony decided to "fix" the heat problem. It turns out that the main problem with the older Mac Minis is caused by poor air circulation. Sometimes turning them on the side works but it wasn't helping. Tony's solution is up on the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/MozillaQualityAssurance:Home_Page:qamini_redefined">QA wiki</a>. <p align="center">
