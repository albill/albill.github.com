<p>Rain, rain, rain. The weather feels almost normal in Seattle again. </p>
<p>R and I had a relatively lazy day at home. After we got up, she went out to 
the gym while the cleaners did their monthly cleaning of our upstairs. It&#39;s so 
yuppie in a way but it makes a big difference in the house. Since we both work, 
I don&#39;t feel too bad paying for a couple of hours of work every month.</p>
<p>I&#39;m doing the reading for my next philosophy paper. I turned in my history 
paper (more historical theory) this week. After the paper is done for 
philosophy, I&#39;m clear until April 22, when my final papers for each class are 
due. I&#39;m looking forward to the history one since I got to choose the book that 
I&#39;m using.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still trying to figure out whether I need to do the History track, the 
Philosophy track, or the Interdisciplinary track. My interests seem to be 
sitting solidly on Western Esotericism, particularly Masonry and esoteric 
offshoots of the Freemasons. I don&#39;t have a specific topic yet. Given the past 
(or non-current) nature of much of this, I figure that History is the best bet. 
I&#39;m not completely certain and, so far, the head of the program, who is my 
history professor right now, hasn&#39;t replied to my e-mail about the matter. </p>
<p>My philosophy prof seems to to think highly of me. We&#39;ve had some decently 
long e-mail conversations back and forth and he offered to advise my thesis but 
only if I focus it into areas where he is able to help and having certain 
historical requirements from him. He doesn&#39;t want a general history of a group 
or the like. He wants a focused problem that includes, for example, a fraternal 
order. His specific example was the Ku Klux Klan moving into a particular state 
at the end of the 19th century and the problems this raised and the way the 
group had to adjust itself there. (He apparently has done research on the KKK).</p>
<p>I did find out today that two offshoots of Waite&#39;s Golden Dawn survive into 
the current period. These are the &quot;Magickal Order of the Golden Dawn&quot; and the 
&quot;Esoteric Order of the Golden Dawn&quot; (with the former being an offshoot of the 
latter).</p>
<p>I think Waite&#39;s Golden Dawn survives as well, which is too bad because it 
might make a good research topic. I believe I heard that R.A. Gilbert was head 
of it at one point but I&#39;m not sure.</p>
<p>Tonight, R and I went out to dinner and picked up a couple of movies. We 
bought the director&#39;s cut of Donnie Darko, Dr. Strangelove, and the Princess 
Bride. The first is a joint decision, the second was mine, and the third was 
hers. </p>
