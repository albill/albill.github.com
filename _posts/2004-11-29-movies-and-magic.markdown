<p>The last week with the long weekend has been the weekend of many movies. 
Along with Netflix movies, R and I rented a couple and then I bought a few. </p>
<p>Last night, we watched <b>Dawn of the Dead</b>, which was a bit of a dog. 
Now, I like a bad zombie movie as much as the next guy but while parts of it 
were engaging, the movie as a whole was utterly predictable. I was hoping for a 
bit better but I expected it to be as such. We also watched <b>Envy</b> with Ben 
Stiller and Jack Black (plus Christoper &quot;I&#39;m fuckin&#39; creepy&quot; Walken). That one 
was a bit better and typical Stiller and Black type shenanigans. Again, not a 
deep movie but I was simply hoping for funny. Jack Black always makes me laugh.</p>
<p>Tonight, we watched <b>The Unforgiven</b>, which I bought yesterday (along 
with <b>The Outlaw Josey Wales</b> and <b>Pale Rider</b>). As you can imagine, 
I&#39;m a bit of a Clint Eastwood Western fan. I hadn&#39;t seen it in years and I still 
loved the moodiness and just general desperation of the terribly flawed 
characters. I can&#39;t think of a simple &quot;pure&quot; character in the whole movie unless 
it is the children. Unlike the old Westerns, everyone in this movie is messed 
up. As Clint says &quot;We&#39;ve all got it coming.&quot; </p>
<p>Watching him also reminded me that I need to pick up the rest of the <b>Dark 
Tower</b> books again soon. Roland calls. Maybe over the holidays.</p>
<p>Tonight, I&#39;m reading <b>A Year in Linear City</b>, a novella by Paul Di 
Filippo, in the collection, <b>Cities</b>. <b>The Tain</b> by China Mieville is 
in it as well, which is actually why I got it. As it turns out, all of the 
authors that contributed to it are ones that I like.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also been working through Stephenson&#39;s <b>The Confusion</b> and have 
gotten far enough that I understand the basis of the name (and I&#39;m not meaning 
that as a joke). Stephenson continues to give me laugh-out-loud moments when I 
read it though some of it seems to fall flat when I try to explain why it is so 
funny to the missus.</p>
<p>I am also reading some of Mark Stavish&#39;s essays, including one on compassion 
and the Western Esoteric Tradition. He draws comparisons with the Tantric 
tradition and the Bodhisattvas for contrast. Mark and I have been corresponding 
a bit in the last few days and exchanging some thoughts on the Western Estoteric 
Tradition. Inevitably, my involvement with Tantric Buddhism comes up in the 
conversation and the needs that it fulfils that I don&#39;t get in &quot;my own&quot; native 
tradition. He has some interesting thoughts and insights here and seems pretty 
well informed. We&#39;ve had a discussion relating the Inner Heat yoga from Naropa 
to some of Mark&#39;s ideas around the Middle Pillar ritual. Interesting.</p>
<p>I also updated the stylesheet on <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/stavish/">
his website</a> on the <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/">Hermetic Library</a> 
as the old one was just making me wince. It seemed nice six or seven years ago 
when I wrote it.</p>
