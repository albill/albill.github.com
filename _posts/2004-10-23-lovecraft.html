<p>I just found out that Open Circle Theatre is presenting more Lovecraftian 
horror in their live show. Last year, R and I went and saw their production of 
three short pieces (with puppets!), which included the Color out of Space.</p>
<p>This year, they are performing three short pieces again as part of a show: 
Nyarlathotep, The Doom that Came to Sarnath, and Dreams in the Witch House.</p>
<p>I&#39;d go tonight except R has been ill since we got back from our trip.</p>
