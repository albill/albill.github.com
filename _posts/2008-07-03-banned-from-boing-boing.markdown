*This was posted here yesterday. I took it down after a few hours
because I wasn't sure the the proper intent was behind it and that it
simply didn't add fuel to the fire. After receiving a couple of e-mails
about it from people who saw it (here or on feeds) and then saw it was
gone, I'm going to put it back up with this note. It is important to
note that I have been quite a fan of Boing Boing over time and have
generally believed that they were doing all of the "right" things when
it came to blogging and documenting the state of things on the net,
especially the battles over copyright and the like. That is part of what
has been this whole issue so much of a lightning rod for people,
including me. We thought that Boing Boing was better than this sort of
thing and feel a bit let down.* There has been an Internet “tempest in a
teapot” during the last few days over at [Boing
Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/), the well known group blog that
includes Cory Doctorow. (For those that don’t know it…) This has to do
with San Francisco sex blogger and columnist [Violet
Blue](http://www.tinynibbles.com/index.php) noticing that all references
to her have been removed from the blog. This is over 70 references
according to her and go back several years in posts that mentioned her
blogging or writing. For the first day or so, Boing Boing ignored this,
seemingly pretending nothing was happening. Any questions about it in
comments on posts were quickly deleted (I had this done to me). Only
after the Los Angeles Times and other high profile outlets started
asking questions ([Valleywag](http://www.valleywag.com/) doesn’t count)
did they [make a post publicly mentioning
it](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/07/01/that-violet-blue-thi.html) but
they still refuse to say why they did it. That post has now, I believe,
turned into the most commented post ever on Boing Boing. In the midst of
all of this, Teresa Nielsen Hayden, the paid moderator for Boing Boing,
and the commentors started going at it hammer and tongs with Teresa
insulting people (later deleting or editing many of these) and deleting
comments left and right when she didn’t like this. I pointed out the
following earlier:

[![boingboing-comment](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3111/2634733006_0ac71e953c.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/2634733006/ "boingboing-comment by albill, on Flickr")

and I now find myself (and my IP address even) banned from posting
comments on the blog. No official explanation or notice was given, my
ability to post comments now simply returns “An error occurred:
Permission denied.” from the posting script and attempts to make a new
account to post tells me that my IP address has been banned. Hmm… I
would think a warning or even an e-mail would be in order? I don’t blame
the core Boing Boing writers for this sort of behavior but it does make
me question the “moderation” of their paid moderating staff who attack
the very community, with some rather unfriendly and confrontational
language, after inviting that same community to comment on the post
about the larger issue. Somehow, I doubt if I’ll be submitting too many
more links to Boing Boing in the future. This is too bad as I was quite
happy to see on of my posts on their front page a little over a week
ago. **Update:** I’ve had e-mail with Cory, who is on vacation and, I
guess, staying away from the mess which is Boing Boing on this whole
issue. He said that there is no reason why my IP address would be
blocked and CC’d Teresa on his response. She has unblocked it (which she
said was the fault of an assistant moderator who “is still a little
shaky on IP addresses”). No word from her, in response to a direct
question, about my seeming banning with no notice or explanation so I
expect that I still won’t be participating on their site anymore. I’m
still receiving an error message any time I attempt to leave a comment
on any Boing Boing post. I did appreciate the following comment posted
by “[Lizzle](http://www.gastronomydomine.com/)” near the end of the
giant ass thread in respond to one of the true believers. She reiterates
the issue that I touched above to how the “moderation” by Teresa, who is
paid to moderate Boing Boing, affects the readers and, therefore, the
overall community on the blog:

I must also add this limerick, found on
[metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/72928/Boing-Boing-Finds-21st-Century-Trotsky#2167462),
which seems to sum things up nicely:

**Update for 7/3:** Teresa responded after two e-mails on the issue (the
second one after 24 hours or so) and she cc'd the entire Boing Boing
staff. In response to my stating that her lack of response after a day
was just fodder for the blog, she stated "You're now threatening me and
Boing Boing because you didn't get your answer instantly? That'll play
well." My immediate reaction to this kind of thing is "And they pay you
to actually *moderate* a public blog site?" Wow. I didn't realize
pointing out that this kind of thing is blog fodder was a "threat" (and
not just to her but to ALL of Boing Boing!). I mean, seriously, when I'm
bitching about being banned on Boing Boing, the fact that the moderator,
after responding on one issue, then blows me off for a day is likely to
wind up being mentioned here. It looked pretty willful to me since she
responded within ten minutes on the other issue when Cory e-mailed her.
