How much longer will we allow our government to do those things that we
know, if we search our hearts, are wrong? America was built on a dream
of equality, justice, or freedom that never really existed but which we
believed in and which many people gave blood, sweat, and tears, even
their own lives, to serve. We have a belief in justice and rightness
along with the inherent rights and dignity of our fellows as well as
ourselves. It is **EVIL**, as much as anything can be, that while giving
lip service to serving this tradition, our leaders pervert our ideals
for short-sighted goals and naked power. How long will we tolerate these
acts of inhumanity? From the Los Angels Times, an [excerpt from a
letter](http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-dossari11jan11,0,3342644.story?coll=la-home-commentary)
by Gitmo detainee (one of our "terrorist enemies), [Jumah
al-Dossari](http://web.amnesty.org/pages/stoptorture-bahrainicase1-eng):

This brings tears to my eyes. This injustice needs to stop. We need to
remember who we are, as a people, and the dignity of men.
