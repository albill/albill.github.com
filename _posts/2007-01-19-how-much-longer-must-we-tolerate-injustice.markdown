How much longer will we allow our government to do those things that we know, if we search our hearts, are wrong?

America was built on a dream of equality, justice, or freedom that never really existed but which we believed in and which many people gave blood, sweat, and tears, even their own lives, to serve. We have a belief in justice and rightness along with the inherent rights and dignity of our fellows as well as ourselves.

It is <strong>EVIL</strong>, as much as anything can be, that while giving lip service to serving this tradition, our leaders pervert our ideals for short-sighted goals and naked power.

How long will we tolerate these acts of inhumanity?

From the Los Angels Times, an <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-dossari11jan11,0,3342644.story?coll=la-home-commentary">excerpt from a letter</a> by Gitmo detainee (one of our "terrorist enemies), <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/pages/stoptorture-bahrainicase1-eng">Jumah al-Dossari</a>:
<blockquote>I would rather die than stay here forever, and I have tried to commit suicide many times. The purpose of Guantanamo is to destroy people, and I have been destroyed. I am hopeless because our voices are not heard from the depths of the detention center.

If I die, please remember that there was a human being named Jumah at Guantanamo whose beliefs, dignity and humanity were abused. Please remember that there are hundreds of detainees at Guantanamo suffering the same misfortune. They have not been charged with any crimes. They have not been accused of taking any action against the United States.</blockquote>
This brings tears to my eyes. This injustice needs to stop. We need to remember who we are, as a people, and the dignity of men.
