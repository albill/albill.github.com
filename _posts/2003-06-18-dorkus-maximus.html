So, I went to Latin 103 tonight. I scoped out the new building in Fremont, went and got some food, and then went to the coffe shop to study for a while and review old chapters. At the appointed time, I go into the school and look at the board to figure out where my class is meeting. A couple of staff members look at me and say "Are you here for a class?" I say, "Yep, Latin 103." They then say, "Class doesn&apos;t start until Thursday..."

 <b>Doh!</b>

 So much for reading the calendar correctly.

 What makes this extremely dorky is that I did the exact same thing last quarter too...
