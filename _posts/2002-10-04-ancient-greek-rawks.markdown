Oh, how I'd forgotten the joys of the Greek alphabet. Well, no more! I had my first Ancient Greek class tonight, one down and something like 79 to go. ;-) (That's just the first year though.) It's a fairly small class. There are twelve people in it. That's the good aspect of it. Of course, there won't be a 102 or 103 class if too many drop out and we get below minimum size. About two-thirds of the class seems to be taking it so they can go to Grad school or for similar academic reasons. That puts them in the same boat as me and I hope it means that they'll keep taking it. The oldest member of the class is a retired woman who already has a PhD in something. She's just decided that Greek shouldn't be so hard after all. I hope I'm that flexible when I'm older. I need to find some reading materials that are simple enough to work with that in another quarter or two I can start pushing myself at them. I'm not going to do the New Testament (unless someone tells me to) since it is Koine and that is a later dialect than the Attic that I'm learning. In another news, I've offered to take over <a href="http://www.beastbay.com">beastbay.com</a> as a news site. We'll see if that happens. It's a bit dead (looks alive but it is undead) right now.
