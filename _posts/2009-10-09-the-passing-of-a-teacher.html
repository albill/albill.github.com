<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/albill/3995520223/" title="John Daido Loori"><img align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3514/3995520223_b0200a3566_o.jpg" border="1" width="220" height="239" alt="John Daido Loori" /></a> John Daido Loori, the general abbot of the <a href="http://www.mro.org/">Mountains and Rivers Order</a> (MRO) and Zen Mountain Monastery in New York, <a href="http://www.shambhalasun.com/news/?p=6307">died today</a>. 

Bernie Glassman wrote a <a href="http://www.shambhalasun.com/news/?p=6312">tribute</a> on his Dharma brother's passing today that is worth reading.

I know that he has had a remarkable effect and been an influence on many many Buddhists in America, Zen or otherwise. I know that his writings have affected me greatly and I feel a bit of sadness at his passing, as natural as it is for all of us.

I ask people to pause and reflect on him and then their own lives, this very moment with the passing of this great American teacher and leader.

<strong>Update</strong>: I enjoyed <a href="http://zendirtzendust.blogspot.com/2009/10/meditation-on-death-zombies-and-buddhas.html">this entry</a> at Sweep the dust, push the dirt. The part below especially stuck with me as a practitioner:

<ol><li>I am of the nature to grow old. There is no way to escape growing old.
<li>I am of the nature to have ill health. There is no way to escape ill health.
<li>I am of the nature to die. There is no way to escape death.
<li>All that is dear to me and everyone I love are of the nature to change. There is no way to escape being separated from them.
<li>My actions are my only true belongings. I cannot escape the consequences of my actions. My actions are the ground upon which I stand. </ol>
