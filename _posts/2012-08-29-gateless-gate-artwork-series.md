I just came across this the other day. A artist named "Mark Morse" is doing a series of images of the entire Gateless Gate koan collection and putting them up online at [gatelessgate.com](http://www.thegatelessgate.com). Mark [admits](http://www.thegatelessgate.com/about/) to the meditative side of working with the collection being a mystery but is inspired by the stories and the imagery in them. He's going to do an image of each koan with one new drawing added every week. He's also been narrating them and adding them to his [Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/mtmorse) as well. 

Here is an example of his images. This is for "Case 2: Hyakujoâ€™s Fox."

Mark told me over e-mail that he'll eventually have an Etsy store set up so people can buy his images but his main priority right now is just making the images, which is taking all of his free time.

I really encourage people to go check out his site, especially Zen practitioners.
