I am told that a laundry truck hit the transformer for the hotel around 6:00 AM. ("They're getting closer!" was said by someone.) We're on battery power, which is good for ten hours or so. Luckily, they estimate that the power will be fixed in "five hours" but I'm not sure what that is in metric.

It was not seen if the driver of the truck was a Microsoft employee or a bear. I'm afraid to get on the gondola to go to the mountaintop for the big dinner tonight though.

Strangely enough, even though I have no power in my room, the wifi in the hotel still has power...
