<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baker_Aitken">Robert Aitken Roshi</a> is one of the earliest Western teachers of Zen still alive today. He was exposed to Zen while in a Japanese internment camp in Kobe, Japan after being captured as a worker in Guam. Following the war, he went on to study in America and then in Japan before returning to the States. He has been teaching here in the West continually for 50 years now. I've read a number of his books and have learned a lot from them. 

Aitken Roshi has been sick for a number of years now, suffering a stroke a few years ago. While he isn't destitute, he does require round the clock care. I read today that he's been diagnosed with Parkinson's recently but has been active in his sangha in spite of his illness. Because of his care requirements, there has been a general call to the Buddhist community for support and financial help for Aitken Roshi, a man who has given his life to the Dharma. He is not going to be able to afford the care on his own for very long and there is no retirement plan for Zen masters. 

I've donated to help and I would encourage others to consider doing the same as well. You can find out more information, as well as give donatations, at <a href="http://www.aitkenroshi.org">http://www.aitkenroshi.org</a>.
