The Heart of Prajñā Pāramitā Sutra, known as the Heart Sutra, is the one of the most succinct and important texts in Buddhism. It is recited daily by Buddhists around the world as encapsulating the essence of Buddhism. I am posting it here because I've been reading Red Pine's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593760825"><strong>The Heart Sutra</strong></a>. As he says in his book, "The Heart Sutra is Buddhism in a nutshell. It covers more of the Buddha's teachings in a shorter span than any other scripture, and it does so without being superficial or commonplace."

Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, while deeply immersed in prajñā pāramitā, clearly perceived the empty nature of the five skandhas, and transcended all suffering.

Śariputra! Form is not different from emptiness, emptiness is not different from form. Form is emptiness, emptiness is form. So it is with feeling, conception, volition, and consciousness.

Śariputra! All dharmas are empty in character; neither arising nor ceasing, neither impure nor pure, neither increasing nor decreasing.

Therefore, in emptiness, there is no form; there is no feeling, conception, volition, or consciousness; no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind; no form, sound, smell, taste, touch, or dharmas; no realm of vision, and so forth, up to no realm of mind-consciousness; no ignorance or ending of ignorance, and so forth, up to no aging and death or ending of aging and death. There is no suffering, no cause, no extinction, no path. There is no wisdom and no attainment. There is nothing to be attained.

By way of prajñā pāramitā, the bodhisattva’s mind is free from hindrances. With no hindrances, there is no fear; freed from all distortion and delusion, ultimate nirvana is reached.

By way of prajñā pāramitā, Buddhas of the past, present, and future attain anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.

Therefore, prajñā pāramitā is the great powerful mantra, the great enlightening mantra, the supreme and peerless mantra. It can remove all suffering. This is the truth beyond all doubt. And the prajñā pāramitā mantra is spoken thus:

<em>Gate gate pāragate pārasamgate bodhi svāhā.</em>
