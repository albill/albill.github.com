Last night, R and I went to an event at a small art space in Alameda.
Our friend, David Baker, was opening for another friend of his, Chris.
Chris had just released a CD of his piano music and was going to play a
bit of it. A year ago that day, in the same space, Dave had released his
own CD of music. Dave has been a friend of R's since they met when she
was in high school locally. She worked at Rasputin's (a record shop of
some reknown locally) and he at Tower Records. She wound up hanging out
with him and his friends, who had a goth band, watching them play and
otherwise having a good time. Twenty years later, she still knows him
and he's still doing music (Chris was in the band as well). Dave lived
in Japan for a few years, met a nice woman there, and then came back to
the states for the last couple of years. He's returning to Japan in just
over a week to take a teaching job and to be with his girlfriend.
They're hoping to marry and he's planning on staying over there. It is
good for him but a little sad for us because he was one of those people
that we just enjoyed hanging out with on occasion and he's an excellent
guy. He's also fluent in Japanese, having gone to Cal as a late student
and gotten a degree and I'd been hoping to have him help tutor me over
the next year. Good luck, Dave! Here is a slightly shaky piece of
recording from him playing part of "Echoes from Kuji" last night. If you
go to Vimeo, you can watch it in HD. This is one of my favorite songs
that he's done. \
