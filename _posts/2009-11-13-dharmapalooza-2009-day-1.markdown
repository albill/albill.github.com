I visited my mom in Salt Lake City for a couple of days this week before
coming here to Boulder, Colorado. I'm here to attended "[Dharmapalooza
2009](http://www.stuartdavis.com/blog/dharmapalooza-2009)," having won a
free ticket from the [Buddhist Geeks](http://www.buddhistgeeks.com)
during a giveaway on Twitter. The event is a combination of a Zen site
with [Jun Po Roshi](http://www.mondozen.org/) of Mondo Zen and the
Hollow Bones Order with a concert by [Stuart
Davis](http://www.stuartdavis.com/). Given Davis' connection with Zen,
it makes a bit of sense and this is the fifth Dharmapalooza that he has
organized. Today, we did a short sit with Jun Po with some discussion on
his approach to Zen and the meditation method that he wanted to use
during the all day session tomorrow. He seems to be following an
approach that embraces the somatic, body centered methods, as well as
some of the "voices" therapeutic techniques. We'll see how that works in
practice. While his methods are outside the common ones that we find in
Zen, I did get a sense that he is fairly serious and solid (he didn't
come off as terribly fringe) and I liked what I experienced of him. I
did not previously realize that he was the "Mondo Zen" guy, who I had
heard interviewed a while back on Buddhist Geeks (see [part
1](http://personallifemedia.com/podcasts/236-buddhist-geeks/episodes/22120-psychotropics-neurolinguistic)
and [part
2](http://personallifemedia.com/podcasts/236-buddhist-geeks/episodes/22121-hollow-bones)).
After the sit, we all went out to dinner together at a nearby Himalayan
restaurant. I got to finally meet Ryan and Vince of Buddhist Geeks
(though Vince is doing it out on his own now) after all of these years
of talking to them online. I also got a chance to talk to Stuart Davis
for a bit. I told him about how before our last Zen retreat, those of us
attending the retreat had sat down to watch his "[Zen and the Zen of
Zen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juElohSYUiM)" video, which led to
many inappropriate jokes and thoughts during the retreat, itself. Stuart
had the high point of hilarity of the evening when we all sat down as a
group to sit. With a loud and fairly distinctive sound, he managed to
rip his tight rocker jeans from thigh to crotch when he sat down on the
cushion, which he freely announced to those who had missed it. He
muttered some comments about calling it the "wormhole" when we were at
dinner. So far, a fun event. I'm looking forward to tomorrow though my
back and neck are already aching at the thought of it. Jun Po is
definitely of the school of Zen thought that says to suck up the pain of
sitting and not move at all. We'll see how that goes.
