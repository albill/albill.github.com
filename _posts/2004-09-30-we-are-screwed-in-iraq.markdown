<p>This is from <a href="http://www.boingboing.net">BoingBoing</a> Blog:<br>

Farnaz Fassihi, a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> correspondent in Iraq, confirmed 
that a widely-redistributed letter she emailed to friends about the nightmarish 
situation in Iraq was indeed written by her. Too bad the WSJ doesn&#39;t allow this 
reporter to write these kinds of stories for the paper.<br>

Being a foreign correspondent in Baghdad these days is like being under virtual 
house arrest. Forget about the reasons that lured me to this job: a chance to 
see the world, explore the exotic, meet new people in far away lands, discover 
their ways and tell stories that could make a difference.</p>
<p>Little by little, day-by-day, being based in Iraq has defied all those 
reasons. I am house bound. I leave when I have a very good reason to and a 
scheduled interview. I avoid going to people&#39;s homes and never walk in the 
streets. I can&#39;t go grocery shopping any more, can&#39;t eat in restaurants, can&#39;t 
strike a conversation with strangers, can&#39;t look for stories, can&#39;t drive in any 
thing but a full armored car, can&#39;t go to scenes of breaking news stories, can&#39;t 
be stuck in traffic, can&#39;t speak English outside, can&#39;t take a road trip, can&#39;t 
say I&#39;m an American, can&#39;t linger at checkpoints, can&#39;t be curious about what 
people are saying, doing, feeling. And can&#39;t and can&#39;t.</p>
<p>There has been one too many close calls, including a car bomb so near our 
house that it blew out all the windows. So now my most pressing concern every 
day is not to write a kick-ass story but to stay alive and make sure our Iraqi 
employees stay alive. In Baghdad I am a security personnel first, a reporter 
second.</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to pinpoint when the turning point exactly began. Was it April when 
the Fallujah fell out of the grasp of the Americans? Was it when Moqtada and 
Jish Mahdi declared war on the U.S. military? Was it when Sadr City, home to ten 
percent of Iraq&#39;s population, became a nightly battlefield for the Americans? Or 
was it when the insurgency began spreading from isolated pockets in the Sunni 
triangle to include most of Iraq? Despite President Bush&#39;s rosy assessments, 
Iraq remains a disaster. If under Saddam it was a potential threat, under the 
Americans it has been transformed to imminent and active threat, a foreign 
policy failure bound to haunt the United States for decades to come.</p>

<p>Iraqis like to call this mess the situation. When asked how are things? they 
reply: the situation is very bad.</p>
<p>What they mean by situation is this: the Iraqi government doesn&#39;t control 
most Iraqi cities, there are several car bombs going off each day around the 
country killing and injuring scores of innocent people, the country&#39;s roads are 
becoming impassable and littered by hundreds of landmines and explosive devices 
aimed to kill American soldiers, there are assassinations, kidnappings and 
beheadings. The situation, basically, means a raging barbaric guerilla war.</p>
<p>In four days, 110 people died and over 300 got injured in Baghdad alone. The 
numbers are so shocking that the ministry of health, which was attempting an 
exercise of public transparency by releasing the numbers-- has now stopped 
disclosing them.</p>
<p>Insurgents now attack Americans 87 times a day.</p>
<p>A friend drove thru the Shiite slum of Sadr City yesterday. He said young men 
were openly placing improvised explosive devices into the ground. They melt a 
shallow hole into the asphalt, dig the explosive, cover it with dirt and put an 
old tire or plastic can over it to signal to the locals this is booby-trapped. 
He said on the main roads of Sadr City, there were a dozen landmines per every 
ten yards. His car snaked and swirled to avoid driving over them. Behind the 
walls sits an angry Iraqi ready to detonate them as soon as an American convoy 
gets near. This is in Shiite land, the population that was supposed to love 
America for liberating Iraq.</p>
<p>For journalists the significant turning point came with the wave of abduction 
and kidnappings. Only two weeks ago we felt safe around Baghdad because 
foreigners were being abducted on the roads and highways between towns. Then 
came a frantic phone call from a journalist female friend at 11 p.m. telling me 
two Italian women had been abducted from their homes in broad daylight. Then the 
two Americans, who got beheaded this week and the Brit, were abducted from their 
homes in a residential neighborhood. They were supplying the entire block with 
round the clock electricity from their generator to win friends. The abductors 
grabbed one of them at 6 a.m. when he came out to switch on the generator; his 
beheaded body was thrown back near the neighborhoods. The insurgency, we are 
told, is rampant with no signs of calming down. If any thing, it is growing 
stronger, organized and more sophisticated every day. The various elements 
within it -- baathists, criminals, nationalists and Al Qaeda -- are cooperating 
and coordinating.</p>
<p>I went to an emergency meeting for foreign correspondents with the military 
and embassy to discuss the kidnappings. We were somberly told our fate would 
largely depend on where we were in the kidnapping chain once it was determined 
we were missing. Here is how it goes: criminal gangs grab you and sell you up to 
Baathists in Fallujah, who will in turn sell you to Al Qaeda. In turn, cash and 
weapons flow the other way from Al Qaeda to the Baathisst to the criminals. My 
friend Georges, the French journalist snatched on the road to Najaf, has been 
missing for a month with no word on release or whether he is still alive.</p>
<p>America&#39;s last hope for a quick exit? The Iraqi police and National Guard 
units we are spending billions of dollars to train. The cops are being murdered 
by the dozens every day, over 700 to date -- and the insurgents are infiltrating 
their ranks. The problem is so serious that the U.S. military has allocated $6 
million dollars to buy out 30,000 cops they just trained to get rid of them 
quietly.</p>
<p>As for reconstruction: firstly it&#39;s so unsafe for foreigners to operate that 
almost all projects have come to a halt. After two years, of the $18 billion 
Congress appropriated for Iraq reconstruction only about $1 billion or so has 
been spent and a chuck has now been reallocated for improving security, a sign 
of just how bad things are going here.</p>
<p>Oil dreams? Insurgents disrupt oil flow routinely as a result of sabotage and 
oil prices have hit record high of $49 a barrel.</p>
<p>Who did this war exactly benefit? Was it worth it? Are we safer because 
Saddam is holed up and Al Qaeda is running around in Iraq?</p>
<p>Iraqis say that thanks to America they got freedom in exchange for 
insecurity. Guess what? They say they&#39;d take security over freedom any day, even 
if it means having a dictator ruler.</p>
<p>I heard an educated Iraqi say today that if Saddam Hussein were allowed to 
run for elections he would get the majority of the vote. This is truly sad.</p>
<p>Then I went to see an Iraqi scholar this week to talk to him about elections 
here. He has been trying to educate the public on the importance of voting. He 
said, &quot;President Bush wanted to turn Iraq into a democracy that would be an 
example for the Middle East. Forget about democracy, forget about being a model 
for the region, we have to salvage Iraq before all is lost.&quot;</p>
<p>One could argue that Iraq is already lost beyond salvation. For those of us 
on the ground it&#39;s hard to imagine what if any thing could salvage it from its 
violent downward spiral.</p>
<p>The genie of terrorism, chaos and mayhem has been unleashed onto this country 
as a result of American mistakes and it can&#39;t be put back into a bottle.</p>
<p>The Iraqi government is talking about having elections in three months while 
half of the country remains a no go zone -- out of the hands of the government 
and the Americans and out of reach of journalists. In the other half, the 
disenchanted population is too terrified to show up at polling stations. The 
Sunnis have already said they&#39;d boycott elections, leaving the stage open for 
polarized government of Kurds and Shiites that will not be deemed as legitimate 
and will most certainly lead to civil war.</p>
<p>I asked a 28-year-old engineer if he and his family would participate in the 
Iraqi elections since it was the first time Iraqis could to some degree elect a 
leadership. His response summed it all: &quot;Go and vote and risk being blown into 
pieces or followed by the insurgents and murdered for cooperating with the 
Americans? For what? To practice democracy? Are you joking?&quot;</p>
