My friend Chris died yesterday. He wasn't a close friend. He lived too far away in Los Angeles. 

He and I spent some time time together at various gatherings of the OTO and similar people over the years. We were both initiates of the Rites of Eleusis that have been recreated in California. I enjoyed talking to him. He made me laugh and he was a lot of fun and also had a lot to say.

He was an inspiration for a lot of us. He was someone who had experienced both the highs and lows of life and come out stronger. He had recently entered graduate school and was looking forward to a new career when he was diagnosed with cancer. That was within the last six months. The end came quickly, too quickly for his friends but I suspect that he was ready to go at the end. 

<blockquote>Unto them from whose eyes the veil of life hath fallen may there be granted the accomplishment of their true Wills; whether they will absorption in the Infinite, or to be united with their chosen and preferred, or to be in contemplation, or to be at peace, or to achieve the labour and heroism of incarnation on this planet or another, or in any Star, or aught else, unto them may there be granted the accomplishment of their wills; yea, the accomplishment of their wills.

<b>AUMGN. AUMGN. AUMGN.</b>

So mote it be. </blockquote>
