(This is also the same weekend as our normal playing session, so I expect to see more costuming during our meeting this weekend!)
Nova Albion is the regional steampunk gathering and it is occurring about a mile or so from my home. I plan on posting many photos and notes later on. 
My provisional schedule is below for the local Bay Area people that I know who may also be going to the event. The <a href="http://www.neverwashaul.com/">Neverwas Haul</a> event on Saturday evening is not at the hotel but it about three blocks from my house. It is definitely worth seeing if you haven't been on the Haul before.
