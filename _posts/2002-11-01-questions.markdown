So, I've been pondering proposing to for a while now. Leaving aside the three or so months that we were broken up at the beginning of the year, we've been together two years today (we usually count from our date on Halloween or I do). We're living together now.

I'm thinking of proposing though with the caveat that we not get married for a year or two from now. I don't mind a long engagement with someone I'm living with anyway...

The question is whether to propose now in some fashion or whether I should wait until our trip to Greece in April and propose at Eleusis or something. ;-)

I'm open to opinions even if I ignore them!

<em>This goes without saying but...if any of you tell her and I find out, I will hurt you badly...;-)</em>
