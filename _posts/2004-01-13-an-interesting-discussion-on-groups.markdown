This article focussed on "Phantom Authority" using Wikipedia as an
example. I found it quite insightful and I was also thinking of Occult
groups like the OTO as I read it. **[Phantom authority, selfâ€“selective
recruitment and retention of members in virtual communities: The case of
Wikipedia](http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue8_12/ciffolilli/index.html)**
I have a Wiki functioning on Hermetic.com but I haven't really linked to
it. I've wondered what overarching purpose that I could put it to on the
website.
