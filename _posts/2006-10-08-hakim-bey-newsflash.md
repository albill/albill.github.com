This is a newsflash. Though the knowledge is old news to many, some have not heard before now. I say this as a public service announcement and operator of a very longterm Hakim Bey website (<a href="http://www.hermetic.com/bey/">http://www.hermetic.com/bey/</a>):

<h2>Hakim Bey writes about sex with boys.</h2>

Yes, he does. Worse yet, he used to write (maybe still does?) for NAMBLA's newsletter. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nambla">NAMBLA</a> is the "North American Man/Boy Love Association." This is an organization that advocates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia">pedophilia</a>.



Yes, those references to the creamy thighs of young boys in Bey's writings weren't a fluke and he's written poetry and such about it more than once.



This news came out to many in the 90's but it seems to have bypassed a variety of people. Now you have all gotten the memo.



Now, I heard this and I still maintain the website but then I still find value in Bey's essays and books. Others may differ on this but let's avoid devolving to book burning if we can avoid it.
