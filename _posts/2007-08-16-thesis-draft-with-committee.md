This seems to be the day to post...

I just received confirmation from my thesis mentor that he has received the official draft of my thesis. I mailed this in to my committee on Monday.

At this point, the three of them will read it. If they have issues, they will contact me and I may need to rewrite or change sections. When this is done or if they have no issues, they will sign off on the thesis. At that point, I'll make a copy on high quality paper and send it in to my program. From there on, it will wind its way through the bureaucratic mazes of the university, being examined for margin sizes, the lack of bolded fonts, etc. until it is finally approved. This may take months.

So, assuming no issues, I'll probably be officially graduated during Spring Semester though this Fall is technically possible.
