The <strong>Down to a Science Cafe</strong> <a href="http://www.sciencecafesf.com/">blog</a> has <a href="http://www.sciencecafesf.com/2007/12/03/meditation-cafe-videospics-are-up/">posted a follow-up</a> to the Mindfulness and the Brain presentation that I <a href="http://www.arcanology.com/2007/11/28/mindfulness-and-the-brain-the-neuroscience-of-meditation/">posted about last week</a>.

They have put up video recordings of the entire presentation by Dr. Phillippe Goldin, which you can get <a href="http://www.sciencecafesf.com/past-cafes/meditation/">here</a>. The video is also broken up into twelve pieces, which have been put up on Youtube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=kishorehari">here</a>. I have the first one of the twelve embedded below:

Dr. Goldin also made a number of PDFs available of suggested articles. He mentioned during the presentation that he was going to do this. These are:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.sciencecafesf.com/wp-content/uploads/2003Science_BuddhismNeuroscience.pdf">Article from <em>Science</em> Magazine</a> on meeting of buddhist monks and neuroscientists</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.sciencecafesf.com/wp-content/uploads/MelbourneMindfulnessGroup2006AusNewZelandJPsychi_MBSRreview.pdf">Australian Journal Review Paper</a> on Mindfulness Psychotherapies</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.sciencecafesf.com/wp-content/uploads/Shapiro2006JClinPsychol_MechanimsMindfulness.pdf">Overview of Mindfulness</a> from Journal of Clinical Psychology</li>
	<li>Short Paper on <a href="http://www.sciencecafesf.com/wp-content/uploads/Ochsner2005TICS_cogControlEmotion.pdf">Emotion Regulation</a></li>
	<li>Paper on <a href="http://www.sciencecafesf.com/wp-content/uploads/Williams_MBCTsuicidePrevention_JnClinPsych2006.pdf">Suicide Prevention</a> using Mindfulness</li>
</ul>
I encourage people interested in the current research on meditation techniques, therapy, and neuroscience (and their intersection) to take a look at the articles and to watch the video (if you haven't already heard the podcast). The video has the advantage of showing Dr. Goldin's slides.
