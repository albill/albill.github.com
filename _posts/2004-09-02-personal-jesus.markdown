This evening, a rip of the two tracks from a promo copy of the next
**Marilyn Manson** single came into my hands. It's a cover of **Depeche
Mode**'s "Personal Jesus." This is kind of similar on concept to when
Manson did "Sweet Dreams" a number of years back. Surprisingly (for
some), it's actually not half bad...

I'm not sure when this will be released but I assume it is soon.
