<p>This evening, a rip of the two tracks from a promo copy of the next <b>
Marilyn Manson</b> single came into my hands. It&#39;s a cover of <b>Depeche Mode</b>&#39;s 
&quot;Personal Jesus.&quot; This is kind of similar on concept to when Manson did &quot;Sweet 
Dreams&quot; a number of years back. Surprisingly (for some), it&#39;s actually not half 
bad...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure when this will be released but I assume it is soon.</p>
