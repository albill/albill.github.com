<a href="http://www.thecrucible.org/">The Crucible</a> is having their fire arts festival this weekend. R and I are going to go tomorrow night to see the circus performers at 8:00. I was just reminded that the festival has already started when I heard a thump out the window to my left. When I looked over, I saw a bright ball of fire going up into the sky. Terrorists? No. I live about four blocks from the Crucible with the only thing between us being the elevated BART line. From the top of the loft (in the crow's nest where my computer area is), I can look straight over to it. Tomorrow is going to be fun.
