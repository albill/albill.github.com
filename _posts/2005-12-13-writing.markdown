I feel like I should write more...specifically, that I should write some fiction. I've had various ideas at a variety of points but I've never felt that <i>push</i> to start telling a particular story. I don't know if I'm putting too much emphasis on the idea of writing as a calling instead of it being an interesting thought exercise.

Of course, this doesn't mean that I could plot well, write interesting dialogue or otherwise tell a story anyone would care about. I need to start writing down the random ideas, scenes or settings that occur to me at times.

Aside from this, I do expect to write a non-fiction book or three at some point. I've wandered across too far of a spiritual landscape in America with interesting people not to do so. There is always the Microsoft thing too at some point. I'd write a memoir of BBS culture back before the Internet boom hit but who would care?
