This is from a review of Rudy Rucker's new novel, "Mathematicians in
Love"
[here](http://www.metroactive.com/metro-santa-cruz/01.10.07/rudy-rucker-0702.html).

Thinking of all of the occultists that I know in IT, this seems pretty
spot on to me though I don't know if the object-oriented programming
thing is more than just an excuse. Geeks...
