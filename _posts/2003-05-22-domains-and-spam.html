I&apos;ve had the memoria.com domain since 1996 (I think and I&apos;m too lazy to look). I&apos;m thinking of retiring it, as much as I like it, as I get massive amounts of spam to my domain and it wouldn&apos;t be terribly disruptive since it only hosts my home page. I&apos;m trying to think of a good domain name, probably Latin and somewhat Classical like &apos;memoria&apos; is, to register for my new domain. If anyone has any suggestions that aren&apos;t taken, I&apos;d love to hear them.
