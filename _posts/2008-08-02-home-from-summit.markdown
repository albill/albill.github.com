My plane landed around 6:30 PM locally and I am now back in the Bay Area. After a little mass transit and a dinner out with R, I am home with her and the pets. My large tomcat seems exceedingly happy that I have returned without bears.

I'll be home for most of four days before going off to Las Vegas for the Black Hat and DEFCON security conferences.

I expect that the Mozilla Summit will be an event discussed for years to come with a certain amount of levity regarding some of the events. I found many of the sessions at the summit to be both interesting and thought provoking. I think that I'll have more to say about that when I haven't been awake for roughly 24 hours.
