<h2>Decoded at last: the &#39;classical holy grail&#39; that may rewrite the history of 
the world</h2>
<h3>Scientists begin to unlock the secrets of papyrus scraps bearing long-lost 
words by the literary giants of Greece and Rome</h3>
<h3>By David Keys and Nicholas Pyke</h3>
<h4>17 April 2005</h4>
<p>For more than a century, it has caused excitement and frustration in equal 
measure - a collection of Greek and Roman writings so vast it could redraw the 
map of classical civilization. If only it was legible.</p>
<p>Now, in a breakthrough described as the classical equivalent of finding the 
holy grail, Oxford University scientists have employed infra-red technology to 
open up the hoard, known as the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, and with it the prospect 
that hundreds of lost Greek comedies, tragedies and epic poems will soon be 
revealed.</p>
<p>In the past four days alone, Oxford&#39;s classicists have used it to make a 
series of astonishing discoveries, including writing by Sophocles, Euripides, 
Hesiod and other literary giants of the ancient world, lost for millennia. They 
even believe they are likely to find lost Christian gospels, the originals of 
which were written around the time of the earliest books of the New Testament.</p>
<p>The original papyrus documents, discovered in an ancient rubbish dump in 
central Egypt, are often meaningless to the naked eye - decayed, worm-eaten and 
blackened by the passage of time. But scientists using the new photographic 
technique, developed from satellite imaging, are bringing the original writing 
back into view. Academics have hailed it as a development which could lead to a 
20 per cent increase in the number of great Greek and Roman works in existence. 
Some are even predicting a &quot;second Renaissance&quot;.</p>
<p>Christopher Pelling, Regius Professor of Greek at the University of Oxford, 
described the new works as &quot;central texts which scholars have been speculating 
about for centuries&quot;.</p>
<p>Professor Richard Janko, a leading British scholar, formerly of University 
College London, now head of classics at the University of Michigan, said: 
&quot;Normally we are lucky to get one such find per decade.&quot; One discovery in 
particular, a 30-line passage from the poet Archilocos, of whom only 500 lines 
survive in total, is described as &quot;invaluable&quot; by Dr Peter Jones, author and 
co-founder of the Friends of Classics campaign.</p>
<p>The papyrus fragments were discovered in historic dumps outside the Graeco-Egyptian 
town of Oxyrhynchus (&quot;city of the sharp-nosed fish&quot;) in central Egypt at the end 
of the 19th century. Running to 400,000 fragments, stored in 800 boxes at 
Oxford&#39;s Sackler Library, it is the biggest hoard of classical manuscripts in 
the world.</p>
<p>The previously unknown texts, read for the first time last week, include 
parts of a long-lost tragedy - the Epigonoi (&quot;Progeny&quot;) by the 5th-century BC 
Greek playwright Sophocles; part of a lost novel by the 2nd-century Greek writer 
Lucian; unknown material by Euripides; mythological poetry by the 1st-century BC 
Greek poet Parthenios; work by the 7th-century BC poet Hesiod; and an epic poem 
by Archilochos, a 7th-century successor of Homer, describing events leading up 
to the Trojan War. Additional material from Hesiod, Euripides and Sophocles 
almost certainly await discovery.</p>
<p>Oxford academics have been working alongside infra-red specialists from 
Brigham Young University, Utah. Their operation is likely to increase the number 
of great literary works fully or partially surviving from the ancient Greek 
world by up to a fifth. It could easily double the surviving body of lesser work 
- the pulp fiction and sitcoms of the day.</p>
<p>&quot;The Oxyrhynchus collection is of unparalleled importance - especially now 
that it can be read fully and relatively quickly,&quot; said the Oxford academic 
directing the research, Dr Dirk Obbink. &quot;The material will shed light on 
virtually every aspect of life in Hellenistic and Roman Egypt, and, by 
extension, in the classical world as a whole.&quot;</p>
<p>The breakthrough has also caught the imagination of cultural commentators. 
Melvyn Bragg, author and presenter, said: &quot;It&#39;s the most fantastic news. There 
are two things here. The first is how enormously influential the Greeks were in 
science and the arts. The second is how little of their writing we have. The 
prospect of having more to look at is wonderful.&quot;</p>
<p>Bettany Hughes, historian and broadcaster, who has presented TV series 
including Mysteries of the Ancients and The Spartans, said: &quot;Egyptian rubbish 
dumps were gold mines. The classical corpus is like a jigsaw puzzle picked up at 
a jumble sale - many more pieces missing than are there. Scholars have always 
mourned the loss of works of genius - plays by Sophocles, Sappho&#39;s other poems, 
epics. These discoveries promise to change the textual map of the golden ages of 
Greece and Rome.&quot;</p>
<p>When it has all been read - mainly in Greek, but sometimes in Latin, Hebrew, 
Coptic, Syriac, Aramaic, Arabic, Nubian and early Persian - the new material 
will probably add up to around five million words. Texts deciphered over the 
past few days will be published next month by the London-based Egypt Exploration 
Society, which financed the discovery and owns the collection.</p>
<p><b>A 21st-century technique reveals antiquity&#39;s secrets</b></p>
<p>Since it was unearthed more than a century ago, the hoard of documents known 
as the Oxyrhynchus Papyri has fascinated classical scholars. There are 400,000 
fragments, many containing text from the great writers of antiquity. But only a 
small proportion have been read so far. Many were illegible.</p>
<p>Now scientists are using multi-spectral imaging techniques developed from 
satellite technology to read the papyri at Oxford University&#39;s Sackler Library. 
The fragments, preserved between sheets of glass, respond to the infra-red 
spectrum - ink invisible to the naked eye can be seen and photographed.</p>
<p>The fragments form part of a giant &quot;jigsaw puzzle&quot; to be reassembled. Missing 
&quot;pieces&quot; can be supplied from quotations by later authors, and grammatical 
analysis.</p>
<p><b>Key words from the master of Greek tragedy</b></p>
<p><b>Speaker A:</b> . . . gobbling the whole, sharpening the flashing iron.</p>
<p><b>Speaker B:</b> And the helmets are shaking their purple-dyed crests, and 
for the wearers of breast-plates the weavers are striking up the wise shuttle&#39;s 
songs, that wakes up those who are asleep.</p>
<p><b>Speaker A:</b> And he is gluing together the chariot&#39;s rail.</p>
<p>These words were written by the Greek dramatist Sophocles, and are the only 
known fragment we have of his lost play Epigonoi (literally &quot;The Progeny&quot;), the 
story of the siege of Thebes. Until last week&#39;s hi-tech analysis of ancient 
scripts at Oxford University, no one knew of their existence, and this is the 
first time they have been published.</p>
<p>Sophocles (495-405 BC), was a giant of the golden age of Greek civilisation, 
a dramatist who work alongside and competed with Aeschylus, Euripides and 
Aristophanes.</p>
<p>His best-known work is Oedipus Rex, the play that later gave its name to the 
Freudian theory, in which the hero kills his father and marries his mother - in 
a doomed attempt to escape the curse he brings upon himself. His other 
masterpieces include Antigone and Electra.</p>
<p>Sophocles was the cultured son of a wealthy Greek merchant, living at the 
height of the Greek empire. An accomplished actor, he performed in many of his 
own plays. He also served as a priest and sat on the committee that administered 
Athens. A great dramatic innovator, he wrote more than 120 plays, but only seven 
survive in full.</p>
<p>Last week&#39;s remarkable finds also include work by Euripides, Hesiod and 
Lucian, plus a large and particularly significant paragraph of text from the 
Elegies, by Archilochos, a Greek poet of the 7th century BC. </p>
