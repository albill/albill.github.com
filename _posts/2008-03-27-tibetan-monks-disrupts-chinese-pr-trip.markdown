The Chinese cover-up of what has occurred in Tibet continues but it is
not always going smoothly in front of foreign press. Chinese authorities
attempted to take media around Tibet's Lhasa to show that order was
restored and all was well. In the course of doing so, the group went to
Jokhang Temple and a group of Buddhist monks disrupted the media
briefing. The monks accused the Chinese government of lying about them
and the events. See [the Reuters
report](http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSPEK24297420080327?sp=true)
for more information. Here is one more quote from it:

> "About 30 young monks burst into the official briefing, shouting:
> 'Don't believe them. They are tricking you. They are telling lies',"
> USA Today Beijing-based reporter Callum MacLeod said by telephone from
> Lhasa. [...] "They just don't believe us. They think we will come out
> and cause havoc -- smash, destroy, rob, burn. We didn't do anything
> like that -- they're falsely accusing us," said one monk. "We want
> freedom. They have detained lamas and normal people."

You can see the video of the report embedded below or go to it

The [China Rises blog](http://washingtonbureau.typepad.com/china/)
covers this as well in a [recent
post](http://washingtonbureau.typepad.com/china/2008/03/hey-who-are-tho.html).
China Rises is written by Tim Johnson, the Beijing bureau chief for
McClatchy Newspapers. **Update:** A reader pointed out the [interview
with Zhou
Wenzhong](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89140776),
China's ambassador to the United States, on NPR this morning. He, of
course, blames the Dalai Lama for everything that has happened in Tibet.
He also ignores the peaceful protests that occurred before violence
broke out, focusing on criminality and violence. I find it interesting
that he repeatedly ignores the questions asked of him during the
interview on Tibetan concerns in favor of repeating what seems to be a
official propaganda.
