It comes up every so often that the only active sitting groups for the
[Five Mountain Sangha](http://www.fivemountain.org) are in the Los
Angeles area and in Cincinnati. Here in the Bay Area, there are only two
active members of the order. The other member, Greg LeBlanc, is a
teacher in the order but really only has the time to do a group sit once
a month because of his many (many!) other commitments. I generally
practice at home and don't do much in the way of group or together
action with others. I've gone to [Empty Gate Zen
Center](http://emptygatezen.com) run by the Kwan Um School, which is
part of the same overall lineage, but not on a regular basis. The lack
of a local sangha is, I feel, the biggest detriment of the model of
practice that we follow, where all of us are distributed across the
United States and get together for retreats. That said, I'm not sure
that the world, or at least the Bay Area, really needs more sitting
groups. In Cincinnati, it is different in that there are a total of two
(yes, two!) Zen groups. That's it. In that instance, forming a group, as
my teacher Jiun Foster has done, probably fills a real need. Here? Well,
off the top of my head, there are two large and long lived (since the
1970's) zen organizations with a building or two within two miles of my
house. If I'm willing to do out to five or six miles, there are
probably, easily, a dozen. In that circumstance, what does adding a
sitting group do? It strikes me as a bit hubristic to say, "Oh hey, I'm
going to form a Korean Zen group. We'll all get together and chant and
sit" when there is a group that has 30+ people meeting a bit over a mile
away. It feels self-focused in the way that we try to avoid. That isn't
to say it would be bad to have such a group but a large part of me says,
"Get over yourself. Just go to where the other Buddhists are!" Of
course, I hear that voice but I generally don't do so! I think it would
be much more useful to form a service-based group or organization and
fulfill some actual need (and that need is not to sit on a cushion). A
"Helping Hand" organization in some fashion. The back of my rakusu has a
poem on it in English. It says:

> great love,\
>  great compassion,\
>  the great Bodhisattva way,\
>  attaining Bodhidharma's family tradition.

This comes down to the maxim, the great question of a Bodhisattva, "How
can I help you?" Sitting and the support of a group can help a great
many people but there are many other ways to help others as well. I'm
not sure what **I** am ultimately going to do in that regard but it
seems likely that the help offered by running a small group of
practitioners is well covered. I think that I would better serve others
by finding ways to help other people that are not being covered to
relieve at least a little of their suffering. In the short-term, this
probably means getting off of my butt and cushion, and actually getting
over to San Quentin to work with the inmates there in their Zen group.
It may also mean some time in the local food banks or even, as funny as
it is, helping people in the community with their computers and
technical problems. There are many ways to serve others and we don't
need to fit everything into the Buddhist box. I'd be interested in any
thoughts others might offer on this kind of problem, not necessarily for
my situation but in the general sense of things Buddhists can do instead
of simply lighting incense, chanting, sitting, or ringing bells.
