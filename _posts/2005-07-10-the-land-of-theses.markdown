<p>I&#39;m still trying to come up with potential thesis topics. </p>
<p>My overall goal, other than getting the degree, is to have a thesis that I am 
interested in, would be proud to show to my peers and which may help me if I 
ever want to be published (even if it isn&#39;t the thesis) or do a PhD in my areas 
of interest.</p>
<p>My overall interests are in Western Esotericism, Neopaganism and Mysticism in 
practical and theoretical ways. To avoid accusations of bias, I won&#39;t do a 
thesis on things that I am directly involved in but I really do mean &quot;directly&quot; 
here as I couldn&#39;t really do any of the topics above if I scoped that too 
widely. </p>
<p>Given my nearly 16 year involvement in various aspects of Neopaganism and 
Esotericism, I&#39;d like to use my existing knowledge as an aide and not start over 
on a topic that I know nothing about.</p>
<p>The specific areas that I&#39;ve been thinking about recently are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Esoteric aspects of lodge ritual for defunct 19th or 20th century fringe 
	masonic orders. (There are a lot of defunct organizations with no surviving 
	bodies.)</li>
	<li>Examination of esoteric content in significant fraternal works (Albert 
	Pike was a contender here but it sounds like much of the work has been done, 
	even if only within Masonic researchcircles).</li>
	<li>Examination of the ritual work, training or philosophy of an explicitly 
	esoteric order. (For example, if BOTA or the OTO didn&#39;t exist but their 
	papers were in archives...)</li>
</ul>
<p>I then devolve into looking at more of the modern Neopagan elements. Right 
now, I&#39;m inclined to stay within the realm of things influenced by Masonry. 
Unless I&#39;m examining a specific historical figure and his thought, I&#39;d like to 
avoid Freemasonry proper since I&#39;m a Fellowcraft mason and there are issues of 
both bias and my own oaths.</p>
<p>Many other ideas have come to me but most wind up being practices and groups 
with surviving members. As much as some people are assholes, I&#39;d like to avoid 
academic detailed discussion of the practices of current groups. It isn&#39;t really 
ethical in my opinion. That leaves out Dadaji, for example.</p>
<p>Previously, I had decided to stay away from the Golden Dawn, feeling that 
this was pretty heavily examined already but now I am not so sure it is. I know 
that there are quite a few Golden Dawn areas of interest that seem largely 
unexamined. One (vague) idea was to look at the history of ideas around the 
assumption of godforms: where did the Golden Dawn get it, how did successor 
orders take it up, its influence into Wicca, etc. I&#39;m not sure that there is 
enough primary source materials to really stay focused on core information and 
not devolve into discussing popular beliefs.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also explicitly focusing on the United States or the U.K. since English 
is my first language and the only one that I&#39;m still fluent in (ask me about my 
lapsed Russian sometime). On a plus note, Bob Gilbert states that he could 
probably get me personal access to one or some of the collections of privately 
held Golden Dawn papers if I was willing to come to the U.K. That would be quite 
a trip though.</p>
