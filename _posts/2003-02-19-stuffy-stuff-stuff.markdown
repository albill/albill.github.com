Well, today felt like Monday to me until I hit Latin. I took yesterday
off from work with almost no notice. I decided that after Hell Week this
last week and some issues this weekend that having a nice Monday at home
with R would be nice. We slept in, had a nice breakfast and then went
and saw a movie. The debate was "**Daredevil** or **Chicago**??" but
intelligence seemed to overcome the geek factor and we went to Chicago.
I must say that I had somehow missed out on the fact that this movie was
a musical in large ways. I just thought it was set in the Jazz Cabarets
of Chicago. That being said, I did enjoy the movie and it's probably one
of the better ones that I've seen in a while. (I was warned away from
the new Kevin Spacey film and towards **The Quiet American** by a movie
reviewer friend as well.) Today I went back to work and it seems like I
didn't miss much yesterday. We still have my reorg coming up and it
**still** hasn't actually been announced officially to any team. We keep
waiting and waiting for the official announcements. I've been through
enough of these that it doesn't bug me too much but I think my guys are
wigging out a little about it as they are all much more recent hires
than me. Latin class was fun though I swear I had to fight not to nod
off during the overly long discussion of scanning Latin poetry and Ovid.
I'm not really a poetry kind of guy and I don't get off on reading in
metre except during invocatory verse so a 25 minute session on how to
read five lines of Ovid was a bit much. I'm much more interested in
Renaissance Latin and its texts than a lot of the actual Roman material
though I do look forward to being able to read Cicero some day. (I still
think the Carthaginians should have kicked Roman ass too...) I've been
reading reports of Pantheacon today and feeling bad that I didn't go
this year. As you may recall, o longtime readers, I went last year and
posted my field reports from my laptop. Ah well, perhaps next year. We
have five and a half weeks until we fly to Greece anyway.
