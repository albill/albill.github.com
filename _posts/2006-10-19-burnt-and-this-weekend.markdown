R is going out of town this weekend to go to a Babalon Puja down in
Santa Monica. I'm going to be going to the Troma Nagmo empowerment
tomorrow night with my friend, Nathan. This is at [Orgyen Dorje
Den](http://www.orgyendorjeden.org/), a local Nyingma center that is in
Alameda, about 15 minutes away from me, as it turns out. She is one of
the wrathful dakinis and a primary figure in the Dudjom Tersar tradition
of practice. The Vajrakilaya empowerment and teachings I received this
last year are from the same lineage. Most people who know her are
familiar with her from Chod practice, where she is often the primary
deity. She's a Vajrayana form of Kali, among other things. I'll probably
be attending these teachings during Saturday day as well though it
depends on what exactly will be covered. On Saturday evening, I'm
considering going to [**Burnt**](http://www.artfagmafia.com/events.html)
at [Nimby](http://www.nimbyspace.org/), an artist space in Oakland. This
looks to be a mixed event of music, fire performances, aerial work and
something said to be ritual (though I shudder at what that may be
here...). If anyone local plans to go or is interested, let me know.
