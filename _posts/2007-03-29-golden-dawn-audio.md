The Grey Lodge Occult Review is out with a <a href="http://www.greylodge.org/occultreview/">new issue</a>. Overall, there thing isn't quite my ball of wax but there is one thing that they have made available that is... They've put up a bunch of the audio that Israel Regardie recorded of him doing Golden Dawn rituals or lecturing on them.

As my readers may recall, the Golden Dawn is the topic of my dissertation though Regardie did these in the 1980s so it is long after the period that I am concerned with in my work. Regardie was initiated in 1934 in the Stella Matutina. The SM was the Golden Dawn order that was created after the great split in 1903 and which was run by Dr. Felkin. He took it with him to New Zealand. It's last surviving body was Whare Ra, which closed in the 1970s. Regardie's claim to fame was being the first person outside of Crowley to completely violate his oaths to the order by publishing the four volumes of Golden Dawn material which Llewellyn still sells as <strong>The Golden Dawn</strong>. He was also, previously, the poor unfortunate young man who acted as Aleister Crowley's personal secretary, whatever that actually means.

Later in life, he was much lauded over, probably rightfully so, as a Golden Dawn elder figure. What most people don't seem to realize is that the Middle Pillar ritual, while described very loosely in the Golden Dawn material, was actually the creation of Regardie. Given the hundreds or thousands of occultists who have been time visualizing the Tree of Life on their body and circulating energy while vibrating Hebrew names, that seems to be a pretty lasting addition to the corpus as actually practiced.

In any case, this is a list of the material that they have up on the site:
