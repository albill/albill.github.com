[Todd
Bishop](http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/bio.asp#bio18359)
at the [Seattle Post-Intelligencer](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/) has
a Monday column there called, "[Software
Notebook](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/338069_software05.html),"
in the Business section of the paper. He is also one of the people in
the local Seattle press that has a
[blog](http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/) on Microsoft
issues and regularly covers Microsoft. In this week's
[column](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/338069_software05.html),
he focuses Internet Explorer and the lack of information about IE8, the
general lack of communication concerning IE, its schedule, and plans,
and the frustrations outside of Microsoft about this:

> After taking five years to come out with the current Internet Explorer
> 7, Microsoft offered a mea culpa and said it was aiming for a new
> release every 12 to 18 months. But so far there has been little
> information about Internet Explorer 8, and no public schedule for
> releasing preliminary and final versions. It now appears that a gap of
> two years or more between IE releases might be more realistic, say
> analysts and others in a position to assess the situation. That kind
> of time frame wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing for Internet
> Explorer users, one analyst says. But a couple of former members of
> the Internet Explorer team say they wish the company was being more
> clear about what the next Internet Explorer will entail.

After exchanging a bit of e-mail, Todd and I spoke on the phone last
week. I am quoted for the piece, along with IE alumnus, [Dave
Massy](http://www.dmassy.com). It will be interesting to see if
Microsoft has a response to this and, perhaps, if it prompts the IE team
to be a slight bit more public (like saying anything at all really).
**Update**: There is [more on this
topic](http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/125076.asp)
on Todd Bishop's [blog](http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/)
today as well.
