I need to get a car radio that plays mp3s. The common way that I listen to  podcasts is to download them in iTunes (because it is easier that way), burn  them to an audio CD (if they are less than 80 minutes) and then listen to them  in my car. This is kind of a pain in the ass. Leaving aside how long it takes me  to prep, it makes me use a few writable CD's a week and causes waste. One of my  coworkers bought a cheap stereo that simply plays mp3 files from a flash drive.  I'm considering doing the same since I have a 2 gig flash drive.

This is the way I listen to James Foster's <strong>Path of the Mahayana</strong>  podcast every week. (Jim is the Tendai teacher that I am working with as a  Tendai practitioner now but he isn't as stuffy as that would normally sound...).  I recommend his podcast to anyone interested in the application of Buddhist  practice in life, especially drawing from the Japanese tradition. His podcast  consists of his short teaching talks following meditation and liturgical  practice every week. They are relatively short and Jim is funnier than he gives  himself credit as being.

Another podcast that I listen to is Ken McLeod's <strong>Unfettered Mind</strong>  series. Ken McLeod was a longterm study of Kalu Rinpoche in the Tibetan  tradition. He's been practicing for over 30 years and teaching for around half  of that (I believe). He runs a <a href="http://www.unfetteredmind.org/index.php"> website</a> with translations and is the author of <strong> <a href="http://www.unfetteredmind.org/book/about.php">Wake Up to Your Life</a></strong>,  an excellent practical book on Buddhist practice that works to avoid jargon and  be immediately relevant to people. Ken has been making a <a href="http://www.unfetteredmind.org/resources/audio.php">podcast</a>  available for a while, which is largely audio drawn from retreats that he runs.  I was listening to "<a target="resource" href="http://www.unfetteredmind.com/resources/audio/podcast/GDP%2001a.mp3">GDP  01a: Guru, Deity, Protector (retreat)</a>" this morning and found it to be both  engaging and immediately relevant.

In the past, I've heard some teachers give a relatively inflexible take on  Buddhist tradition and the approaches to it. Both Jim and Ken seem to be  comfortable in their respective traditions and able to relate the material to  Western students in a way that makes more sense. I find this more approachable  than the instances where I've been to events or retreats where the lama (who is  often very wonderful) has trouble translating concepts in ways which are easily  understood by those of us in the West. The fact that there is often a translator  involved and the lama lives outside the West day to day does not help either. It  is good to see more Western teachers out there freely communicating with people.
