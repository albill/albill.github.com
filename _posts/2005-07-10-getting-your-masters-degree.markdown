This was written by a friend of mine. Given my post of last night, this one seems appropriate:<blockquote><h3><a title="Site: Breezewood Roundtable" href="http://bwrt.blogspot.com/2005/03/grad-school-in-six-easy-steps.html" target="_blank">Grad School in Six Easy Steps</a></h3><strong>by William Shaver Zaza, MA (pending)((hopefully))</strong>

1. Buy a lot of books--about 300 or so--preferably dense, unreadable ones with a colon in their titles.
2. Don't read them.
3. Get a bunch of friends together and criticize the books without admitting to each other that you haven't read them.
4. Write a twenty-page paper on 10 of the books, again without reading them.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 six times.
6. Receive Master's Degree.</blockquote>He left out writing the thesis though.
