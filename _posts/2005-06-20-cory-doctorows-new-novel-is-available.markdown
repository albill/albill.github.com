I had this pre-orderd and it seems to have come out early...

Cory Doctorow's new novel, <b>Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town</b> is available online now at:

<a href="http://craphound.com/someone/download.php">http://craphound.com/someone/download.php</a>

The general site for his book is at <a href="http://www.craphound.com/someone/">http://www.craphound.com/someone/</a>.

As some of you may know, Cory is an excellent science fiction author who also happens to be a computer geek working for the EFF. For those of us who are both geeks and science fiction fans, his books are a bit of home. (Charlie Stross and Ken MacLeod are the same in many ways as well...) His books seem to be pretty well received by non-geeks as well.
