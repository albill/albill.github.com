<p>I received my copy of my final <b>World Religions</b> paper yesterday. I must 
say that it, literally, looked like it had been inside that UPS package from the 
opening of <b>Ace Ventura</b> (for those that remember that one). All folded up 
on itself, wrinkled with about 10% of the bibliography page ripped away. I think 
there was some rubber cement stuck to it too (I hope).</p>
<p>I received an &#39;A&#39; and actually had the amusement value, while reading my 
prof&#39;s spider-like handwriting, of him make a comments in reference to Christian 
Fundamentalists bombing abortion clinics and killing doctors that I, personally, 
make about two pages after he mentioned it. I&#39;ve noticed that he doesn&#39;t read 
the paper once or twice before writing his comments but does them as he goes, 
sometimes correcting himself when you make the point he thought was missing.</p>
<p>This means my final grade for the class is an &#39;A&#39;. I received the grade for 
my third literature paper a week ago. This was also an &#39;A&#39; though he commented 
on how my paper didn&#39;t actually focus on the topic of <b>Self</b>, which is part 
of the supposed theme that I was supposed to find a thesis on. He liked the 
paper in every way, otherwise, and found it original enough to give me a good 
grade. Compare this my first paper, where I got an &#39;AB&#39; (3.66) because while I 
focused entirely on the topic that he wanted and it was well written, my thesis 
choice wasn&#39;t terribly original. What lesson do I learn from this? Style, 
originality, and the craft of riding will win out over actually doing the 
assignment as assigned. I wonder if this applies to other classes?</p>
<p>Tonight, I turned in my final literature paper (on the prison of Solness&#39; 
guilt in Henrik Ibsen&#39;s <b>The Master Builder</b>). This finishes my literature 
(thank you, gods of earth and starry heaven). I&#39;d actually managed to avoid 
Ibsen entirely during my undergraduate days so I didn&#39;t mind getting a chance to 
read him.</p>
<p>I have a week until my &quot;Fall&quot; semester starts. I&#39;m more concerned about this 
one because the subject matter and paper requirements seem a bit more difficult. 
On the plus side, I get to read Thomas Paine, John Stuart Mill, Dostoevsky, 
Virginia Wolfe, and B.F. Skinner, among others. At least the reading won&#39;t be 
boring.</p>
<p>After this Fall&#39;s term, I only have &quot;Spring&quot; (which starts in winter, go 
figure) and one class next Summer. After that, it is my as-yet-undetermined 
thesis.</p>
<p>This is my lineup for Fall, Spring and next Summer.</p>
