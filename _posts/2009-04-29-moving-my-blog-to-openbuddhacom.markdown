I’ve had my blog at arcanology.com for a few years now. I chose the
domain name, which means “the study of mysteries”, when I was working on
my Master’s degree. My work there, and my thesis, focused on Western
Esotericism, specifically the view of the soul in the Hermetic Order of
the Golden Dawn.

These days, as people no doubt notice, I tend to blog about Buddhism, my
future academic work (…in Buddhism), or geek stuff such as tech or
science fiction.

I’ve owned openbuddha.\* (com, net, org) for a while and haven’t been
using it since my failed attempts to start a web community on the site.
I also own onesangha.org, which is the failed attempt to start a group
blog (I can’t even get my own teacher to write posts for it) with four
or more other people. Out of these various other domains, only the
recent [Zen Community](http://community.zen-sangha.org) site is really
doing well and it really does so simply by the fact that 25 bloggers are
cycling posts through it.

Given my larger focus on Buddhism and the fact that it will continue
while I do my doctoral work, I am going to move my blog over to
OpenBuddha.com. I’ll have to figure out how to do the redirection of my
feeds so those subscribed to the arcanology.com feeds don’t have their
feeds broken. Assuming that I can do this, it should be pretty
transparent as a move. I expect to get the new site up in the next week,
assuming that I have time.
