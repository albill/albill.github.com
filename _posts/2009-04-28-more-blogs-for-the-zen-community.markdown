As some people may remember, I started up an aggregation blog (also
called a “planet” within the open source world) of various Zen and
Zen-related blogs a short while ago. This is called “The Zen Community”
and is up at
[http://community.zen-sangha.org](http://community.zen-sangha.org/).

Currently, 25 blogs are syndicated on the site (including the Buddhism
posts from this blog). I’d like to have more of a cross section of the
Zen community. Most of the current set came when I promoted the blog on
[Zen Forum International](http://www.zenforuminternational.org/), a new
online Zen forum, or when I wrote to the blog authors directly. I’m sure
that there are a lot more out there that would be an excellent addition
to the site.

I’d like people to leave comments with suggested sites to add or to
e-mail me as ‘albill@gmail.com” (if you’d prefer).
