<p>As some people may remember, I started up an aggregation blog (also called a &#8220;planet&#8221; within the open source world) of various Zen and Zen-related blogs a short while ago. This is called &#8220;The Zen Community&#8221; and is up at <a href="http://community.zen-sangha.org/">http://community.zen-sangha.org</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, 25 blogs are syndicated on the site (including the Buddhism posts from this blog). I&#8217;d like to have more of a cross section of the Zen community. Most of the current set came when I promoted the blog on <a href="http://www.zenforuminternational.org/">Zen Forum International</a>, a new online Zen forum, or when I wrote to the blog authors directly. I&#8217;m sure that there are a lot more out there that would be an excellent addition to the site. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d like people to leave comments with suggested sites to add or to e-mail me as &#8216;albill@gmail.com&#8221; (if you&#8217;d prefer). </p>
