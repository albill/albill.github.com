Which is more frightening, the confirmed zealot or the desperate but desiring unbeliever? How often do you find yourself doubting your spirituality? Do you question your beliefs? Do you think that you do so more or less than others of your faith? Do you find the unconcerned certainty of the believer comforting or disturbing? Is skepticism necessary or damaging? I've seen opposed answers to the last depending on the spiritual tradition and, even within a tradition, the teacher. I am firmly convinced that skepticism and a lack of certainty go hand in hand with spiritual discovery. I find few things to be more scary than an unquestioning, firm and zealous belief in the correctness of any other belief. Thus are people tortured, rape, and slaughter for daring to believe otherwise. What do you think? How do you feel about these things?
