I&apos;m in Minneapolis using my friend, Elliott&apos;s, computer. I&apos;m staying with him and his wife this evening. A long day... up at 6:30 AM, anal probe at the airport, flight to Minneapolis and general galavanting around town. We had a nice dinner at an Asian fusion restaurant and I got what I think was a five-shot Americano (no, I&apos;m not joking...it was a quad by default from the sign and the barrista gave me an extra shot...) after dinner because I was dragging. Of course, the time here is two hours later so it&apos;s really before 11:00 PM for me. Tomorrow is a day of relaxation and hanging out before more serious work in the afternoon. I&apos;ll be back in Seattle on Sunday afternoon.
