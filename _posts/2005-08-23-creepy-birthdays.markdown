<p>I had a 206 area code phone call at work this afternoon. When I picked up, a older, gravelly male voice sang a belated happy birthday song in rhyme. Then it paused a few seconds, in which I said "Hello?" and then it hung up...</p>

<p>I'm pretty good with voices and I didn't recognize this one nor the number it called from. I didn't write the number down before it ended though.</p>
