A transcription from South by Southwest thinger that's been going on this last week... Sterling is one of my current heroes. ;-) <a href="http://www.cardhouse.com/heath/2003_03_09_archive.html#90599497">http://www.cardhouse.com/heath/2003_03_09_archive.html#90599497</a> <strong>Introductions</strong> <strong>Sterling:</strong> I'm an author. My most recent book is actually a futurist book. After I did this book, I got this really sweet gig writing for Wired, writing this monthly futurist column. That explains what the heck I'm doing here. Derek and I are going to start ripping on six major league change drivers. Were just going to ping pong some things back and forth. <strong>Woodgate:</strong> I'm principal of the futures lab here in Austin. We work with major corporations looking for what we call future potential for them. We really look to provide them with what a strategic plan or R&D company can't. I'm a political economist by profession. (Read the rest at the link...)
