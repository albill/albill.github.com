A transcription from South by Southwest thinger that's been going on
this last week... Sterling is one of my current heroes. ;-)

**Introductions** **Sterling:** I'm an author. My most recent book is
actually a futurist book. After I did this book, I got this really sweet
gig writing for Wired, writing this monthly futurist column. That
explains what the heck I'm doing here. Derek and I are going to start
ripping on six major league change drivers. Were just going to ping pong
some things back and forth. **Woodgate:** I'm principal of the futures
lab here in Austin. We work with major corporations looking for what we
call future potential for them. We really look to provide them with what
a strategic plan or R&D company can't. I'm a political economist by
profession. (Read the rest at the link...)
