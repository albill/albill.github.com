I had no idea that there was a [Swedenborgian Church in San
Francisco](http://www.sfswedenborgian.org/) (and in a famous building,
at that). How interesting!

*Church Interior* I've always been fascinated by
[Swedenborg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedenborg), who went from
being a scientist to becoming a visionary. Swedenborg's impact on the
Western Esoteric tradition was quite high and elements of his thought
can still be found today in various groups and traditions. I had heard,
when I lived in Seattle, that there was some kind of
[Swedenborgian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedenborgianism) church in
another city nearby but few details. It isn't my cup of tea but I'm glad
they are out there.
