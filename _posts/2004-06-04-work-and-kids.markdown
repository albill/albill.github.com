How the hell do you explain to an eight year old what a "Software Test Engineer" does? I'm stumped. It's like this episode of that 70's Show that I saw once where Kelso goes to work with his dad and spends the entire episode with his dad trying to explain the pencil-pushing job he does and not getting it.
