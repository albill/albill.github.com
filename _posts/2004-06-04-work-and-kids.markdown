How the hell do you explain to an eight year old what a "Software Test
Engineer" does? I'm stumped. It's like this episode of that 70's Show
that I saw once where Kelso goes to work with his dad and spends the
entire episode with his dad trying to explain the pencil-pushing job he
does and not getting it.
