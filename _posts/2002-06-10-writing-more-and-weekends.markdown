Well, I obviously haven't been writing as much recently. I wind up not writing a lot on the weekends as I tend to keep busy with R and/or my daughter on most weekends recently. The weekends are the only time that R and I can see each other during the day without my taking a break from work or her doing the same. Otherwise, we see each other at 1:00 am after she gets home from work and it is hard to do much at that time.

During the week, recently, I've been spending a certain amount of extra time at work and not getting out as much. We're in a bit of a push to finally ship a beta of our product and the final version will be effectively done by the end of August or so. I probably ate dinner at work (it shows up at 7:00) four out of the last five workdays and the same the week before.

Friday was the day we write our Annual Reviews. This is an exercise that they will give you daily in Hell if you are sent there. I probably took about five hours or so to write mine. The most that I've ever taken but less than many people. I listed, in some level of detail, what I've done with all of my tasks at work during the last year. What a load of shit to type up. ;-)

Friday night, I met up with  Dan for beer and to give him a copy of WinXP. He was trying to install an ancient version of Win98 on his brand new computer and I took pity on him. We hung out for a while and BS'd about things. Later, I met up with J, 's boyfriend and founder of the Cabiri, at Bauhaus and hung out over coffee and chatted. He and I haven't done that a lot in the last few months. He's definitely done some weird ass stuff in his life.

Saturday was Aquarium day and I took Madeline and R down there after R and I went out for breakfast. I haven't been to the Aquarium in years and they have some fun stuff there. The giant octopus is my favorite though. R and I went to see Spiderman later on and had a nice time at that.

Sunday was a nice slow day in the morning and evening. R cooked delicious food today (both breakfast and dinner), which was rather nice. In the mid-afternoon, we met with W, one of the main organizers of the Black Sun Gathering, for a ritual practice for the main rite there. I'm really looking forward to the gathering though the ritual itself and my role fills me with a certain amount of trepidation. It was a really nice day and R and I used that to our advantage to wander around the cemetary, Volunteer Park and parts of Capitol Hill. I got a fair amount of sun today.

In any case, I have an 8:00 am Monday meeting (<strong>those bastards!</strong>) in the morning so I should probably go to bed now.
