<img border="2" src="http://www.zhangzhung.net/pics/Olivia-Al-bday.jpg" width="233" height="350" alt="Olivia and Al" align="left" hspace="6">Today 
was my day to visit the inmates at McNeil Island and to lead them on their 
voyage of self-discovery in the joys of Wicca and the arms of the Goddess. 
Actually, since certain troublemakers got the boot to other facilities, the 
dynamic of the group has continued to be friendly and easy going. I like the 
guys, for the most part. For a bunch of criminals, they are a generally sane 
bunch and are very intent on improving their lives. In many ways, they are truer 
believes that many of the pagans that I know as the inmates are much better 
focused a lot of the time.</p>
<p>We&#39;re also preparing for their annual feast (think Christmas equivilant), 
which is done for Samhain. We&#39;re doing it on October 30 this year. I&#39;ll be going 
out for my normal visit a week before and then I&#39;ll follow it up on the 30th 
with Samhain ritual work with them in the morning. I&#39;ll hang out until the late 
afternoon, when family and guests will arrive for the dinner feast. Monk might 
even be in town from Kuwait and I know the guys would love to see him at the 
feast if not the week before.</p>
<p>After I got back in the early afternoon, R and I went over to Rubylou&#39;s place 
for Olivia&#39;s first birthday party. See picture to right of me being distracted 
from taunting the little bug. She&#39;s a sweet kid and obviously was having a good 
time. She really likes her new musical toys as well!!</p>
<p>When R and I finally got home, I took a nap for a while (I&#39;d been up about 12 
hours at that point). She went out after a while to meet friends for her 
batchelorette party. I&#39;d decided not to do a bachelor party for myself (too many 
things during the day and a lack of desire, really) but R convinced me to drop 
by the Vogue around 10:00 or so and meet up with her and her friends. This I did 
after watching Snake Blisken on TV for a while and many drinks were had by all. 
We got to hang out with our friends who, amazingly, all turned into pumpkins 
before us. We were the last to leave with many begging off with the 
&quot;explanation&quot; that they were the mass team for the Gnostic Mass tomorrow and 
couldn&#39;t be out late. Bah!</p>
<p>Tomorrow is house-cleaning day since we have a bajillion freakin&#39; people in 
our house at the end of the week. We&#39;re doing the rehearsal dinner at the house 
Friday night and the wedding is Saturday. My mom and Bill arrive on Thursday 
night and will be staying with us as well. My brother and his new wife will be 
staying with my grandparents (y&#39;all knew I had a brother, right?). Along with 
this, I&#39;ll be picking <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/webster/">Sam</a> up at 
the airport on Friday and taking care of him since he&#39;s doing our wedding and 
all. Everyone leaves Sunday except for Mom and Bill, who leave Monday afternoon. 
Monday morning, R and I will get up, drop the ferret off at the Vet for storage 
(they do a kennel thing) and then taking the shuttle to the airport to fly to 
Milan!</p>
<p>Busy times, indeed. I know that I should be excited about the wedding and I 
am but I just have visions of hordes of fucking people in my house. &lt;sigh&gt;</p>
