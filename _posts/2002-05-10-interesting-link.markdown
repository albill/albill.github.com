Found on a new friend's journal today:
[http://www.likeanillusion.com/dakinis.shtml](http://www.likeanillusion.com/dakinis.shtml).
The last few days haven't given me a lot to comment on to other people.
I got a new computer at work, a nice one, and spent hours extra over the
last two days trying to get it to work. I haven't gotten home before
9:30 either night. It turns out that the computer has some sort of
hardware problem that causes it to reboot at will and act otherwise
flaky. It's a bit frustrating and it ate up a bunch of my personal time.
I went in late today (and will tomorrow) to try to take some of my life
back... ;-)
