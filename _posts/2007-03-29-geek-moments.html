We had this conversation in the kitchen area at work yesterday about Star Wars. Now, by some accounts, that might be bad enough but this is a tech company after all...

What we wound up discussing was spin-off novels because I've been talking online to Sean Williams recently, who has co-written a trilogy of them and has more coming out in the next year.

So, you had a bunch of geeks standing in the kitchen of a Bay Area startup debating continuity in comparing Star Wars novels read as a child (like <strong>Splinter of the Mind's Eye</strong> or the Han Solo series of books) with the current "Expanded Universe" continuity. The general consensus is that Lucas used to let people have a lot more fun.

Also, many of us are closet Star Wars fans who had our childhood memories burned, crushed, and then eviscerated by the combination of the re-edits of the original movies followed by the abysmal prequels that should have been just left to novels or not at all.
