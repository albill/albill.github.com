It seems that there has been a live action role-playing group that does
Cthulhu scenarios. Normally, even though I did LARP'ing back before it
had that name, I heap derision on LARP'ers, these guys are pretty
crafty. Take a look at these scenarios:

-   [The Master
    Race](http://www.cthulhulives.org/Game33MasterRace/frame33.html)
-   [The Helmet](http://www.cthulhulives.org/Game48/frame48.html)
-   [The Eye of R'as al
    Ghethi](http://www.cthulhulives.org/Game2/frame2.html) (I like the
    unfortunately realistic ending the first time they did this one...)

Those are some kick ass props they built, especially for the Helmet, and
a puppet!! The main site page is at
