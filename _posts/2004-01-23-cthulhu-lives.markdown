It seems that there has been a live action role-playing group that does Cthulhu scenarios. Normally, even though I did LARP'ing back before it had that name, I heap derision on LARP'ers, these guys are pretty crafty.

Take a look at these scenarios:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.cthulhulives.org/Game33MasterRace/frame33.html">The Master Race</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.cthulhulives.org/Game48/frame48.html">The Helmet
	<li><a href="http://www.cthulhulives.org/Game2/frame2.html">The Eye of R'as al Ghethi</a> (I like the unfortunately realistic ending the first time they did this one...)</li>
</a></li>
</ul>
Those are some kick ass props they built, especially for the Helmet, and a puppet!!
