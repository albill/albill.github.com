# Iraq Adopts Terror Alert System

BAGHDADâ€”The Iraqi Department of Homeland Security recently released a
10-level, color-coded homeland security advisory system that will alert
citizens to the risk of a terrorist attack within Iraq's borders. The
country's current threat level is elevated, or Code Yellow-Orange.
Citizens living in towns with populations of 1,500 or more should
prepare for the smoke of burning vehicles to obscure the sun and expect
hostages to be tortured for several days before being killed. Should the
terror risk level rise to Code Orange-Yellow, it is likely that hostages
will be left alive only long enough to dig their own graves.
