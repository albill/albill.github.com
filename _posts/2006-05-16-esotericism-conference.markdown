I will be attending the second conference run by the [Association for
the Study of Esotericism](http://www.aseweb.org/) from June 8 through 11
at the University of California, Davis. The mission statement for the
association is [online](http://www.aseweb.org/ASE/ASEMission.html) but
it is an academic organization focusing on Western Esotericism, which is
the area in which I will be writing my thesis for my MA. The schedule
for the conference is up as well at
[http://www.aseweb.org/ASE2006Schedule.htm](http://www.aseweb.org/ASE2006Schedule.htm).
I plan to attend the Friday sessions on "Issues in Pre-Modern
Esotericism" and probably "Sources and Renewals in Contemporary
Esotericism." The rest of Friday isn't clear. On Saturday, I plan to
attend "Theurgy and Christian Cabbalah," "Alchemy," "Esoteric Figures
and Movements: 19^th^ and Early 20^th^ Centuries" and "Importing the
East into Western Esotericism." On Sunday, I will definitely be
attending Claire's sesion on methodology as well, since this is an issue
close and dear to my heart. If anyone else that I know is attending the
conference, drop me a line. I know some of my online correspondents will
be there.
