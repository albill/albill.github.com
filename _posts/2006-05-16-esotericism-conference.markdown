I will be attending the second conference run by the <a href="http://www.aseweb.org/">Association for the Study of Esotericism</a> from June 8 through 11 at the University of California, Davis. The mission statement for the association is <a href="http://www.aseweb.org/ASE/ASEMission.html">online</a> but it is an academic organization focusing on Western Esotericism, which is the area in which I will be writing my thesis for my MA. The schedule for the conference is up as well at <a href="http://www.aseweb.org/ASE2006Schedule.htm">http://www.aseweb.org/ASE2006Schedule.htm</a>. I plan to attend the Friday sessions on "Issues in Pre-Modern Esotericism" and probably "Sources and Renewals in Contemporary Esotericism." The rest of Friday isn't clear. On Saturday, I plan to attend "Theurgy and Christian Cabbalah," "Alchemy," "Esoteric Figures and Movements: 19<sup>th</sup> and Early 20<sup>th</sup> Centuries" and "Importing the East into Western Esotericism." On Sunday, I will definitely be attending Claire's sesion on methodology as well, since this is an issue close and dear to my heart. If anyone else that I know is attending the conference, drop me a line. I know some of my online correspondents will be there.
