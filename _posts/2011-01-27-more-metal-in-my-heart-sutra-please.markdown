A friend of mine sent this to me today. It is a metal version of the
Heart Sutra and is so amazingly epic that I decided that I couldn't just
share it as a tweet on my [twitter
account](http://twitter.com/openbuddha). Many, if not most, Mahayana
Buddhists of various sects make a practice of chanting the [Heart
Sutra](http://www.openbuddha.com/resources/sutras/heart-sutra/) in
either their own language or that of from wherever their form of
Buddhism comes. I tend to chant it in English as a regular practice but
when I, for example, visit Rev. Keisho the Tendai priest, we chant it in
a shomyo form used within Tendai in Japanese. One is not really
encouraged to embellish it but it is such a common practice that I think
the temptation is there, just as much as you see people in the West
messing with old Church hymns that they grew up hearing. I know nothing
about the video beyond the Youtube data but that's ok. It was an
interesting diversion for a few minutes. I've embedded it below or you
can [watch it on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7aButXpZfY).
