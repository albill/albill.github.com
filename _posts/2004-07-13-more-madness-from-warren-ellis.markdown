***antistarz*** Society is not your friend. It doesn't care about you.
We're logs for the steam engine of society. Shove us in and burn us up
to keep the wheels turning. So throw the machine into reverse. See,
there is no massive world conspiracy to keep things crappy. There's a
business plan. There's a million business plans. And they're based into
coercing you into buying their products. And cheating the other people
who have products to sell you. There are no secret chiefs. There are no
space aliens or supernatural entities running things. Just governments.
And governments are essentially incompetent. In Britain, there are
government cameras on the roads. Big Brother, right? But most of them
don't have any film in. That's not a competent Scary Government. But an
incompetent with a gun can still kill you. That's why they're dangerous.
Running a war badly still gets people killed. So you know what we need
to do? We need to become the Secret Chiefs, and the space aliens, and
the supernatural entities. Antistars. (c) Warren Ellis 2004 all rights
