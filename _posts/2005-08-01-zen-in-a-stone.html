I found this online this evening. This feeds into my interest in various biofeedback devices. Would it be a Stone Mirror? :-)
<h2>Zen in a Stone</h2>

<a href="http://www.iging.com/" title="http://www.iging.com/"></a>

<a href="http://www.iging.com/" title="http://www.iging.com/">I Ching </a>(or the ‘Book of Changes’) is the most widely read of the five Chinese Classics. In this system, you think about the question you would like to ask the book, throw 3 coins, calculate ‘a structure’ and reinforce it in one of the book’s pages. The page the book offers will provide a kind of Zen text. The idea is to put one’s mind in motion, trying to understand what the real answer is in regards to a personal question. The mind will start processing the question and may find an answer.

What if we could exchange the coin throwing with technology: can technology change or enhance philosophy in terms of shape? Is it possible to build a ‘magical’ device that could be used following the ‘I Ching’ philosophy?
<strong>First prototype:</strong>

A person touches the device and asks a question. The biofeedback device (the GSR2, a Galvanic Skin Response monitoring biofeedback device) will check his/her bio-status and as s/he becomes more relaxed the device’s interface reveals an image while in the background the sound of wind chimes grows in volume. By following this process the individual is falling into a ‘meditation’ state of mind. After some time, an output of the relevant text from the Book of Changes is displayed.

The GSR2 was connected to a <a href="http://wiring.org.co/" title="http://wiring.org.co/">Wiring </a>board, reading the outcoming sound signal. A <a href="http://www.nastypixel.com/prototype/cms/myfiles/pages/iching/">Flash application</a> connected to the device provides related visuals and sounds on screen.

The prototype was working and people interacted with it with positive reactions. It was time to push the idea forward in terms of design: on both a product design and conceptual level.

It is a device to be used within a personal environment and from the outside looks like a simple rounded river stone. Inside the stone is a hidden biofeedback device with audio capabilities. A person should ask himself a question while holding the stone in his hand, While the person is becoming more relaxed and free of thoughts a Zen answer based on the original ‘Book of Changes’ is played in a soft human voice.
