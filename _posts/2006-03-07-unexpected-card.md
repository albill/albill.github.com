I had a surprise card in the mail today from the Palyul Monastic Association.

I opened it up and there is an unbleached cardstock card that shows a pair of  hands holding a mala (a rosary) on the outside. Opening it, it says "Special  prayers and ceremony have been performed by the spiritual community at Kunzang  Palyul Choling, Poolesville, MD for" and then it has "Al Billings and Father"  written in pen. This is followed by "We joyfully offer our support in this way  and sincerely wish that benefit will comes as a result of this effort."

This is very moving and unexpected. I wish to thank whichever of my friends  arranged this. The center's website is at <a href="http://www.kpc-md-tara.org/"> http://www.kpc-md-tara.org/</a>.
