So, I'm going to be in London at the British Museum during my 10+ hour
layover... If I wanted to buy a UK science fiction novel (half the stuff
I read is from the UK these days), it seems a good time to get one. But
where? I don't even know where or what a chain bookstore is, let alone
anything else...
