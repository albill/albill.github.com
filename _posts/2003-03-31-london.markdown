So, I&apos;m going to be in London at the British Museum during my 10+ hour layover... If I wanted to buy a UK science fiction novel (half the stuff I read is from the UK these days), it seems a good time to get one. But where? I don&apos;t even know where or what a chain bookstore is, let alone anything else...
