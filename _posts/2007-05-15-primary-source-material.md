I've been waiting to hear from the Ransom Center about my request for copies of some of the Golden Dawn documents that they have.



After I made that request, through my amazing powers of occult networking, I managed to find copies of the <strong>same</strong> materials in the hands of a third party. Said party made copies for me and sent them to me last week. They finally arrived today.



I now have copies of the first few volumes of J.F.C. Fuller's Golden Dawn notebooks from 1906-1907. These were, in turn, copied from Allan Bennett's own Golden Dawn notebooks, which were in Aleister Crowley's possesion, presumably after Bennett moved to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) as a Buddhist monk.



I wasn't 100% certain that this was the source from which Fuller copied until I received the material and saw the below in the first few pages of the first volume:

<p align="center"><img src="/images/fuller-notice.png" title="Fuller's Notice" alt="Fuller's Notice" border="1" height="410" width="390" /></p>

Needless to say, having access to primary source material, since Bennett was an early Golden Dawn member, makes my life much <strong>much</strong> easier for my Master's thesis.
