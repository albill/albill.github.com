R and I attended Christmas Mass this year. Of course, it was the <a href="http://oto-usa.org/index.html">Ordo Templi Orientis</a>' <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/sabazius/gnostic_mass.htm">Gnostic Mass</a>, the public ritual of the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica of the order. We had a priest and priestess that I hadn't seen perform mass before.

There is always a Yule mass but it was luck of the draw that it fell on Christmas this year. Afterwards, there was a very nice potluck with our OTO body. I got to talk to Bro. Doug about aspects of our masonic involvement (since he's past master of the lodge that I joined) and the affiliated masonic orders.

Earlier in the day, we had lunch with my grandparents and did our gift exchange with them. R commented on how I crack my grandmother up. She's a relatively conservative Christian woman but there is a family sense of humor and sarcasm (I don't exist in a vacumn) and R noticed that grandma seemed to be working not to laugh at some of the things I said as we discussed family and (dead or nearly) friends of the family.

Following the mass, we rushed over to see Rubylou and company. I got to see baby Elizabeth for the first time. I even got to play with her a little and carry her about. Food and conversation were good and we finally toddled off to home around 9:00 PM. It was quite a long Christmas day for the non-Christians.
