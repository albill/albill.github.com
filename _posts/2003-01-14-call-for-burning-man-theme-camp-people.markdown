![image](http://www.arcanology.com/images/bm.jpg)I've decided that I
really do want to go to Burning Man this year. I find the theme to be
engaging enough that I'm having ideas for a theme camp relating to
ritual work and imagry. Building a small art project as part of it would
be good and I think that I could do so. I need to try to find three or
four other interested parties (the more the merrier to a certain degree)
to try to put something together. People of a Neopagan or magical bent
would be best. Perhaps someone on my friends list is interested in going
to BM again or for the first time? The theme this year is as follows:

> "Beyond belief, beyond the dogmas, creeds, and metaphysical ideas of
> religion, there exists immediate experience. It is from this primal
> world that living faith arises. The intention of Beyond Belief is to
> explore this realm.In 2003 we will invite participants to create
> interactive rites, ritual processions, elaborate images, shrines,
> icons and temples: visions of realities profoundly other and far
> greater than our conscious selves. Our theme will occupy that
> ambiguous territory that lies between reverence and ridicule, faith
> and belief, the absurd and the dazzlingly sublime. The human urge to
> make events, objects, actions and personalities sacred is protean. It
> can fix on and inhabit anything. This year we'll release that spirit
> to discover what it means."

Anyone game for this?
