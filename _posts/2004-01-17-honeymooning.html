Since R and I are still planning, however loosely, to get married this year, we've been discussing honeymoon possibilities.

I'm still fairly intent on Italy, since we went to Greece last year. I'd love to see Rome, Venice, Florence, etc. R would <strong>really</strong> like to go to Turkey but we're not sure about American tourists travelling in Turkey with Iraq next door and the fact that much of Turkey, outside of the cities, is your typical Turkish muslim sort of thing, which might not be feeling real friendly right now...

Once possibility is Thailand. I just found one friendly acquaintance of mine's travel report from her honeymoon there at <a href="http://www.updegrave.com/thailand/honeymoonreport.htm">http://www.updegrave.com/thailand/honeymoonreport.htm</a>
