I ran into this quote today and it seemed quite relevant to some of the issues with our society.
<blockquote>“If you want to really hurt your parents, and you don’t have the nerve to be gay, the least you can do is go into the arts. I’m not kidding. The arts are no way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven’s sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something.”

-- <cite>Kurt Vonnegut</cite></blockquote>
This brings to mind my favorite quote from Bruce Sterling as well:
<blockquote>Don’t become a well-rounded person. Well rounded people are smooth and dull. Become a thoroughly spiky person. Grow spikes from every angle. Stick in their throats like a pufferfish. If you want to woo the muse of the odd, don’t read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>. Read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Webster">Webster</a>’s revenge plays.  Don’t read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer">Homer</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle</a>. Read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus">Herodotus</a> where he’s off talking about <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/text?lookup=hdt.+2.46&amp;vers=Loeb">Egyptian women having public sex with goats</a>.  If you want to read about myth don’t read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell">Joseph Campbell</a>, read about convulsive religion, read about voodoo and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millerites">Millerites</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnster_Rebellion">Munster Anabaptists</a>. There are hundreds of years of extremities, there are vast legacies of mutants. There have always been geeks. There will always be geeks. Become the apotheosis of geek. Learn who your spiritual ancestors were. You didn’t come here from nowhere. There are reasons why you’re here. Learn those reasons. Learn about the stuff that was buried because it was too experimental or embarrassing or inexplicable.
