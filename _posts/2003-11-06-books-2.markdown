I found a copy of **Plato's Cosmology** by Francis Cornford this
evening. This is an entire book published in 1935 on the **Timaeus** of
Plato and understanding and decoding all of the symbology and cosmology
within it. An essential text for your Neoplatonic magician! I also
retrieved my university library copy of **The Origins of Alchemy in
Graeco-Roman Egypt**, which came heavily recommended to me and others by
Nigel Jackson.
