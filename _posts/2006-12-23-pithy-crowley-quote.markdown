I found this pithy quote from ol' Uncle Aleister today:

> I admit that my visions can never mean to other men as much as they do
> to me. I do not regret this. All I ask is that my results should
> convince seekers after truth that there is beyond doubt something
> worth while seeking, attainable by methods more or less like mine. I
> do not want to father a flock, to be the fetish of fools and fanatics,
> or the founder of a faith whose followers are content to echo my
> opinions. I want each man to cut his own way through the jungle.

- [**The Confessions of Aleister
Crowley**](http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/confess/), [Chapter.
66](http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/confess/chapter66.html) Makes one
ponder the fruits of his labor and the work of his followers.
