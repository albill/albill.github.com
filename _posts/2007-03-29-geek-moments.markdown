We had this conversation in the kitchen area at work yesterday about
Star Wars. Now, by some accounts, that might be bad enough but this is a
tech company after all... What we wound up discussing was spin-off
novels because I've been talking online to Sean Williams recently, who
has co-written a trilogy of them and has more coming out in the next
year. So, you had a bunch of geeks standing in the kitchen of a Bay Area
startup debating continuity in comparing Star Wars novels read as a
child (like **Splinter of the Mind's Eye** or the Han Solo series of
books) with the current "Expanded Universe" continuity. The general
consensus is that Lucas used to let people have a lot more fun. Also,
many of us are closet Star Wars fans who had our childhood memories
burned, crushed, and then eviscerated by the combination of the re-edits
of the original movies followed by the abysmal prequels that should have
been just left to novels or not at all. [Remember, Han shot
first!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_shot_first)
