We made the pilgrimage to Ikea last night. I needed another bookcase for my library in order to get the books off of the floor and that's the place to go. Of course, we also left with about nine feet of curtains, a 108" curtain rod and five small tea-light holders. Such is the Way of Ikea.

Last night I made the decision to keep studying with the Pema Kilaya sangha here in Seattle. This is a group that I've been loosely associated with run by <a href="http://www.kilung.org">Kilung Rinpoche</a>. He's a Nyingma lama but very much a traditionalist in certain ways, some of them less compatible than others. My sympathies run more to the Dzogchen Community and Namkhai Norbu in the realm of things Buddhist normally but it would be foolish, I decided, to lose the chance to work in a small group setting with a recognized and well-regarded Nyingma lama just because he's a bit orthodox. The group is focusing on <a href="http://www.geocities.com/scimah/Lojong.htm">Lojong</a> meditation for the time being and I figure that it can't hurt to practice it.

This next weekend is Notocon in Portland. R and I will be driving down there on Friday afternoon to spend the weekend with the OTO. The week after that is our BBQ at our place. If you are local to us and don't know what the hell I'm talking about, ask me!

I realized today that I'm out of town for three of the four weekends in September. Daaaaaamn.
<ul>
	<li>September 5 - Astrum Sophia trip to Minneapolis</li>
	<li>September 9 through 14 - Dzogchen Community retreat with Namkhai Norbu in Conway</li>
	<li>September 25 through 28 - Twilight Gathering festival in Mendocino Woods in California</li>
</ul>
That's a lot of trips...
