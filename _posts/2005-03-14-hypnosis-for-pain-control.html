<h2><strong>Brain Imaging Studies Investigate Pain Reduction By Hypnosis</strong></h2>
<p>Although hypnosis has been shown to reduce pain perception, it is not clear 
how the technique works. Identifying a sound, scientific explanation for 
hypnosis&#39; effect might increase acceptance and use of this safe pain-reduction 
option in clinical settings.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Iowa Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of 
Medicine and the Technical University of Aachen, Germany, used functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to find out if hypnosis alters brain activity 
in a way that might explain pain reduction. The results are reported in the 
November-December 2004 issue of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine.</p>
<p>The researchers found that volunteers under hypnosis experienced significant 
pain reduction in response to painful heat. They also had a distinctly different 
pattern of brain activity compared to when they were not hypnotized and 
experienced the painful heat. The changes in brain activity suggest that 
hypnosis somehow blocks the pain signal from getting to the parts of the brain 
that perceive pain.</p>
<p>&quot;The major finding from our study, which used fMRI for the first time to 
investigate brain activity under hypnosis for pain suppression, is that we see 
reduced activity in areas of the pain network and increased activity in other 
areas of the brain under hypnosis,&quot; said Sebastian Schulz-Stubner, M.D., Ph.D., 
UI assistant professor (clinical) of anesthesia and first author of the study. 
&quot;The increased activity might be specific for hypnosis or might be non-specific, 
but it definitely does something to reduce the pain signal input into the 
cortical structure.&quot;</p>
<p>The pain network functions like a relay system with an input pain signal from 
a peripheral nerve going to the spinal cord where the information is processed 
and passed on to the brain stem. From there the signal goes to the mid-brain 
region and finally into the cortical brain region that deals with conscious 
perception of external stimuli like pain.</p>
<p>Processing of the pain signal through the lower parts of the pain network 
looked the same in the brain images for both hypnotized and non-hypnotized 
trials, but activity in the top level of the network, which would be responsible 
for &quot;feeling&quot; the pain, was reduced under hypnosis. </p>
<p>Initially, 12 volunteers at the Technical University of Aachen had a heating 
device placed on their skin to determine the temperature that each volunteer 
considered painful (8 out of 10 on a 0 to 10 pain scale). The volunteers were 
then split into two groups. One group was hypnotized, placed in the fMRI machine 
and their brain activity scanned while the painful thermal stimuli was applied. 
Then the hypnotic state was broken and a second fMRI scan was performed without 
hypnosis while the same painful heat was again applied to the volunteer&#39;s skin. 
The second group underwent their first fMRI scan without hypnosis followed by a 
second scan under hypnosis. </p>
<p>Hypnosis was successful in reducing pain perception for all 12 participants. 
Hypnotized volunteers reported either no pain or significantly reduced pain 
(less than 3 on the 0-10 pain scale) in response to the painful heat.</p>
<p>Under hypnosis, fMRI showed that brain activity was reduced in areas of the 
pain network, including the primary sensory cortex, which is responsible for 
pain perception.</p>
<p>The imaging studies also showed increased activation in two other brain 
structures -- the left anterior cingulate cortex and the basal ganglia. The 
researchers speculate that increased activity in these two regions may be part 
of an inhibition pathway that blocks the pain signal from reaching the higher 
cortical structures responsible for pain perception. However, Schulz-Stubner 
noted that more detailed fMRI images are needed to definitively identify the 
exact areas involved in hypnosis-induced pain reduction, and he hoped that the 
newer generation of fMRI machines would be capable of providing more answers.</p>
<p>&quot;Imaging studies like this one improve our understanding of what might be 
going on and help researchers ask even more specific questions aimed at 
identifying the underlying mechanism,&quot; Schulz-Stubner said. &quot;It is one piece of 
the puzzle that moves us a little closer to a final answer for how hypnosis 
really works.</p>
<p>&quot;More practically, for clinical use, it helps to dispel prejudice about 
hypnosis as a technique to manage pain because we can show an objective, 
measurable change in brain activity linked to a reduced perception of pain,&quot; he 
added.</p>
