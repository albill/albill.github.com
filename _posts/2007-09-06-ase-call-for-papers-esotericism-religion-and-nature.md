I'm posting this as a member of the Association for the Study of Esotericism. I attended the 2006 conference at the University of California, Davis, and had a very good time. This is the general area that my Master's thesis is within so I may see about creating a paper for this if I can think of a good topic.
<h2>Association for the Study of Esotericism
Third International Conference</h2>
<h3>May 29 - June 1, 2008</h3>
<h3>Call for Papers: Esotericism, Religion, and Nature</h3><lj-cut text="Don't read this suuuuuuper long thing">
The Association for the Study of Esotericism (ASE) is seeking paper and panel proposals for its third International North American Conference on Esotericism to be held at the College of Charleston, in Charleston, SC.

We are seeking proposals on topics in Western Esotericism, particularly related to themes exploring the relationship between esotericism, religion, and nature. Papers may focus on any one of these topics or on a specific conjunction of topics especially as it relates to esotericism. We are also interested in other topics in the study of esotericism and invite proposals on magic, alchemy, astrology, ritual practice, esotericism and mysticism, spiritualism, occultism, hermetic thought, neo-paganism, contemporary esoteric movements and teachers, Asian influences on Western traditions, and other related topics.

We welcome scholars from a wide range of perspectives, including anthropology, American studies, art history, history, religious studies, literature, philosophy, psychology, medieval studies, sociology-the full range of academic disciplines and fields that bear upon the study of esotericism. ASE regards esotericism as an interdisciplinary field of research and we invite scholars from all disciplines to share their research and writings in support of a cross-fertilization of perspectives. In order to encourage graduate study in the field, we will offer a modest prize for the best graduate student paper presented.

If you wish to submit a paper proposal for review and possible presentation at the conference, please send it by regular email to <a href="mailto:ASEconf2008@yahoo.com">ASEconf2008@yahoo.com</a>.

The deadline for panel or paper proposal submission is 15 December, 2007.

No attachments, please: simply copy and paste your abstract into plain text email. Abstracts should be limited to a paragraph, or at most to one single-spaced page, and indicate academic affiliation and/or other academic qualifications. Independent scholars are welcome to submit proposals. Please note that our previous conference was at maximum capacity, so it is best to submit your proposal sooner rather than later to avoid being disappointed. We hope to post a preliminary list of accepted proposals early in 2008. Possible venues for the publication of conference papers include the ASE Conference Book Series, <a href="http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/">Esoterica</a> (the ASE on-line journal), and the Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature and Culture .

For more information on the ASE, see our website at <a href="http://www.aseweb.org">www.aseweb.org</a> . An additional announcement will be forthcoming on the 2008 ASE conference, with information on location, hotels, and conference registration for speakers and ASE members. This event is co-sponsored with the Department of Religious Studies, the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, the Provost Office of the College of Charleston, and the International Society for the Study of Religion, Nature, and Culture (ISSRNC), administered at the University of Florida, <a href="http://religionandnature.com/society">http://religionandnature.com/society</a>.
