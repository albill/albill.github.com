This is the face of terror and I don't mean the poor fucker in the
orange jumpsuit. He may or may not have done anything. He may or may not
ever get a real day in court with a judge and lawyer facing his accusers
but this treatment (of a fellow citizen!) is horrific. It's a wonder
that he hasn't gone insane in isolation. This is us in the mirror,
folks.
