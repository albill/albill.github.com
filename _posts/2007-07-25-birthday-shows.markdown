In a rare occurrence, the DNA Lounge in San Francisco is having shows
twice in a week that I actually want to see... The last time I saw a
show there was when R and I went to see [Front Line
Assembly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Line_Assembly) last year.
On August 14, they are having [Combichrist](http://www.combichrist.com/)
and [Imperative Reaction](http://www.imperativereaction.net/) in a show.
I'm a big fan of Imperative Reaction and I like Combichrist quite a bit.
On my birthday, August 19, they are having a show with [Android
Lust](http://www.androidlust.com/). I've been wanting to see Android
Lust play for quite a while so this ought to be fun.

Jisho Sensei will be visiting that weekend. Maybe he'd be up for a
little Industrial... **Update:** Android Lust's music can be sampled on
the band's [myspace page](http://www.myspace.com/androidlust).
