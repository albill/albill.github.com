I went to the local Dzogchen Community's get-together tonight, which was the transmission for Guru Rinpoche. The community does a transmission of practice worldwide every four months, roughly, for various figures. It was a good chance to get to talk to people, practice together and to find out who's going to the retreat in Conway and what else is up. I got to pick a couple of longterm students of Norbu's minds about the Dzogchen Community and practice. Cool stuff.
