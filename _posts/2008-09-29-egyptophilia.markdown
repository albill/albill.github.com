Or is it "Aeqyptophilia" in better faux Latin?

On Friday, R and I leave for Egypt for something like 11 days of travel there. On the advice of some good friends of ours, Denny and Sophia, who have been there, we're going to travel through a local, Egyptian-based, tour company that they used. It's one of these fly by night, cash exchanged from cars, kind of outfits but they had a great time with the outfit and they seem fairly reliable. They actually are picking us up at the airport in Cairo even though we don't start the tour with them for two days after that.

We'll have to figure out what to do in those two days (or probably day and change with jetlag and such). Since we're already going to the big Egyptian museum and seeing the pyramids with the tour guys (aka "the Egyptian Mafia"), we probably won't do things like that. We're open to suggestions though.

Our itinerary right now is:

<strong>Oct 04</strong>: Arrival to Cairo airport (near midnight), then transfer to the hotel, overnight in Cairo.
<strong>Oct 05</strong>: Free day, overnight in Cairo.

If anyone has any tips for Egyptian travel, it isn't too late to tell us. I've been told to be financially wary of the camel drivers, especially, in Cairo. I'm told that you should expect to give small amounts of money to people pretty much constantly for things.

On the way home, we're stopping by London for three days of high speed tourism, including a long visit to the British Museum.
