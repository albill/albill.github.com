I always find it amazing how little practice some people put into the spirit of fraternity. I know and have known many people who were members of fraternal orders (occult or mundane) which emphasized brotherhood, solidarity, respect for fellow members, and similar and so many of these people seem to give lip service to it and nothing else. What do they think it is about? Is it just a social game for them? Are the oaths of fraternity just words that come out of their mouths to conveniently get them in the club.

I'm hardly perfect and have made serious mistakes in the past but I strive to live up to the bonds of fraternity that I freely enter thereby treating all men as brothers and all women as sisters who share these bonds.

It's always disappointing when I receive yet more confirmation that these bonds don't seem as terribly important to others and are just yet another arena for social games and politics.
