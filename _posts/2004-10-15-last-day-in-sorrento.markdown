We surrender the keys to our apartment in the next hour or so and then
we're off to Rome. Yesterday, R and I went on a tour that we signed up
for to Pompeii and Vesuvius. Pompeii was pretty interesting and far
larger than I expected it to be. The ruins are in very good shape,
overall, and I expect that some of the damage that we see is actually
from being uncovered for much of the last 200 years... I took many
pictures, which I will eventually post. In the afternoon, after a lunch
where I found the only pro-Bush Canadian, we went to Vesuvius. I wasn't
really into climbing it as it was't a huge interest to me but R climbed
up to the rim and looked into the caldera. She took some pictures as
well. All in all, it was an ok tour. The bus full of mostly older
Americans was a bit odd but we weren't the only youngish people there. I
think it worked out a lot better than taking the train over to Pompeii
and just wandering around would have...
