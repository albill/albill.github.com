R and I just got back from celebrating Yule with our friends, the Sargents. Denny and Rebecca live fairly close to us and are the couple with the yurt in a wooded area of their back yard. We've been celebrating full moons with them for the last year or so and they hold a yule ritual and celebration at their place every year. I've gone to this for a while. Denny has written a couple of popular books on either global ritualism or western occult work. Rebecca, under her writing name, has written a series of books for the "girlfriend witch" market (as she calls it). They are both wonderful people and good friends. During the rite, we do a fairly short clearing of space using five PHAT syllables in the five directions, a bit of mantra repetition, and then we read a poem titled "Sol Invictus" about (you guessed it) the unconquerable sun. We then each light a candle off of the main flame in the center of our circle. As we individually light our flames in turn, each of us does an invocation for the coming year. We then do a bit more mantra chanting and then close. I took a couple of pictures of our lit altar after we were finished lighting our candles. The disc in the middle is a Tibetan mirror. <p align="center">

Most people were pulling a single card from a tarot deck going around but Denny, myself, and another did I Ching castings. The one I cast was this:

The first third and sixth lines were movable or "old" when thrown as well. I'll save my interpretation but I am still learning to work with the I Ching. After the ritual, we spent the next few hours with people hanging out, exchanging a few gifts and otherwise having a good time together. Hot buttered rum, tea, champagne and various other drinks were consumed (though not all by everyone). R took a happy holiday photo of me as we relaxed afterwards... <p align="center">
