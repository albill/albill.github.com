As you can see above (or
[here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTLorh-D9mI)), the Olympic torch
route is continuing to have protests. This is footage from Katmandu of
the crowds of protesters there. It is shameful to see Nepalese police
kicking Buddhist monks (though not surprising in a protest situation).
It seems unlikely that the situation leading to the Beijing Olympics is
going to calm down at any point. It makes me wonder if we might see
incidents at the actual olympic events. I do hope that the Chinese don't
go completely overboard in their response to protests but the recent
events in Tibet make it seem pretty doubtful that restraint will be
shown.
