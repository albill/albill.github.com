<p>I got my first paper for my graduate literature class focusing on the self 
back. This is from the professor that people have told me is a difficult grader 
(his class is the only one that some of my acquaintances have gotten a &#39;B&#39; or lower 
in). I had to write this paper in a hurry because my trip to Wisconsin was the 
same week as the week where I&#39;d normally be writing this and my History paper 
was due just a few days before I wrote my Literature paper. Needless to say, I 
was worried about my grade because I wrote the paper in effectively two drafts 
plus proofing by R (thank you!) for errors and comprehension.</p>
<p>He has a number of inline comments on specific questions or issues but this 
is what he put at the head of the paper. I&#39;ve asked him to elucidate the 
difference between A- and AB material so I can gain a fuller understanding but 
I&#39;m pretty satisfied with this grade. I&#39;ll have to take more risks, it seems on 
the next paper.</p>
<p>The comments:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Hi Al. This one’s a <u>very</u> strong start—I have an A- (3.66 GPA) on 
	it, though I waffled between A- and AB (3.5 GPA). You write a graceful and 
	sophisticated style, and your analysis of Conrad’s story is apt and 
	convincing. Its only shortcoming is that your interpretation is a little on 
	the mainstream side. Not that that’s all bad—your reading is sensible and 
	fully in line with most of Conrad’s better critics and readers—but it does 
	suggest that you might want to try lining up a more ambitious thesis or more 
	independent slant on your next essay. Generally, the only difference I see 
	between, say, and A- and an A paper is not so much one of execution as it is 
	of conception—an A- is usually pretty well executed, but doesn’t always have 
	the originality or probing depth of an A paper. Still, the thesis you 
	explore here does an excellent job of allowing you to link your reading to 
	the “self” theme, and you’re off and running at a good clip! Keep it up!
