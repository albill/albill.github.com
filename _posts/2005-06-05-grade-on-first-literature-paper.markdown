                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I got my first paper for my graduate literature class focusing on the self back. This is from the professor that people have told me is a difficult grader (his class is the only one that some of my acquaintances have gotten a 'B' or lower in). I had to write this paper in a hurry because my trip to Wisconsin was the same week as the week where I'd normally be writing this and my History paper was due just a few days before I wrote my Literature paper. Needless to say, I was worried about my grade because I wrote the paper in effectively two drafts plus proofing by R (thank you!) for errors and comprehension.

I've asked him to elucidate the difference between A- and AB material so I can gain a fuller understanding but I'm pretty satisfied with this grade. I'll have to take more risks, it seems on the next paper.

This one’s a <u>very</u> strong start—I have an A- (3.66 GPA) on it, though I waffled between A- and AB (3.5 GPA). You write a graceful and sophisticated style, and your analysis of Conrad’s story is apt and convincing. Its only shortcoming is that your interpretation is a little on the mainstream side. Not that that’s all bad—your reading is sensible and fully in line with most of Conrad’s better critics and readers—but it does suggest that you might want to try lining up a more ambitious thesis or more independent slant on your next essay. Generally, the only difference I see between, say, and A- and an A paper is not so much one of execution as it is of conception—an A- is usually pretty well executed, but doesn’t always have the originality or probing depth of an A paper. Still, the thesis you explore here does an excellent job of allowing you to link your reading to the “self” theme, and you’re off and running at a good clip! Keep it up!
