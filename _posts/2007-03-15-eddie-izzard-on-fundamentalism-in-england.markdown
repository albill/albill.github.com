Eddie Izzard has the following to say about fundamentalism in England:

> There's no Church of England fundamentalism. We can't have Church of
> England fundamentalism. You know, like they have Islamic
> fundamentalism. Jihad! … Ah ha … Church of England fundamentalism is
> impossible because you can't have: "You must have tea and cake with
> the vicar... or you die!" Tea and cake or death! Students with beards,
> "Tea and cake or death! Tea and cake or death! Little Red Cookbook!
> Little Red Cookbook!" Ca – you know, 'cause, "Cake or death?" That's a
> pretty easy question. Everybody – anyone could answer that. "Cake or
> death?" "Uhh, cake please." "Very well! Give him cake!" "Oh, thanks
> very much. It's very nice!" [*points*] "You! Cake or death?" "Uh, cake
> for me, too, please!" "Very well! Give him cake, too! We're gonna run
> out of cake at this rate. [*points*] You! Cake or death?" "Uh, death,
> please. No, cake! Cake! Cake, sorry. Sorry …" "You said death first,
> ahaaa, ahaaaa, death first!" "Well, I meant cake!" "Oh, alllll right.
> You're lucky I'm Church of England! Cake or death?" "Uh, cake please."
> "Well, we're out of cake! We only had three bits and we didn't expect
> such a rush! So what'll it be?" "What, so my choice is 'or death?'
> Well, then I'll have the chicken, please."
