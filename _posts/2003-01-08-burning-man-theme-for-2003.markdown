This is a quote from Larry Harvey on this year's theme:
<blockquote>"Beyond belief, beyond the dogmas, creeds, and metaphysical ideas of religion, there exists immediate experience.  It is from this primal world that living faith arises.  The intention of Beyond Belief is to explore this realm.In 2003 we will invite participants to create interactive rites, ritual processions, elaborate images, shrines, icons and temples: visions of realities profoundly other and far greater than our conscious selves. Our theme will occupy that ambiguous territory that lies between reverence and ridicule, faith and belief, the absurd and the dazzlingly sublime. The human urge to make events, objects, actions and personalities sacred is protean. It can fix on and inhabit anything. This year we'll release that spirit to discover what it means."</blockquote>
Too bad that I probably won't be able to go this year. ;-(
