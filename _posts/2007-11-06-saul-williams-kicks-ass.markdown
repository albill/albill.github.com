I've been enjoying the new Saul Williams album, “[The Inevitable Rise
and Liberation of Niggy Tardust!](http://niggytardust.com/)“, that I
[blogged about the other
day](http://www.arcanology.com/2007/11/01/saul-williams-niggytardust-album-for-download/).
It's a great album and I'm glad that I actually paid money for it to
support his work as an artist. I did want to share the original work
that grabbed Trent Reznor's attention and caused him to seek out Saul
Williams in order to work with him. The song is "[List of
Demands](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1llNYAlYrc)" and I've posted
the video of it below. Good music!
