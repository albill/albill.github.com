<p>My current focus is getting caught up in school right now. I haven't been reading blogs as much because of this.</p>

<p>I'm currently writing a paper on humanism and rationality in Dostoevsky's <b>Notes from Underground</b>. This was due last Friday. After this, I have a paper on political autonomy and the individual for my other class but that one is fairly short.</p>
