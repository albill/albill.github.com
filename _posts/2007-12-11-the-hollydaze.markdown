We are in that special time of the year again. No, I'm not contemplating the futility of existence and my own death (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohatsu">Rohatsu</a> was this last weekend). I'm speaking of the high holy days of consumer shopping. I think that this little video below both sums up my feelings concerning the holidays in some strange manner and also is a nod to a short period in my geek youth, 18 years ago, when I actually did LARP. *shudder* Ok, not really *shudder* except in embarrassment. I had a lot of fun with it and several of my friends did go on to co-found the Camarilla, which was the fan organization for the <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire:_The_Masquerade">Vampire</a></strong> role-playing game. Now <strong>that</strong> would be a *shudder* but luckily, I had nothing to do with it. I'm not sure if the year or so I spent as a cast member for the <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocky_Horror_Picture_Show">Rocky Horror Picture Show</a></strong> qualifies as *shudder* though. Cool, yet tragic, cartoon below... <lj-embed></lj-embed>
