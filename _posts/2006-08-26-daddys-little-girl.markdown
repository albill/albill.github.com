I just picked up Madeline, my daughter, at the Oakland Airport. This was
her first trip by herself on a plane. I attempted to enclose her and
Miss Moppet in the same space but the kitten is just a bit too frisky so
she gets to spend the night sleeping in the bathroom. Since the 15 pound
tomcat still hisses at her and kind of stalks her, I don't want to leave
her and her fresh stiches alone in the night with him (I am referring to
Moppet here, not my daughter...) Tomorrow we will go into the City,
which is what locals call San Francisco when they aren't in it... We
have a few ideas of things to do, like the [Zeum](http://www.zeum.org/).
