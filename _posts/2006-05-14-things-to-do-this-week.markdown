I have to get a bunch of things done this week on my "time off" from
work. Main things:

Pack up 4,000 book library

-   Give away a lot of science fiction paperbacks

Pack up clothing and sundry other items (much smaller than \#1)

Do work on exterior of the house to prep for sale

Make reservations to fly on June 2 or 3 with two housecats

Keep current with my single class for the school term

Maintain practice schedule for Buddhist work

In addition to this, I am meeting with friends during the week for last
hurrahs.

1.  Monday evening - Richard
2.  Tuesday evening - Rubylou
3.  Wednesday evening - Manaman
4.  Thursday evening - ?? Maybe John Mueller

Saturday morning/afternoon, we drive to Portland to spend the night with
friends. Sunday, drive home and do more packing as well as pack for
Wyoming. Monday the 22nd, fly to Wyoming.
