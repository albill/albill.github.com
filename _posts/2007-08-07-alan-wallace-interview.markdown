The podcast, Skeptiko, has an excellent interview with B. Alan Wallace
today. Wallace is one of those Buddhist figures to whom I pay a lot of
attention. He was a monk for 14 years (ordained by the Dalai Lama) and a
well known translator. At the age of 34, he went back to school at
Amherst to finally finish his undergraduate degree, which he had left.
He then went on to Stanford and received a PhD in Religious Studies
there. Among various projects, he's running the Shamatha Project, which
is trying to gather data in a scientific manner on meditation by leading
groups of people through shamatha meditation in controlled groups. The
interview is [here](http://www.skeptiko.com/index.php?id=31).
