An online acquaintance of mine, Bill LaLonde, posted this recently as part of an overall humor series. I couldn't help but repeat it:
<blockquote>A Taoist hermit lived in the mountains. A formal delegation from the Confucian temple below decided to visit and seek his advice. When they arrived at his hut unannounced, they were scandalized to find him completely naked.

"What are you doing meditating in your hut with no pants on?" they demanded.

"The whole world is my hut," he replied. "This small room is my pants. What I want to know is, what are you doing in my pants?"</blockquote>
