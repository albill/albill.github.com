We've received word at [Ace Monster
Toys](http://www.acemonstertoys.org), the nonprofit Oakland Hackerspace
that I helped found, that our 80 watt laser has left its homeland of
China and is now wending its way across the Pacific ocean towards us.
The expected due date is somewhere around May 26. This means that we
should begin getting it set up the week after the Maker Faire.

This is big news for us. This is the most expensive piece of equipment
that we've gotten and it took an investment from a group of people in
order to purchase. It is an Exlas 1280 80 watt CO2 laser. It has a 47
inch by 31 1/2 inch cutting area, which is HUGE. It also weighs in at
almost 800 pounds. It is so big that we're literally putting in a wider
door to the back room of our shop area.

When it was put onto the ship, we were sent a few pictures of it, which
I include below.

I'll post more updates once the laser arrives and is set up at AMT.
