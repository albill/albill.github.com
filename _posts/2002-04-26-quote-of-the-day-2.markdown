A Mr. Boffo cartoon: Mr. Boffo and (Ace) Weederman, the Wonder-Dog, are
sitting on a deserted island in the middle of the ocean. Mr. Boffo is
saying: "Someday, Weederman, we'll look back on all this and laugh. "It
will probably be one of those deep, eerie ones that slowly build to a
blood-curdling maniacal scream...but still it will be a laugh."
