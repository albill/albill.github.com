I just now found the following reference on a page about Blavatsky's <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/cn/blavatskyplagiarisms07jul05.shtml">plagarism of sources</a>:
<blockquote>"I cannot find a single reference to Chatterji’s glossary      in any part of the later Glossary. Nearly all of the matter concerning Egyptian      mythology, etc., in the latter, was copied from Bonwick’s Egyptian Belief      and Modern Thought. A small part of this was credited, but over 100 passages      from Bonwick were not credited."</blockquote>
