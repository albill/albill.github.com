Clarke</a> died today. The <a href="http://www.clarkefoundation.org">Clarke Foundation</a> does not currently have a notice of it up but they do have a <a href="http://www.clarkefoundation.org/acc/biography.php">biography</a> page for him for those unfamiliar with his work. Clarke was on the shortlist of science fiction authors that I read as a child. I remember reading books, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fountains-Paradise-Arthur-C-Clarke/dp/0446677949"><strong>The Fountains of Paradise</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Childhoods-End-Arthur-C-Clarke/dp/0345347951"><strong>Childhood's End</strong></a>, very early on. Out of his work, the latter probably had the most impact on me. Another early memory of mine is my mother taking me to see a showing of <strong>2001: A Space Odyssey</strong> (which he wrote the original story for) at her university. I was probably all of five years old at the time. Authors like Clarke, Asmiov, and Silverberg all stand in a special place in my childhood memories as those that introduced me to science fiction in a major way (alongside Edgar Rice Burroughs and H.P. Lovecraft for my childhood fiction influences). His <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws">three laws</a>, especially the third, are often quoted today in a variety of circumstances: <ol>

When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.

I'll ponder his gifts to us as an author whenever I look at my bookshelves.
