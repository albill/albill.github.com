So, as some of you may remember, I&apos;ve been looking at going to Grad School but have to leave the nice paying job and now getting a house and soon getting married kind of get in the way of that (not to mention the lack of jobs for academics). <a href="http://www.naropa.edu">Naropa University</a> has an online program that includes a couple of MA options. It turns out that they&apos;ll have an MA in Buddhist Studies soon, which would be of interest since I was planning on doing graduate work in religious studies and this area is one of my interests. I could also use this as a springboard to a Religious Studies PhD later. I&apos;ve written to them to ask for their timeline but I think I&apos;ll be watching this one. <a href="http://www.naropa.edu/distance/index.htm">http://www.naropa.edu/distance/</a>.
