I just found <a href="http://fic.ic.org/cmag/95/2595.html">this</a> online (while looking for information on the people mentioned here). I have the issue of <em>Communities</em> magazine with it from 1997 as well. Here are some better images of the structures from the article:

For many many years, I was interested in intentional communities and similar attempts to find other ways to live. When I was younger, the only reason that I didn't wind up involved in one was lack of funds to support doing so. When I was married, we looked into the <a href="http://www.scn.org/pugetridgecohousing/">co-housing community over in West Seattle</a> that Catherine's mother lives at because she was selling her old place. The problem then was poorness. The other issue with it is that you'd pay what you'd pay for a medium sized house and get a small house that was effectively a condo (lots of housing rules and such). The community seemed rather nice though and if I had the money, I'd still consider living there. The commute would be a bitch though.

Anyway, the article above mentions people that are actually relatively local. I'm interested in their building methods. I've thought of getting a few acres somewhere within a couple of hours of here and either camping on it during the summer or, more preferable, putting a cabin or some other structure on it. It would be a great place to use for retreats, ritual work, etc.
