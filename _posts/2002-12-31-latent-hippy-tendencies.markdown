I just found [this](http://fic.ic.org/cmag/95/2595.html) online (while
looking for information on the people mentioned here). I have the issue
of *Communities* magazine with it from 1997 as well. Here are some
better images of the structures from the article: [Yoni-lookin' yoga
studio](http://www.peak.org/~deatech/cobcottage/pics/yoga.jpg). [another
shot of
it](http://www.peak.org/~deatech/cobcottage/pics/cb1-12-1.low.jpg). For
many many years, I was interested in intentional communities and similar
attempts to find other ways to live. When I was younger, the only reason
that I didn't wind up involved in one was lack of funds to support doing
so. When I was married, we looked into the [co-housing community over in
West Seattle](http://www.scn.org/pugetridgecohousing/) that Catherine's
mother lives at because she was selling her old place. The problem then
was poorness. The other issue with it is that you'd pay what you'd pay
for a medium sized house and get a small house that was effectively a
condo (lots of housing rules and such). The community seemed rather nice
though and if I had the money, I'd still consider living there. The
commute would be a bitch though. Anyway, the article above mentions
people that are actually relatively local. I'm interested in their
building methods. I've thought of getting a few acres somewhere within a
couple of hours of here and either camping on it during the summer or,
more preferable, putting a cabin or some other structure on it. It would
be a great place to use for retreats, ritual work, etc.
