R and I went out to Egypt's place (yes, that's a person) on Friday night to attend an Invocation of Ra-Hoor-Khuit to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Equinox of the Gods. Various parties were in attendence Matertiamat, Regulus666, Babalonyieh and many others...). Other than it being quite a bit of a drive from the city since it is out in the next county away from any major towns, it was kind of nice to get out into the country. Egypt has about an acre with a small house on it and a tree covered hill out behind it. The top of the hill is largely open and has been cleared as a ritual space. The invocation was performed and the roles were officiated in a superb manner by all. R and I then chatted for a while, had a bit of wine and then headed home. Thus passes the 100th anniversary. The equinox itself was, I believe, around 11:00 PM on Friday night. Yesterday (Saturday), I attended a five hour ngondro and meaning of refuge workshop with Kilung Rinpoche and 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <a href="http://www.pemakilaya.org">Pema Kilaya Sangha</a> (of which I am a member). Rinpoche spoke at length about the meaning of refuge in each of the main three vehicles (Sutra, Mahayana and Vajrayana with Dzogchen included in the context of Vajrayana). He then discussed the ngondro practices a bit, gave us the visualizations used with the refuge tree in the Longchen Nyingtik lineage and had a quiet period of meditation. For those that don't know, the act of taking refuge is where one commits oneself to the Buddhist path. After doing so, one is considered to be a Buddhist. Kilung Rinpoche is one of those that feels that people should study and practice basic meditation for some period of time before taking refuge in order to be sure that this is the right course for them and to make a connection to the tradition. I took refuge in the summer of 2001 with the local <a href="http://www.sakya.org">Sakya</a> monastery after beginning to practice. I had been reading books and otherwise intellectually examining Tibetan Buddhism for some years before that. Generally speaking though, I feel the most connection to the Nyingma school of practice within Tibetan Buddhism. Crazy tantrics up in the hills and all that. Yesterday evening, after I came home from the workshop, R and I did a Golden Dawn-based ritual for the Equinox that my ex-whatever, Lesa, had rewritten for two people (a man and a woman) back in 1998 and which we had done back then. R has been interested in doing more ritual work with me and I still had a copy of the ritual on file. It was actually quite interesting to look at it as I hadn't examined it closely in some years. A number of the ritual techniques in it (such as pentagram rituals) are things that I haven't done in some years since I joined the Aurum Solis and switched the focus of my practice to a more Ogdoadic context. It's amazing how it all comes back to you though. A little prompting before the ritual and I could remember all of the ritual forms. The ritual itself uses some of the Cadmon imagry that Lesa and I were working with at that time as part of our project (my project??) for the Church of the Cadmon. This was a post-Golden Dawn fusion of Hermetic imagery and magical practice that we worked on together as I tried to create a mass for the elements of the body of the Cadmon. The original group that is now my Astrum Sophia working group with and was an outgrowth of a study group that Lesa and I ran on Hermetic magic and Qabalah using John Michael Greer's early books as a basis. That eventually became a working group that was originally founded under the moniker of the "Cor Cadmonis." Doing this ritual brought much of that earlier work back to me. The ritual went well and R and I are discussing other ritual work that we might do together. A ganapuja, at the very least, is likely. Today, I slept in a bit and then hung around the house for a while with R. The space is much nicer than it was a few days ago as R hung up much of our artwork while I was at the workshop yesterday. There is a lot of Hermetic, Classical or Tibetan stuff on various walls now. I am still planning on painting our very white main bathroom in the near future. I went down to the University District to get some obscure books that I had photocopied spiral-bound at a copy shop and visit the used book stores. That accomplished, I'm home now for the evening. Tomorrow, I am taking the day off from work. I haven't made specific plans for that time though I may try to repair the semi-functional Tivo device. Damn linux.
