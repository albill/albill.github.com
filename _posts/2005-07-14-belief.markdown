Do I believe in angels, demons, gods, bodhisattvas and what-not?

Do I believe with the unquestioning exuberance that people often seem to think our ancestors (or those of other peoples) felt for these topics? Well, no. Ours is a different age and a different culture. Beliefs and practice adapt to the times as much or more than we adapt ourselves to these beliefs. Outside of fundamentalist or zealot circles of suicide and abortion clinic bombers (or the snipers of doctors), one finds few bastions of unquestioning belief.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        That being said, I do not for a minute believe that the people of previous centuries unquestionably believed things either. Sure, there have always been extremely pious individuals who believe fervently and without question. Those people have always been rare, I think. Some have been saints but I'm sure some have been inquisitors as well or the kind of people that would stone a sufi to death for the wrong sort of proclamation. We aren't any more intelligent (except by nutrition and the like) than the people that came before us. Depending on the person and class, we may be more or less educated but I have always strongly believed in the principle of mediocrity, usually applied to astronomy. There is nothing special about this place, the Earth, or our Solar System, they say. We are average or as normal as anything else, not exceptional. The same applies to human beings. Those primitives of 2,000 years or 6,000 years ago weren't any different than you, me, or our families. There are levels of complexity in culture but the fundamental wetware is the same. This is why I've always rejected the arguments of Julian Jaynes. They don't match the historical record and they don't match my experiences of people. Why should I think people of other generations had different concerns or different ways of thinking?

It's a lot easier to be an educated person and a zealot when you only know of one or two alternatives and those are of other peoples or nations that you may be at occasional war with anyway.

Does this mean I believe in literal energy fields or angels with wings and their ilk? Well, no, but no more than I would expect people to think that the Christian God is a greybeard on a sapphire throne. Literalism is an insidious disease after all.

It is always hard to separate superstition and folklore from truth but culture is constantly evolving and changing so I doubt if anyone would have it more easily either. The main issue that I see there is the lack of value that our culture places on any spiritual impulse in thinking people. If you have such beliefs, of any sort, you are immediately put in the same box as the Fundamentalists. The only other option is to go in the box labeled "Kook", which is hardly much of an improvement.

The alternative is rather sterile.
