# Lojong

Lojong (Tib. བློ་སྦྱོང་) is a mind training practice in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition based on a set of aphorisms formulated in Tibet in the 12th century by Geshe Chekhawa. The practice involves refining and purifying one's motivations and attitudes.

The fifty-nine or so slogans that form the root text of the mind training practice are designed as a set of antidotes to undesired mental habits that cause suffering. They contain both methods to expand one's viewpoint towards absolute bodhicitta, such as "Find the consciousness you had before you were born" and "Treat everything you perceive as a dream", and methods for relating to the world in a more constructive way with relative bodhicitta, such as "Be grateful to everyone" and "When everything goes wrong, treat disaster as a way to wake up."་

## The Root Text

The original Lojong practice consists of 59 slogans, or aphorisms. These slogans are further organized into seven groupings, called the '7 Points of Lojong.' The categorized slogans are listed below, translated by the Nalanda Translation Committee under the direction of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche. It is emphasized that the following is translated from ancient Sanskrit and Tibetan texts, and therefore may vary slightly from other translations. Some slogans may feel esoteric or difficult to comprehend. 


### SEVEN POINT MIND TRAINING

#### by CHEKAWA YESHE DORJE (1101-1175)

*The translation of the root text has been sourced from 'Mind Training – The Great Collection' translated by Thupten Jinpa.*

Because of my numerous aspirations, <br />
I have defied the tragic tale of suffering <br />
And have taken instructions to subdue self-grasping. <br />
Now, even if death comes, I have no regrets.

### Seven-Point Mind Training

#### 1. PRESENTATION OF THE PRELIMINARIES, THE BASIS

First, train in the preliminaries.

#### 2. TRAINING IN THE TWO MINDS OF AWAKENING, THE MAIN PRACTICE

2A. Training in the ultimate awakening mind

2A1. The actual meditation session

Train to view all phenomena as dreamlike. <br />
Examine the nature of the unborn awareness. <br />
The remedy, too, is freed in its own place. <br />
Place your mind on the basis-of-all, the actual path.

2A2. The subsequent period [practices]

In the intervals be a conjurer of illusions.

2B. Training in the conventional awakening mind

2B1. The meditation session

Train in the two – giving and taking – alternately.

Place the two astride the breath.

2B2. The subsequent period [practices]

There are three objects, three poisons, and three roots of virtue. <br />
In all actions, train by means of the words.

3. TAKING ADVERSE CONDITIONS ONTO THE PATH OF ENLIGHTENMENT

When the world and its inhabitants boil with negativity, <br />
Transform adverse conditions into the path of enlightenment.

3A. Training in the two awakening minds, the extraordinary thoughts

3A1. Taking adverse conditions onto the path by means of training in the conventional awakening mind

3A1A. Recognizing your own self as the enemy

Banish all blames to the single source.

3A1B. Recognizing sentient beings as friends and cherishing them

Toward all beings contemplate their great kindness.

3A2. Taking adverse conditions onto the path by means of training in the ultimate awakening mind

With the three views and treasury of space, <br />
The protection of yoga is unexcelled. <br />
By meditating on illusions as the four buddha bodies, <br />
Emptiness is protection unsurpassed.

3B. Striving in the dual practice of accumulation and purification, the extraordinary activities

The fourfold practice is the most excellent method.

1. Accumulation of merit
2. Purification of negative karma
3. Making offerings to malevolent forces
4. Offering torma to the Dharma protectors

Relate whatever you can to meditation right now.

#### 4. PRESENTATION OF A LIFETIME'S PRACTICE IN SUMMARY

In brief the essence of instruction is this:

Apply yourself to the five powers.

1. Propelling intention
2. Acquaintance
3. Positive seed
4. Eradication
5. Aspirational prayer

As Mahayana's transference method is the five powers alone, their practice is vital.

1. Positive seed
2. Aspirational prayer
3. Eradication
4. Propelling intention
5. Acquaintance


#### 5. PRESENTATION OF THE MEASURE OF HAVING TRAINED THE MIND

The intent of all teachings converges on a single point.

Of the two witnesses uphold the principal one.

1. Not being disapproved of by those who are reputedly sublime
2. Not being the object of your own disapproval

Cultivate constantly the joyful mind alone.

If this can be done even when distracted, you are trained.

#### 6. PRESENTATION OF THE COMMITMENTS OF MIND TRAINING

Train constantly in the three general points.

1. Your mind training should not contradict your pledges
2. Your mind training should not become offensive
3. Your mind training should not be biased

Transform your attitudes but remain as you are.

Do not speak of the defects [of others].

Do not reflect on others' shortcomings.

Discard all expectations of reward.

Discard poisonous food.

Do not maintain [inappropriate] loyalty.

Do not torment with malicious banter.

Do not lie in ambush.

Do not strike at the heart.

Do not place the load of a dzo on an ox.

Do not sprint to win a race.

Do not abuse this [practice] as a rite.

Do not turn gods into demons.

Do not seek misery as a means to happiness.

#### 7. PRESENTATION OF THE PRECEPTS OF MIND TRAINING

Accomplish all yogas through a single means.

Overcome all errors through a single means.

There are two tasks – one at the start and one at the end.

Forbear whichever of the two arises.

1. Great fortune
2. Misfortune

Guard the two even at the cost of your life.

1. The precepts and commitments presented in the teachings in general
2. The commitments of this particular mind training teaching

Train in the three difficult challenges.

1. Remember the antidotes
2. Overcome the afflictions
3. Eradicate the continuum of the afflictions

Adopt the three principal conditions.

1. There should be a qualified spiritual teacher
2. Your state of mind should be such that many realizations have arisen
3. Conditions conducive to Dharma practice must be gathered

Contemplate the three that are free of degeneration.

1. Make sure that your faith and respect toward your spiritual teacher remain undiminished
2. Make sure that your enthusiasm for mind training remains undiminished
3. Learn to guard your pledges undiminished

Be endowed with the three inseparable factors.

1. Make sure your body is never divorced from virtuous activity at all times
2. Make sure your speech is never divorced from virtuous activity at all times
3. Make sure your mind is never divorced from virtuous activity at all times

Train constantly toward the chosen objects.

Do not depend on other conditions.

Engage in the principal practices right now.

Do not apply misplaced understanding.

1. Misplaced forbearance
2. Misplaced aspiration
3. Misplaced savoring
4. Misplaced compassion
5. Misplaced dedication
6. Misplaced rejoicing

Do not be sporadic.

Train with decisiveness.

Be released through the two: investigation and close analysis.

Do not boast of your good deeds.

Do not be ill-tempered.

Do not be fickle.

Do not be boisterous.

Through this proliferation of the five degenerations,

Transform [every event] into the path of enlightenment.

Because of my numerous aspirations,

I have defied the tragic tale of suffering

And have taken instructions to subdue self-grasping.

Now, even if death comes, I have no regrets.

## Slogans as translated by others

### Slogans as translated by the Nalanda Translation Committee

#### Point One: The preliminaries, which are the basis for dharma practice

Slogan 1. First, train in the preliminaries; The four reminders or alternatively called the Four Thoughts:

3. Recall that whatever you do, whether virtuous or not, has a result; Karma.
4. Contemplate that as long as you are too focused on self-importance and too caught up in thinking about how you are good or bad, you will experience suffering. Obsessing about getting what you want and avoiding what you don't want does not result in happiness; Ego.

Slogan 16. Whatever you meet unexpectedly, join with meditation.

#### Point Four: Showing the Utilization of Practice in One's Whole Life

Slogan 17. Practice the five strengths, the condensed heart instructions.

The 5 strengths are: strong determination, familiarization, the positive seed, reproach, and aspiration.

When you are dying practice the 5 strengths.

Slogan 44. Train in the three difficulties.

Slogan 46. Pay heed that the three never wane: gratitude towards one's teacher, appreciation of the dharma (teachings) and correct conduct.

Slogan 47. Keep the three inseparable: body, speech, and mind.

Slogan 48. Train without bias in all areas. It is crucial always to do this pervasively and wholeheartedly.

Slogan 49. Always meditate on whatever provokes resentment.

Slogan 50. Don't be swayed by external circumstances.

Slogan 51. This time, practice the main points: others before self, dharma, and awakening compassion.

Slogan 52. Don't misinterpret.

The six things that may be misinterpreted are patience, yearning, excitement, compassion, priorities and joy. You're patient when you're getting your way, but not when its difficult. You yearn for worldly things, instead of an open heart and mind. You get excited about wealth and entertainment, instead of your potential for enlightenment. You have compassion for those you like, but none for those you don't. Worldly gain is your priority rather than cultivating loving-kindness and compassion. You feel joy when you enemies suffer, and do not rejoice in others' good fortune.

Slogan 53. Don't vacillate (in your practice of LoJong).

Slogan 54. Train wholeheartedly.

Slogan 55. Liberate yourself by examining and analyzing: Know your own mind with honesty and fearlessness.

Slogan 56. Don't wallow in self-pity.

Slogan 57. Don't be jealous.
