# Lojong

Lojong (Tib. བློ་སྦྱོང་) is a mind training practice in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition based on a set of aphorisms formulated in Tibet in the 12th century by Geshe Chekhawa. The practice involves refining and purifying one's motivations and attitudes.

The fifty-nine or so slogans that form the root text of the mind training practice are designed as a set of antidotes to undesired mental habits that cause suffering. They contain both methods to expand one's viewpoint towards absolute bodhicitta, such as "Find the consciousness you had before you were born" and "Treat everything you perceive as a dream", and methods for relating to the world in a more constructive way with relative bodhicitta, such as "Be grateful to everyone" and "When everything goes wrong, treat disaster as a way to wake up."་

## The Root Text

The original Lojong practice consists of 59 slogans, or aphorisms. These slogans are further organized into seven groupings, called the '7 Points of Lojong.' The categorized slogans are listed below, translated by the Nalanda Translation Committee under the direction of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche. It is emphasized that the following is translated from ancient Sanskrit and Tibetan texts, and therefore may vary slightly from other translations. Some slogans may feel esoteric or difficult to comprehend. 

## Slogans 

### Slogans as translated by the Nalanda Translation Committee

#### Point One: The preliminaries, which are the basis for dharma practice

Slogan 1. First, train in the preliminaries; The four reminders or alternatively called the Four Thoughts:

1. Maintain an awareness of the preciousness of human life.
2. Be aware of the reality that life ends; death comes for everyone; Impermanence.
3. Recall that whatever you do, whether virtuous or not, has a result; Karma.
4. Contemplate that as long as you are too focused on self-importance and too caught up in thinking about how you are good or bad, you will experience suffering. Obsessing about getting what you want and avoiding what you don't want does not result in happiness; Ego.

#### Point Two: The main practice, which is training in bodhicitta.

**Absolute Bodhicitta**

Slogan 2. Regard all dharmas as dreams; although experiences may seem solid, they are passing memories.

Slogan 3. Examine the nature of unborn awareness.

Slogan 4. Self-liberate even the antidote.

Slogan 5. Rest in the nature of alaya, the essence, the present moment.

Slogan 6. In postmeditation, be a child of illusion.

**Relative Bodhicitta**

Slogan 7. Sending and taking should be practiced alternately. These two should ride the breath (aka. Practice Tonglen).

Slogan 8. Three objects, three poisons, three roots of virtue -- The 3 objects are friends, enemies and neutrals. The 3 poisons are craving, aversion and indifference. The 3 roots of virtue are the remedies.

Slogan 14. Seeing confusion as the four kayas is unsurpassable shunyata protection.

The kayas are Dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya, svabhavikakaya. Thoughts have no birthplace, thoughts are unceasing, thoughts are not solid, and these three characteristics are interconnected. Shunyata can be described as "complete openness."

Slogan 15. Four practices are the best of methods.

The four practices are: accumulating merit, laying down evil deeds, offering to the dons, and offering to the dharmapalas.

Slogan 16. Whatever you meet unexpectedly, join with meditation.

#### Point Four: Showing the Utilization of Practice in One's Whole Life

Slogan 17. Practice the five strengths, the condensed heart instructions.

The 5 strengths are: strong determination, familiarization, the positive seed, reproach, and aspiration.

Slogan 18. The mahayana instruction for ejection of consciousness at death is the five strengths: how you conduct yourself is important.

When you are dying practice the 5 strengths.

####Point Five: Evaluation of Mind Training

Slogan 19. All dharma agrees at one point -- All Buddhist teachings are about lessening the ego, lessening one's self-absorption.

Slogan 20. Of the two witnesses, hold the principal one -- You know yourself better than anyone else knows you

Slogan 21. Always maintain only a joyful mind.

Slogan 22. If you can practice even when distracted, you are well trained.

Slogan 24. Change your attitude, but remain natural.-- Reduce ego clinging, but be yourself.

Slogan 25. Don't talk about injured limbs -- Don't take pleasure contemplating others defects.

Slogan 26. Don't ponder others -- Don't take pleasure contemplating others weaknesses.

Slogan 27. Work with the greatest defilements first -- Work with your greatest obstacles first.

Slogan 28. Abandon any hope of fruition -- Don't get caught up in how you will be in the future, stay in the present moment.

Slogan 29. Abandon poisonous food.

Slogan 30. Don't be so predictable -- Don't hold grudges.

Slogan 31. Don't malign others.

Slogan 37. Don't turn gods into demons -- Don't use these slogans or your spirituality to increase your self-absorption

Slogan 38. Don't seek others' pain as the limbs of your own happiness.

#### Point Seven: Guidelines of Mind Training

Slogan 39. All activities should be done with one intention.

Slogan 40. Correct all wrongs with one intention.

Slogan 41. Two activities: one at the beginning, one at the end.

Slogan 42. Whichever of the two occurs, be patient.

Slogan 43. Observe these two, even at the risk of your life.

Slogan 44. Train in the three difficulties.

Slogan 45. Take on the three principal causes: the teacher, the dharma, the sangha.

Slogan 46. Pay heed that the three never wane: gratitude towards one's teacher, appreciation of the dharma (teachings) and correct conduct.

Slogan 47. Keep the three inseparable: body, speech, and mind.

Slogan 48. Train without bias in all areas. It is crucial always to do this pervasively and wholeheartedly.

Slogan 49. Always meditate on whatever provokes resentment.

Slogan 50. Don't be swayed by external circumstances.

Slogan 51. This time, practice the main points: others before self, dharma, and awakening compassion.

Slogan 52. Don't misinterpret.

The six things that may be misinterpreted are patience, yearning, excitement, compassion, priorities and joy. You're patient when you're getting your way, but not when its difficult. You yearn for worldly things, instead of an open heart and mind. You get excited about wealth and entertainment, instead of your potential for enlightenment. You have compassion for those you like, but none for those you don't. Worldly gain is your priority rather than cultivating loving-kindness and compassion. You feel joy when you enemies suffer, and do not rejoice in others' good fortune.

Slogan 53. Don't vacillate (in your practice of LoJong).

Slogan 54. Train wholeheartedly.

Slogan 55. Liberate yourself by examining and analyzing: Know your own mind with honesty and fearlessness.

Slogan 56. Don't wallow in self-pity.

Slogan 57. Don't be jealous.

Slogan 58. Don't be frivolous.

Slogan 59. Don't expect applause.
