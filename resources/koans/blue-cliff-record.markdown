# The Blue  Cliff Record 
 
From Wikipedia: 
 
> The Blue Cliff Record (Chinese: 《碧巖錄》 Bìyán Lù; Japanese: Hekiganroku (碧巌録?)) is a collection of Chán Buddhist koans originally compiled in China during the Song dynasty in 1125 (宋宣和七年) and then expanded into its present form by the Chán master Yuanwu Keqin (圜悟克勤 1063 – 1135). 
> The book includes Yuanwu's annotations and commentary on Xuedou Zhongxian's (雪竇重顯 980 – 1052) collection 100 Verses on Old Cases 《頌古百則》 — a compilation of 100 koans. Xuedou selected 82 of these from the Jingde Chuandeng Lu 《景德傳燈錄》 (Jingde era Record of the Transmission of the Lamp), with the remainder selected from the Yunmen Guanglu 《雲門廣録》 (Extensive Record of Yunmen Wenyan (864 – 949). 
> Yuanwu's successor, Dahui Zonggao (大慧宗杲 1089 – 1163). wrote many letters to lay students teaching the practice of concentrating on koans during meditation. But Dahui did not explain and analyze koans. Oral tradition holds that Dahui noticed students engaged in too much intellectual discourse on koans, and then burned the wooden blocks used to print the Bìyán Lù. 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 1: Bodhidharma's "Clear and Void" 
 
Emperor Bu of Ryo _1_ asked Great Master Bodhidharma, 
 
  "What is the highest meaning of the holy reality?" 
 
Bodhidharma replied, 
 
  "Clear and void, no holiness." 
 
The emperor said, 
 
  "Who are you in front of me?" 
 
Bodhidharma said, 
 
  "I don't know." 
 
The emperor did not match him. 
 
Finally, Bodhidharma crossed the Yangtse River and came to the kingdom of Gi. 
 
Later, the emperor asked Shiko for his view. Shiko said, 
 
  "Does Your Majesty know who this man is?" 
 
The emperor said, 
 
  "I don't know." 
 
Shiko said, 
 
  "He is the Mahasattwa Avalokitesvara transmitting the seal of Buddha's Mind." 
 
The emperor regretted and wanted to send an emissary to invite Bodhidharma 
 
back. Shiko said,  
 
  "Your Majesty, do not intend to send an emissary to fetch him back. Even if 
 
   all the people in the land were to go after him, he would not return." 
 
_1_ Emperor Bu reigned over the land of Ryo between 502-509 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 2: Joshu's "Supreme Way" 
 
Joshu, instructing the assembly, said,  
 
  "The supreme Way is not difficult; it simply dislikes choosing _1_. But even 
 
   if a word is uttered, it is already an action of 'choosing' or of adhering 
 
   to 'clarity'. This old monk _2_ doesn't dwell in clarity. Do you monks want 
 
   to keep a firm hold on 'clarity' or not?" 
 
At that time a monk asked, 
 
  "You say you do not dwell in clarity. If so, what is there to keep a firm 
 
   hold on?" 
 
Joshu said, 
 
  "I don't know, either." 
 
The monk said, 
 
  "If you, Master, don't know, why do you say that you don't dwell in clarity?" 
 
Joshu said, 
 
  "You have already asked amply. Bow and withdraw." 
 
_1_ Cf. the beginning of the Shinjinmei (Believing in the Mind; Poem composed 
 
     by the third Patriarch Sosan): 
 
        "The supremet Way is not difficult; 
 
         it simply dislikes choosing. 
 
         Only if there is no love or hatred, 
 
         all is complete clarity." 
 
            
 
_2_ "this old monk" i.e. "I" 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Cas 3: Master Ba Is Ill 
 
Great Master Ba was seriously ill. The chief priest of the temple asked him, 
 
  "Master, how are you feeling these days?" 
 
Great Master said, 
 
  "Sun-face Buddha, Moon-face Buddha" _1_. 
 
_1_ The "Sun-face Buddha" is a buddha, who is said to have a life of 
 
     1800 years, while the "Moon-face Buddha" lives only 24 hours. 
 
 
### Case 4: Tokusan with His Bundle 
 
Tokusan arrived at Isan. Carrying his bundle under his arm, he stepped into 
 
the Dharma hall. He walked across it from east to west and from west to east. 
 
Looking around he said, "None, none!" and went out. 
 
(Setcho _1_ commented: "Seen through!") 
 
But when he got to the entrance gate, Tokusan said, "Still, I shouldn't be so 
 
hasty." So, he dressed formally and entered again to meet Isan. As Isan sat at 
 
his place, Tokusan held up his sitting cloth in a ceremonial manner and said, 
 
"Master!" Isan was about to take his whisk, when suddenly Tokusan shouted, 
 
"Kaatz!" Then he flourished his sleeves and went out. 
 
(Setcho commented: "Seen through!") 
 
Turning his back on the Dharma hall, Tokusan put on his straw sandals and left. 
 
In the evening, Isan asked the head monk, "Where is the newcomer who was here 
 
a while ago?" The head monk said, "He soon turned his back on the Dharma hall, 
 
put on his straw sandals and went away." Isan said, "One day that fellow 
 
will build a grass hut upon a lonely peak, and scold the buddhas and abuse 
 
the patriarchs." 
 
(Setcho commented: "Piling up frost on top of snow.") 
 
_1_ Setcho Zenji is the compiler of the Hekiganroku. 
 
_2_ In Japanese: hossu i.e. a stick with a flexible whisk on top 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 5: Seppo's "Grain of Rice" 
 
Seppo, teaching the assembly, said, 
 
  "When you pick up the whole earth in your fingers, it's the size of a grain 
 
   of rice. I cast it down before you. Like in a black lacquer bucket, you 
 
   don't recognize it any more. Beat the drum, call everyone to look for it!" 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 6: Unmon's "Good Day" 
 
Unmon, giving instruction, said,

  "Every day is a good day."

Towards the end of summer _1_, Suigan instructed the assembly, saying, 
 
  "All summer I've preached to you, my brothers. Look here, are Suigan's 
 
   eyebrows still there? _2_" 
 
Hofuku said, 
 
  "The robber's heart is terrified!" 
 
Chokei said, 
 
  "They are well grown!" 
 
Unmon said, 
 
  "Kan!" _3_ 
 
_1_ Summer-sesshin for 3 months. 
 
_2_ According to the popular belief a great criminal should lose his eyebrows 
 
     as a sign of his coming punishment in hell. 
 
_3_ Literally kan means "barrier" (cf. Mumonkan). In those days this Chinese 
 
     word colloquially meant also, "Watch out!" or "There!" 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 9: Joshu's Four Gates 
 
A monk asked Joshu, 
 
  "What is Joshu?" _1_ 
 
Joshu said,

     which he taught. 
 
 
### Case 10: Bokushu's "Idiot" 
 
Bokushu asked a monk, "Where have you come from?" 
 
At once the monk shouted, "Kaatz!" 
 
Bokushu said, "The old monk has been scolded by you with a 'Kaatz'!" 
 
The monk shouted again, "Kaatz!" 
 
Bokushu said, "After three or four shouts of 'Kaatz', then what?" 
 
The monk was silent.  
 
Bokushu hit him saying, "You idiot!" 
 
 
### Case 11: Obaku's "Drinkers of Lees" 
 
Obaku, instructing the assembly, said, 
 
  "You are all drinkers of lees. If you continue to go on your Way like this, 
 
   where will the 'Today' _The world of nirvana_ be? Do you know that in 
 
   this great empire of Tang there is no Zen master?" 
 
Now a monk came forward and said, 
 
  "What would you say to the fact that in various places there are people who 
 
   accept students and direct their assemblies?" 
 
Obaku said, 
 
  "I don't say that there is no Zen; I only say that there is no master." 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 12: Tozan's "Three Pounds of hemp" _1_

Kyosei said, "You fool in the weeds!" 
 
 
### Case 17: Kyorin's "Sitting for a Long Time"

### Hekiganroku - Case 18: The National Teacher's Gravestone 
 
Emperor Shukuso _1_ asked Chu, the national teacher, 
 
  "What would you wish me to do after a hundred years ?" _2_ 
 
The national teacher said, 
 
  "Make a seamless gravestone _3_ for this old monk."  
 
The emperor said, 
 
  "I should like to ask you, master, for a design." 
 
The national teacher remained silent for a long time. Then he said, 
 
  "Did you understand?" 
 
The emperor said, 
 
  "I didn't understand anything." 
 
The national teacher said,  
 
  "I have a Dharma successor, my disciple Tangen, who is well versed with 
 
   this matter. Let him come to you and ask him about it." 
 
After the national teacher passed away, the emperor called Tangen and asked 
 
him about the meaning of this. Tangen responded: 
 
  "The south of the river, north of the lake: 
 
      (Setcho commented, "The single hand does not sound without reason.") 
 
  In between there's gold, which fills the whole land. 
 
      (Setcho commented, "A staff, hewn freshly from the mountain forest.") 
 
  Under the shadowless tree all people are in one boat; 
 
      (Setcho added, "The sea is peaceful, the river clear.") 
 
  In the crystal palace there is no one who knows. 
 
      (Setcho commented, "The speech is finished.")"

  "Bring me a chin rest." 
 
Ryuge brought one and gave it to him. Suibi took it and hit him.  
 
Ryuge said, 
 
  "You may hit me as you like. After all there is no meaning to the 
 
   Patriarch's coming from the west." 
 
Ryuge also asked Rinzai, 
 
  "What is the meaning of the Patriarch's coming from the west?" 
 
Rinzai said, 
 
  "Bring me a sitting cushion." 
 
Ryuge got one and gave it to Rinzai. Rinzai took it and hit him. Ryuge said,

   should look at it carefully!" 
 
Chokei said, 
 
  "Today in the Zen hall there are many people. They have lost their body 
 
   and life." 
 
A monk told this to Gensha, who said, 
 
  "Only Elder Brother Ryo _2_ could say something like that. However, 
 
   I wouldn't talk like that." 
 
The monk asked, 
 
  "What then would you say, Master"? 
 
Gensha replied, 
 
  "Why does it have to be 'the southern side of the mountain'?" 
 
Unmon threw his staff in front of Seppo and acted frightened.

  "Right here is the summit of Myo Peak." _1_ 
 
Chokei said, 
 
  "Exactly. But, it's regrettable."  
 
  (Setcho commented saying, 
 
     "What's the use of making an excursion with these fellows today?" 
 
   He again said, 
 
     "Hundreds and thousands of years from now, I don't say that there will 
 
      be none like him, only that there will be very few.") 
 
Later, they reported to Kyosei about it. Kyosei said,

The hermit of Lotus Peak _1_ took up his staff and showed it to the assembly, 
 
saying, "When the old ones _2_ reached this point, why didn't they dare 
 
to remain here?" The assembly was silent. He himself answered in their stead, 
 
saying, "Because that has no power on the Way." 
 
Again he said, "After all, how is it?" Once more he himself answered in 
 
their place, saying, "With my staff across my shoulders, and, paying other 
 
people no heed, I go straight into the thousand and ten thousand peaks."

Nansen said, 
 
   "There is." 
 
Hyakujo asked, 
 
   "What is this Dharma that has never been preached to the people?" 
 
Nansen said, 
 
   "This is not mind, this is not Buddha, this is not thing." 
 
Hyakujo said, 
 
   "You did preach like that." 
 
Nansen said, 
 
   "That's how it is with me. How about you, Master?" 
 
Hyakujo said, 
 
   "I am not a man of great wisdom. How am I to know whether there is a 
 
    Dharma that has been preached or that has never been preached?" 
 
Nansen said, 
 
   "I don't understand." 
 
Hyakujo said,

Mayoku then came to Nansen. He circled Nansen's dais three times, shook 
 
the ring-staff and stood there bolt upright. 
 
Nansen said, "Not right, not right!"  (Setcho comments, "Wrong!")  
 
Then, Mayoku said, "Master Shokei said, 'Right, right!' Why, Master, do you 
 
say, 'Not right, not right!'?" 
 
Nansen said, "With Shokei it is right, but with you it is not right.  
 
This is nothing but a whirling of the wind _1_. In the end, it will perish."

As he made a deep bow, Jo suddenly attained a great enlightenment. 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 33: Chinso Has One Eye 
 
National Secretary Chinso went to see Shifuku. When Shifuku saw him coming, he 
 
drew a circle. Chinso said,  
 
  "It is already straying from the essence that your student has come to you

Thereupon Shifuku closed the door of his room.  
 
   (Setcho said, "Chinso has but one eye.")

   "How is the Buddhist Dharma in the South maintained?" 
 
Mujaku said,  
 
   "The monks of this age of the corrupted Dharma are venerating the precepts 
 
   a little."  
 
Manjusri said, 
 
   "How many monks are over there?" 
 
Mujaku said,  
 
   "Three hundred here, five hundred there." 
 
Mujaku asked Manjusri,  
 
   "How is the Buddhist Dharma maintained here?"

The head monk said, 
 
  "Where did you go?" 
 
Chosa said, 
 
  "First, I went following the scented grass; then came back through the 
 
   falling flowers." 
 
The head monk said, 
 
  "It sounds very much like a spring mood." 
 
Chosa said, 
 
   "It's better than the autumn dew dropping on the lotus flower." 
 
(Setcho commented, "I am grateful for that answer.") 
 
 
### Case 37: Banzan's "Not One Thing in the Three Worlds"

### Hekiganroku - Case 38: Fuketsu's "Heart Seal" 
 
When he was staying at the government office of the Province Ei, Fuketsu 
 
entered the hall _to preach_ and said, 
 
  "The heart seal _1_ _stamp_ of the patriarch _2_ resembles the activity 
 
   of the iron ox _3_. When it goes away, the _impression of the_ seal 
 
   remains; when it stays there, the _impression of the_ seal is brought to 
 
   naught. If it neither goes away nor stays, would it be right to give a 
 
   seal _of approval_ or not?" 
 
Then Elder Rohi came up and said, 
 
  "I have the activities of the iron ox. _However,_ I ask you, Master, 
 
   not to give me the seal." 
 
Fuketsu said, 
 
  "I am accustomed to leveling the great ocean through fishing whales. But, 
 
   alas, now I find instead a frog wriggling about in the mud." 
 
Rohi stood there considering. 
 
Fuketsu shouted 
 
  "Kaatz!" 
 
and said, 
 
  "Why don't you say anything else, Elder?" 
 
Rohi was perplexed. 
 
Fuketsu hit him with his whisk and said, 
 
  "Do you remember what you said? Say something, I'll check it for you." 
 
Rohi tried to say something. Fuketsu hit him again with his whisk. 
 
The Magistrate said, 
 
  "Buddha's law and the King's law are of the same nature." 
 
Fuketsu said, 
 
  "What principle do you see in them?" 
 
The Magistrate said, 
 
  "If you do not make a decision where a decision should be made, 
 
   you are inviting disorder." 
 
Fuketsu descended from the rostrum. 
 
 
_1_ The form of the heart-mind. 
 
_2_ Bodhidharma. 
 
_3_ An "iron ox" is a massive construction which lay at the bottom of the

A monk asked Unmon, 
 
  "What is the Pure Dharma-body _1_?" 
 
Unmon said, 
 
  "Flower fence" _2_. 
 
The monk said, 
 
  "What if I understand the point that way?" 
 
Unmon said, 
 
  "A golden-haired lion."  
 
_1_ The body of the ultimate Truth (Jap. hoshin, sk. dharmakaya) or one of the 
 
     three bodies of Buddha. 
 
_2_ In Japanese: Kayakuran. It actually was a flower fence around a restroom. 
 
 
### Case 40: Nansen and the Flower 
 
Minister Rikuko talked with Nansen. 
 
Rikuko said, 
 
   "Dharma-teacher Jo said, 'Heaven and earth and I have one and the 
 
   same root; all things and I are one single body.' How wonderful this is!" 
 
Nansen pointed at the flowers in the garden, called to Rikuko and said, 
 
   "People of our time _1_ see these flowers as in a dream." 
 
 
_1_ I.e. "you." 
 
 
### Case 41: Joshu's "Great Death" 
 
Joshu asked Tosu, 
 
   "What is it if a man who has died a great Death comes back to life?" 
 
Tosu said, 
 
   "I don't allow walking about in the night. Come in the daylight." 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 42: Ho Koji's "Beautiful Snow" 
 
Ho Koji _1_ was leaving Yakusan. The latter ordered ten of his Zen students 
 
to see Koji off at the temple gate. Koji pointed to the falling snow in the 
 
air and said,  
 
  "Beautiful snow-flakes! -- they don't fall on any other place." 
 
At that time there was a student named Zen, who said, 
 
  "Where then do they fall?" 
 
Koji gave him a slap. Zen said,  
 
  "Koji, don't be so rough." 
 
Koji said,  
 
  "If you name yourself Zen student in such a condition, Old En _2_ will 
 
   never release you!" 
 
Zen said, 
 
  "What then would you say, Koji?" 
 
Koji slapped him again and said, 
 
  "You see with your eyes but you are just like a blind man. You speak with 
 
   your mouth, but you are just like a dumb man." 
 
(Setcho added his comment, "At the first words, I immediately would have 
 
 made a snowball and threw it against him.")  
 
 
_1_ Koji is an honorific for a lay practitioner of Buddhism. 
 
_2_ Usually named Emma-Daio (the King of hell Emma). He is supposed to be the 
 
     fearful judge at the entrance of the realm of the dead. 
 
 
### Case 43: Tozan's "Cold and Heat" 
 
A monk asked Tozan,  
 
   "When cold and heat come, how should one avoid them?" 
 
Tozan said, 
 
   "Why not go to a place where there is neither cold nor heat?" 
 
The monk said, 
 
   "What kind of place is it where there is neither cold nor heat?" 
 
Tozan said, 
 
   "When it is cold, the cold kills you; when it is hot, the heat kills you."  
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 44: Kasan's "Beat the Drum" 
 
Kasan, giving instruction, said, 
 
  "Practicing and learning -- it is called 'hearing' (mon); 
 
   completing learning -- it is called 'being next _to the fact_' (rin). 
 
   When you have passed through these two, it is called 'true passing' 
 
   (shinka). " 
 
A monk stepped forward and asked, 
 
  "What is the 'true passing'?" 
 
Kasan said, 
 
  "Beat the drum." 
 
He asked again, 
 
  "What is the true Reality?" 
 
Kasan said, 
 
  "Beat the drum."  
 
He asked again, 
 
  "I do not ask about the sentence, 'Mind itself is Buddha.'_1_ 
 
   _But_ What does 'Neither Mind nor Buddha'_2_ mean?" 
 
Kasan said, 
 
  "Beat the drum." 
 
He asked once more, 
 
  "When someone who knows the ultimate Truth comes, how should we receive him?" 
 
Kasan said, 
 
  "Beat the drum!" 
 
_1_ Cf. Case 30 in the Mumonkan. 
 
_2_ Cf. Case 33 in the Mumonkan. 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 45: Joshu's "Cloth Robe" 
 
A monk asked Joshu, 
 
  "The ten thousand Dharmas _1_ come down to one. 
 
   What does the one come down to?" 
 
Joshu said, 
 
  "When I was living in the Province of Sei, I made a cloth robe. 
 
   It weighed seven pounds." 
 
_1_ The word "Dharma" means here "phenomenon". "Ten thousand Dharmas" means, 
 
     therefore, "all things that exist in the world of phenomena". 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 46: Kyosei and the Raindrops 
 
Kyosei asked a monk, 
 
  "What is that sound outside?" 
 
The monk said, 
 
  "That is the sound of raindrops."  
 
Kyosei said,  
 
  "People live in a topsy-turvy world. They lose themselves in delusion about 
 
   themselves and only pursue _outside_ objects." 
 
The monk said, 
 
  "What about you, Master?" 
 
Kyosei said, 
 
  "I was on the brink of losing myself in such delusions about myself." 
 
The monk said, 
 
  "What do you mean, 'on the brink of losing myself in such delusions 
 
   about myself'?" 
 
Kyosei said, 
 
  "To break through _into the world of Essence_ may be easy. But to express 
 
   fully the bare substance is difficult." 
 
 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 47: Unmon's "Six" 
 
A monk asked Unmon, 
 
  "What is the Dharma-body _1_?" 
 
Unmon said, 
 
  "The six _2_ can't grasp it." 
 
_1_ (same note as Case 39) The body of the ultimate Truth (Jap. hoshin, sk. 
 
     dharmakaya) or one of the three bodies of Buddha. 
 
_2_ The "Six" means "six roots" (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, consciousness), 
 
     "six objects" (color, voice, odor, taste, touch, phenomenon), and/or 
 
     "six functions" (see, hear, smell, taste, feel, know). Or it could be 
 
     any other "six"-ness. 
 
 
### CASE 48: Tea at Shokei Temple 
 
Minister Ô _1_ visited Shokei Temple, where he offered tea. The senior monk 
 
Ro took up the kettle to serve Myosho _2_. But Ro overturned the kettle 
 
_over the tea hearth_. The minister saw this and asked the senior monk,  
 
   "What is there under the tea hearth?" 
 
Ro said, 
 
   "Deities holding up the hearth _3_." 
 
The minister said,  
 
   "If they are deities holding up the hearth, why did they overturn the 
 
    kettle?" 
 
Ro said, 
 
   "Thousand days of good service -- all is lost in one morning." 
 
The minister flourished his sleeves and went out. 
 
Myosho said, 
 
   "Elder Ro, you have eaten plenty of rice in Shokei Temple, and yet 
 
    you are simply a _useless_ stump in the field." 
 
Ro said, 
 
   "What would you have said, Master?" 
 
Myosho said, 
 
   "These non-human beings _4_ wreaked havoc." 
 
(Setcho said, "At that moment I would have kicked over the tea hearth.") 
 
 
_1_ Minister Ô was a patron of Shokei Temple. 
 
_2_ Myosho was senior to Ro. He was the abbot of the neighboring temple 
 
     and was apparently invited to the tea too. 
 
_3_ The legs of the tea hearth were shaped like demi-gods. 
 
_4_ I.e., the "deities who hold up the hearth". 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 49: Sansho's "Net" 
 
Sansho asked Seppo, 
 
   "When a fish with golden scales has passed through the net, what should 
 
    it get for food?" 
 
Seppo said,  
 
   "I will tell you when you have passed through the net." 
 
Sansho said, 
 
   "A great Zen master with 1500 disciples doesn't know how to speak." 
 
Seppo said, 
 
   "The old monk_1_ is just too busy with temple affairs." 
 
_1_ I.e., "I" 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 50: Unmon and the "Dust-Dust Samadhi" 
 
A monk asked Unmon,  
 
  "What is the dust-dust samadhi _1_ ?" 
 
Unmon said, 
 
  "Rice in the bowl, water in the pail."  
 
_1_ The word "dust" comes from the expression "six dust particles", which 
 
     means the same thing as the "six objects" (cf. note to Case 47). 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 51: Seppo's "What Is This?" 
 
When Seppo was living in a hermitage, two monks came to pay their respects. 
 
When he saw them coming, Seppo thrust open the gate of his hermitage with his 
 
hands, jumped out, and said,  
 
  "What is this?" 
 
The monks also said, 
 
  "What is this?" 
 
Seppo hung his head and retired into his hermitage. 
 
Later, the monks came to Ganto. He asked them,  
 
  "Where have you come from?" 
 
The monks said, 
 
  "From Reinan _1_." 
 
Ganto said, 
 
  "Did you ever visit Seppo?" 
 
The monks said, 
 
  "Yes, we visited him." 
 
Ganto said, 
 
  "What did he say?" 
 
The monks related what had happened. Ganto said, 
 
  "What else did he say?" 
 
The monks said, 
 
  "Not a word; he hung his head and retired into his hermitage." 
 
Ganto said, 
 
  "Ah, how I regret now that in those days I did not tell him the last word! 
 
   If I had told it to him, no one under heaven could do anything against him." 
 
At the end of the summer practice period the monks came back to this 
 
conversation and asked him about its meaning. Ganto said, 
 
  "Why didn't you ask me about it sooner?" 
 
The monk said, 
 
  "We could not dare to ask you about it." 
 
Ganto said, 
 
  "Seppo was born on the same stem as I _2_, but he will not die on the same 
 
   stem. If you want to know the last word, it is just this." 
 
_1_ A region in the south, where Seppo was living at that time. 
 
_2_ Seppo and Ganto were both students of Tokusan; cf. Case 13 in the Mumonkan. 
 
 
### Case 52: Joshu's Stone Bridge 
 
A monk asked Joshu,  
 
   "For a long time, the stone bridge of Joshu _1_ has echoed in my ears. 
 
    But now that I've come here, I just see a log bridge." 
 
Joshu said, 
 
   "You simply see a log bridge; you don't see the stone bridge yet." 
 
The monk said, 
 
   "What is the stone bridge?" 
 
Joshu said, 
 
   "It lets donkeys cross, it lets horses cross." 
 
_1_ (same note as case 9) The name of the Zen Master Joshu is taken from the 
 
     city "Joshu", near which he taught. 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 53: Hyakujo and the Wild Ducks 
 
When Great Master Ba was walking with Hyakujo, he saw wild ducks flying by. 
 
The Great Master said,  
 
  "What is that?" 
 
Hyakujo said, 
 
  "Wild ducks." 
 
The Great Master said,  
 
  "Where did it go?" 
 
Hyakujo said, 
 
  "They flew away." 
 
The Great Master twisted Hyakujo's nose tip. Hyakujo cried out in pain. 
 
The Great Master said, 
 
  "Why flew away?" 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 54: Unmon Stretches His Arms 
 
Unmon asked a monk, 
 
  "Where have you come from?" 
 
The monk said, 
 
  "From Saizen." 
 
Unmon said, 
 
  "What words does Saizen say lately?" 
 
The monk stretched out his arms. Unmon slapped him. 
 
The monk said, 
 
  "I have something to say about it." 
 
Unmon then stretched out his own arms. The monk remained silent. 
 
Then Unmon hit him. 
 
 
### Case 55: Dogo's Condolence Visit 
 
Dogo and Zengen came to a house to express condolences. Zengen tapped on the 
 
coffin and said, 
 
   "Is this life or death?"  
 
Dogo said, 
 
   "I don't say life, I don't say death." 
 
Zengen said,  
 
   "Why don't you?" 
 
Dogo said, 
 
   "I won't say, I won't say." 
 
On the way back Zengen said, 
 
   "Master, please say it to me right away. If you don't, I shall hit you." 
 
Dogo said, 
 
   "If you want to hit me, you can hit me. But I will never say." 
 
Thereupon Zengen hit him. 
 
Some time later Dogo passed away. Zengen went to Sekiso and told him what 
 
had happened. Sekiso said, 
 
   "I don't say life, I don't say death." 
 
Zengen said, 
 
   "Why don't you?" 
 
Sekiso said, 
 
   "I won't say, I won't say." 
 
With these words, Zengen came suddenly to an insight. 
 
One day, Zengen took a hoe and walked in the Dharma-hall from east to west and 
 
west to east. Sekiso said,  
 
   "What are you doing?" 
 
Zengen said, 
 
   "I am seeking the sacred bones of the late master." 
 
Sekiso said, 
 
   "Giant billows far and wide; whitecaps swelling up to heaven. What 
 
    sort of sacred bones of your late master are you searching for?" 
 
   (Setcho commented, "Heavens! heavens!") 
 
Zengen said,  
 
   "That was very good for me in order to gain power." 
 
Taigen Fu _1_ said, 
 
   "The sacred bones of the late master are still there." 
 
_1_ He stood in the Dharma line of Seppo. 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 56: Kinzan and the "Arrow" 
 
A Zen devotee named Ryo asked Kinzan,  
 
  "What is it when one single arrow breaks through three barriers?" 
 
Kinzan said, 
 
  "Drive out the master from behind the barriers, so that I may see him." 
 
Ryo said, 
 
  "If so, I will acknowledge my failure and correct it." 
 
Kinzan said, 
 
  "Till when do you want to wait?" 
 
Ryo said, 
 
  "I made a nice shot, but no one could see the arrow," 
 
and he went out. Kinzan said, 
 
  "Wait, sir." 
 
Ryo turned his head. Kinzan grasped him and said, 
 
  "Let's put aside the story of the arrow which breaks through three barriers. 
 
   Just shoot an arrow for me, so that I may see it." 
 
Ryo hesitated. Kinzan hit him seven times with a stick and said, 
 
  "I will allow this fellow to keep puzzling for thirty years." 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 57: Joshu and the "Bumpkin" 
 
A monk asked Joshu, 
 
  "'The supreme Way is not difficult; it simply dislikes choosing'. What 
 
   is non-choosing?" 
 
Joshu said, 
 
  "Above the heavens and under the heavens I am the only one, alone and 
 
   exalted." 
 
The monk said, 
 
  "That is still choosing." 
 
Joshu said, 
 
  "You stupid bumpkin, where is the choosing?" 
 
The monk remained silent. 
 
 
### Case 58: Joshu and the "Pitfall" 
 
A monk asked Joshu,  
 
   "'The supreme Way is not difficult; it simply dislikes choosing.' Isn't 
 
   that the pitfall of the people of our time _1_?"  
 
Joshu said, 
 
   "Once someone asked me like that. I am sorry that even after five years 
 
   I still can't give an answer to it." 
 
_1_ (same note as Case 40) I.e. "you." 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 59: Joshu's "Supreme Way" 
 
A monk asked Joshu, 
 
  "'The supreme way is not difficult, it simply dislikes choosing. But even 
 
   if a word is uttered, it is already an action of 'choosing.' -- Then how 
 
   can you, Master, try to lead other people?" 
 
Joshu said, 
 
  "Why don't you quote the sentence to the end?" 
 
The monk said,  
 
  "I just had this much in my mind." 
 
Joshu said, 
 
  "It's only: 'The supreme way is not difficult; it simply dislikes 
 
   choosing.'" _1_ 
 
_1_ Cf. Case 2. 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 60: Unmon's Staff

### Hekiganroku - Case 61: Fuketsu's "House and Nation" 
 
Fuketsu, giving instruction, said,

   "Is there anyone who lives and dies with this?") 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 62: Unmon's "One Treasure" 
 
Unmon, instructing the assembly, said,  
 
  "'Within heaven and earth, in the midst of the universe, there is one 
 
   treasure hidden in a body.' _1_ You take up the lantern and go to the 
 
   Buddha Hall; you take the temple gate and put it on the lantern." 
 
_1_ A sentence from the Hozoron by Monk Jo (?-414). 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 63: Nansen Kills a Cat _1_ 
 
Once the monks of the eastern and western Zen halls in Nansen's temple were 
 
quarrelling about a cat. As he saw this, Nansen held up the cat and said,

No one could answer. Nansen cut the cat in two. 
 
_1_ Cf. Case 14 in the Mumonkan.

  "The great benevolence and great mercy of the World-Honored One have opened 
 
   the clouds of my delusion and enabled me to enter the Way." 
 
After the non-Buddhist took his leave, Ananda asked Buddha, 
 
  "What did the non-Buddhist realize so that he said you had enabled him 
 
   to enter the Way?" 
 
Buddha said,

At each meal, Master Kingyu himself would bring the rice bucket to the front 
 
of the Zen hall, dance there and laugh loudly, saying, 
 
  "Dear Bodhisattvas, come and eat rice!" 
 
 (Setcho said, "Although he behaved that way, he was not being kind.") 
 
A monk asked Chokei, 
 
  "An ancient worthy said, 'Dear Bodhisattvas, come and eat rice.' What 
 
   does it mean?" 
 
Chokei said, 
 
  "That is exactly like praising and giving thanks to the rice." 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 75: Ukyu's Blind Stick 
 
A monk came from Master Joshu _1_ to Ukyu. Ukyu asked, 
 
  "What is the difference between Joshu's Dharma-way and the Dharma-way here?" 
 
 The monk said, 
 
  "There is no difference." 
 
Ukyu said, 
 
  "If there isn't any difference, return to him again," 
 
and hit him. The monk said, 
 
  "Your stick should have an eye. You should not hit a person so recklessly." 
 
Ukyu said, 
 
  "Today I hit a right man," 
 
and he hit him three more times. The monk went out immediately. Ukyu said, 
 
  "There is a fellow who well deserves a blind stick." 
 
The monk turned and said, 
 
  "What shall I do, as the stick is in your hand?" 
 
Ukyu said, 
 
  "If you need it, I will give it to you." 
 
The monk approached him, snatched the stick from his hand and hit him three 
 
times. Ukyu said, 
 
  "Blind stick, blind stick!" 
 
The monk said, 
 
  "There is a fellow who well deserves it." 
 
Ukyu said, 
 
  "I have hit a real man quite wantonly." 
 
Then the monk promptly made a bow. Ukyu said, 
 
  "Master, is that all right for you?" 
 
The monk laughed loudly and went away. Ukyu said, 
 
  "Is that right, is that right!" 
 
_1_ This is not the famous master Joshu Jushin in the Mumonkan, etc., but 
 
     Master Joshu Sekizo (718-800). 
 
 
### Case 76: Tanka's "Eating Rice" 
 
Tanka asked a monk, 
 
   "Where have you come from?" 
 
The monk answered, 
 
   "From the foot of the mountain." 
 
Tanka asked, 
 
   "Have you eaten your rice?" 
 
The monk said, 
 
   "Yes I have eaten it."  
 
Tanka said, 
 
   "The one who brought rice and gave it to you to eat did he have an 
 
    _enlightened_ eye?" 
 
The monk said nothing. 
 
Chokei asked Hofuku, 
 
   "Surely it is an act of thanksgiving _1_ to bring rice and give it to the 
 
    people to eat. How then is it possible not to have an _enlightened_ eye?" 
 
Hofuku said,  
 
   "Server and receiver are both blind." 
 
Chokei said, 
 
   "Even if one has done everything, does one still remain blind, or not?" 
 
Hofuku said, 
 
   "Do you call me blind?" 
 
_1_ That is, for the guidance already received from buddhas, patriarchs and 
 
     masters. 
 
 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 77: Unmon's "Rice Cake" 
 
A monk asked Unmon, 
 
  "What is meant by the pronouncement 'to go beyond the Buddha and the 
 
   patriarchs'?" 
 
Unmon said, 
 
  "Rice cake _1_." 
 
_1_ In Japanese: kobyo. 
 
 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 78: The Boddhisattvas Take a Bath 
 
In the old days there were sixteen bodhisattvas. When the monks took a bath, 
 
they too entered the bath according to their custom. At once they realized 
 
the cause of water. Now, my Zen friends, how do you understand this? _1_ 
 
The bodhisattvas said, "Wonderful feeling! Perfectly clear! We have attained 
 
the dwelling place of the children of Buddha." You can attain it -- only by 
 
breaking through seven times and digging through eight times. 
 
_1_ It is Setcho who speaks here. 
 
 
### Case 79: Tosu and "the Buddha's Voices" 
 
A monk asked Tosu, 
 
   "It is said, 'All voices are the voices of the Buddha.' Is it true or not?" 
 
Tosu said, 
 
   "It is true." 
 
The monk said, 
 
   "Master, don't fart around so loudly." 
 
Thereupon, Tosu hit him. He asked again, 
 
   "It is said, 'Rough words and gentle phrases return to the first principle.'  
 
    Is this true or not?" 
 
Tosu said, 
 
   "It is true." 
 
The monk said, 
 
   "May I call you, Master, a donkey?" 
 
Thereupon, Tosu hit him. 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 80: Joshu and a "Newborn Infant" 
 
A monk asked Joshu, 
 
  "Does a newborn infant have the Six Functions _1_ or not?" 
 
Joshu said, 
 
  "Throwing a ball on the swift current." 
 
The monk asked also Tosu, 
 
  "What does 'throwing a ball on the swift current' mean?" 
 
Tosu said, 
 
  "Every consciousness flows without ceasing."  
 
_1_ Cf. the note to case 47. 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 81: Yakusan's "Look! The Arrow!" 
 
A monk asked Yakusan,  
 
  "On the grassy plain there gather great and small deer. How can one shoot 
 
   the greatest deer of them all?" 
 
Yakusan said, 
 
  "Look! The arrow!"  
 
The monk threw himself on the floor. Yakusan said, 
 
  "Attendants! Carry this dead fellow out of here." 
 
Thereupon, the monk ran away. Yakusan said, 
 
  "This fellow will keep playing with mud balls for ever and ever!" 
 
 (Setcho took up this story and said, 
 
     "He is alive for three steps, but he should die with the fifth step.") 
 
 
### Case 82: Dairyu and the "Dharma-Body" 
 
A monk asked Dairyu,  
 
   "The phenomenal body perishes. What is the Dharma-body which remains solid?" 
 
Dairyu said, 
 
   "The autumn foliage of the mountains spreads like brocade; 
 
    the water in the valley remains blue as indigo." 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 83: The Old Buddha and a Pillar 
 
Unmon, instructing the assembly, said, 
 
  "The old buddha and a pillar intersect each other. What number of 
 
   activity is that?" 
 
On behalf of the assembly he said, 
 
  "Clouds gather over the South Mountain; rain falls on the North Mountain." 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 84: Vimalakirti and "Not-Two" 
 
Vimalakirti asked Manjusri, 
 
  "What does it mean that the Bodhisattva enters the Dharma-gate of Not-Two?" 
 
Manjusri said, 
 
  "I see it like this: in all phenomena, there are neither words nor 
 
   explanations, neither presentations nor knowledge; it is beyond all 
 
   questions and answers. That is what I understand with 'to enter the 
 
   Dharma-gate of Not-Two'." .... 
 
Then Manjusri asked Vimalakirti, 
 
  "All of us have finished giving our explanations. Now you should give your 
 
   explanation. What does it mean that the Bodhisattva enters the  
 
   Dharma-gate of Not-Two?" 
 
 (Setcho said, "What did Vimalakirti say?" Again he said, "Seen through!") 
 
 
### Case 85: Toho and the "Tiger" 
 
A monk came to the hermit Toho and asked, 
 
   "What if you suddenly faced a tiger here?" 
 
The hermit roared like a tiger. Thereupon the monk pretended to be frightened. 
 
The hermit laughed loudly. The monk said, 
 
   "You old robber!" 
 
The hermit said, 
 
   "What can you do to me?"  
 
The monk said nothing further. 
 
 (Setcho said, 
 
     "They are certainly right, but these two evil robbers only know how to 
 
      steal a small bell while they stop their ears.") 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 86: Unmon's "Bright Light" 
 
Unmon, giving instruction, said,  
 
  "Everyone has his own bright light. When you look at it, you can't see it; 
 
   it is complete darkness. Now, what is your bright light?" 
 
He himself answered on behalf of the monks,  
 
  "The kitchen and the entrance gate." 
 
Again he said, 
 
  "It would be better not to have even the best things." 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 87: Unmon's "Medicine and Disease" 
 
Unmon, instructing the assembly, said,  
 
  "Medicine and disease correspond to each other. The whole earth is 
 
   medicine. What is your true self?" 
 
 
### Case 88: Gensha's "Three Diseases" 
 
Gensha, instructing the assembly, said, 
 
   "All old masters said, 'Attend to the living beings and save them.' 
 
    Suppose you face three people with different diseases, how would you 
 
    attend to them? The blind person can't see, even if you take up a gavel 
 
    or raise a whisk. The deaf person can't hear, even if you speak beautiful 
 
    phrases. The dumb person can't speak, even if you ask him to speak up. 
 
    How would you attend to them?  If you cannot attend to these people, 
 
    Buddhist Dharma has no true efficacy." 
 
A monk asked Unmon about this. Unmon said, "Make a deep bow." The monk made a 
 
deep bow and stood up. Unmon poked his staff at him. The monk retreated. 
 
Unmon said, "So you are not blind." Further he said, "Come here." The monk 
 
came closer to him. Unmon said, "So you are not deaf." Then he said, 
 
   "Have you understood?" 
 
The monk said, 
 
   "No." 
 
Unmon said, 
 
   "So you are not dumb." 
 
With that, the monk came to an insight. 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 89: Ungan's "Hands and Eyes" 
 
Ungan asked Dogo,  
 
  "What does the Bodhisattva of the Great Mercy use so many hands and eyes for?" 
 
Dogo answered, 
 
  "It is like a person in the middle of the night reaching with his hand behind 
 
   his head groping for his pillow." 
 
Ungan said, 
 
  "I understood." 
 
Dogo said, 
 
  "How did you understand it?" 
 
Ungan said, 
 
  "The whole body is hands and eyes."  
 
Dogo said, 
 
  "You said it very well. But you expressed only eight-tenths of it." 
 
Ungan said, 
 
  "How would you say it, Elder Brother?" 
 
Dogo said, 
 
  "The entire body is hands and eyes." 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 90: Chimon and the "Prajna Wisdom" 
 
A monk asked Chimon, 
 
  "What is the substance of Prajna Wisdom?" 
 
Chimon said,  
 
  "The clam swallows the bright moon." _1_ 
 
The monk asked, 
 
  "What is the use of Prajna Wisdom?" 
 
Chimon said, 
 
  "A female rabbit becomes pregnant." _2_ 
 
_1_ A Chinese metaphor expressing how a pearl is formed. 
 
_2_ According to a Chinese legend, a female rabbit becomes pregnant when it 
 
     swallows the light of the full moon. 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 91: Enkan and the "Rhinoceros" 
 
One day, Enkan called to his attendant,  
 
   "Bring me the rhinoceros fan." 
 
The attendant said, 
 
   "It is broken." 
 
Enkan said, 
 
   "If the fan is already broken, bring me the rhinoceros himself." 
 
The attendant gave no answer. _1_ 
 
Tosu said, 
 
   "I wouldn't mind bringing that, but the horn on its head would not be 
 
    complete." 
 
   (Setcho said, "I need to see that incomplete horn.") 
 
Sekiso said, 
 
   "If I brought it back to you, nothing would remain _for me_." 
 
   (Setcho said, "That rhinoceros is still there.") 
 
Shifuku drew a circle and wrote the ideograph "ox_2_" in it. 
 
   (Setcho said, "Why didn't you bring it out sooner?) 
 
Hofuku said, 
 
   "Master, you are so advanced in years. Please engage someone else." _3_ 
 
   (Setcho said, "Regrettable! All efforts have proved fruitless!") 
 
_1_ To this episode the following Zen personalities give their answers on 
 
     behalf of the attendant. 
 
_2_ The Chinese character for "ox" (gyu) is one of the two characters for 
 
     "rhinoceros" (saigyu = sai + gyu). 
 
_3_ _Since the task you give me is too harsh._ 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 92: The Buddha Ascends to the Rostrum 
 
One day, the World-Honored One ascended to the rostrum. Monjusri struck the 
 
table with the gavel and said, 
 
  "Contemplate clearly the Dharma of the Dharma-King! The Dharma of  
 
   the Dharma-King is like this." 
 
Thereupon, the World-Honored One descended from the rostrum. 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 93: Taiko Dances 
 
A monk asked Taiko, 
 
  "Chokei said, 'That is exactly like thanksgiving at lunch.' _1_ 
 
   What did he mean?" 
 
Taiko danced. The monk made a deep bow.  Taiko said, 
 
  "What have you seen that makes you bow like that?" 
 
The monk danced. Taiko said, 
 
  "You stupid fox! _2_" 
 
_1_ cf case 74. 
 
_2_ Cf. the term "fox Zen", which means mere imitation (cf. Case 2 in the 
 
     Mumonkan) 
 
 
### Case 94: "Non-Seeing" in the Ryogon Sutra 
 
The Ryogon Sutra says,  
 
  "When I don't see, why do you not see what I do not see? If you _argue 
 
   that you_ see what I do not see, that is of course not what I do not see. 
 
   If you do not see what I do not see, then it is quite natural that it 
 
   is not a thing. Why is it not your self?"  
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 95: Chokei's "Three Poisons" 
 
One day Chokei said,  
 
  "Even if you argue that an arhat _1_ still possesses 'the three poisons', 
 
   don't argue that the Tathagata has two sorts of language. I do not say 
 
   the Tathagata has no words. I only say he does not have two kinds 
 
   of language." 
 
Hofuku said, 
 
  "What are the words of the Tathagata?" 
 
Chokei said, 
 
  "How can a deaf man hear?" 
 
Hofuku said, 
 
  "Now I know that your language belongs to the second level." 
 
Chokei said, 
 
  "What are the words of the Tathagata?" 
 
Hofuku said,  
 
  "Have some tea."  
 
_1_ An arhat is a sacred person who has reached the spiritual dimension 
 
     without any traces of "the three poisons": covetousness, anger, folly. 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 96: Joshu's Three Turning Words _1_ 
 
Joshu showed the assembly three turning words:  
 
  "The Buddha made of clay will not pass through water." 
 
  "The Buddha made of metal will not pass through a furnace." 
 
  "The Buddha made of wood will not pass through fire." 
 
_1_ Cf. case 19 in the Miscellaneous Koans. 
 
 
### Case 97: "Getting Despised" in the Diamond Sutra 
 
The Diamond Sutra says, 
 
  "It is about getting despised by other people. If you are to come into hell 
 
   because of your sins in your previous life, these sins will be extinguished 
 
   because you are despised by the people of this world." 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 98: Tempyo's Two "Wrong"s 
 
Master Tempyo was on an angya _1_ and visited Sai'in. (He was always saying, 
 
"Don't say you have understood Buddhism. I have sought after someone who 
 
could give correct explanations, but in vain.") 
 
One day, Sai'in saw him at a distance and summoned him, 
 
  "Jyui! _2_" 
 
Tempyo raised his head. Sai'in said, 
 
  "Wrong!" 
 
Tempyo went on a couple more steps. Sai'in said again, 
 
  "Wrong!"  
 
Tempyo came closer. Sai'in said, 
 
  "I have just said, 'Wrong!' twice. Does it mean that it is I 
 
   who am wrong, or it is you?" 
 
Tempyo said,  
 
  "It is I." 
 
Sai'in said, 
 
  "Wrong!" 
 
Tempyo said nothing. Sai'in said, 
 
  "Please stay here for the summer _3_. I'll examine the two 'Wrong!'s with 
 
   you." 
 
However, Tempyo immediately left him. 
 
Later he was the abbot of his own temple and said to his assembly, 
 
  "As I was once on an angya, I was driven by the wind of fate and came to 
 
   Elder Shimyo _4_, who cried to me, 'Wrong!'. Moreover, he demanded that 
 
   I stay with him for the summer to examine this matter with him. I didn't 
 
   believe I had done anything wrong then. But when I was on my way down 
 
   south, I realized quickly that I had done something entirely 'wrong'." 
 
_1_ A traditional pilgrimage in order to deepen the practice. 
 
_2_ Tempyo's personal name. 
 
_3_ I.e., a summer sesshin for three months. 
 
_4_ I.e., Sai'in. 
 
 
### Hekiganroku - Case 99: Shukuso and the "Buddha with the Ten Bodies" 
 
Emperor Shukuso asked the National Teacher Echu,  
 
  "What is the Buddha with the ten bodies who guides the living beings?" 
 
The National Teacher said, 
 
  "Sir! Go beyond the head of Vairokana _1_."  
 
The emperor said, 
 
  "I don't understand it."  
 
The National Teacher said,  
 
  "Never consider yourself to be even the pure Dharma-body." 
 
_1_ The Buddha of the pure Dharma-body. 
 
 
### Case 100: Haryo and the "Sharpest Sword" _1_

Haryo said, 
 
   "The moon sits on each branch of the coral."  
 
_1_ Cf. case 22 (c) in the Miscellaneous Koans.
