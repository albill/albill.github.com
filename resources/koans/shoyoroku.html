<strong><big><a name="01"></a>Case 1: The World-Honored One </big></strong><big></big>[1]<strong><big> Ascends to the Rostrum </big></strong><big></big>[2]

One day, the World-Honored One ascended to the rostrum. Manjusri struck the
table with the gavel and said,
  "Contemplate clearly the Dharma of the Dharma-King! The Dharma of
   the Dharma-King is like this."
Thereupon, the World-Honored One descended from the rostrum.

[1]: i.e. the Buddha.
[2]: see case 92 of Hekiganroku.

<strong><big><a name="02"></a>Case 2: Bodhidharma's "Vast and Void" </big></strong><big></big>[1]

Emperor Bu of Ryo asked Great Master Bodhidharma,
  "What is the highest meaning of the holy reality?"
Bodhidharma replied,
  "Vast and void, no holiness."
The emperor said,
  "Who are you in front of me?"
Bodhidharma said,
  "I don't know."
The emperor did not match him.

Finally, Bodhidharma crossed the Yangtse River and came to the Shorin Temple.
There he sat for nine years, facing the wall.

[1]: see case 1 of Hekiganroku.

<strong><big><a name="03"></a>Case 3: The Indian King Invites the Patriarch</big></strong><big></big>

A king of Eastern India invited the twenty-seventh patriarch, Prajna Tara,
for a meal. The king asked,
  "Why don't you recite sutras?"
The patriarch said,
  "The poor way [1] does not stay in the world of subject when breathing in,
   and has nothing to do with the world of objects when breathing out. I am
   always reciting the suchness-sutra in millions and millions of volumes."

[1]: i.e., "I."

<strong><big><a name="04"></a>Case 4: The World-Honored One Points to the Ground</big></strong><big></big>

When the World-Honored One was walking with his assembly, he pointed to the
ground with his hand and said,
  "This place is good for building a temple."
Indra [1] took a stalk of grass and stuck it in the ground and said,
  "The temple has been built."
The World-Honored One smiled.

[1]: Exactly: Sakra Devendra. The lord god of the Trayastrimasa Heaven.

<strong><big><a name="05"></a>Case 5: Seigen's "Price of Rice"</big></strong><big></big>

A monk asked Seigen,
  "What is the essence of Buddhism?"
Seigen said,
  "What is the price of rice in Roryo?" 

<strong><big><a name="06"></a>Case 6: Master Ba's "White and Black" [1]</big></strong><big></big>

A monk asked Great Master Ba,
   "Apart from the Four Phrases, beyond one hundred Negations, please
    tell me directly, Master, the meaning of Bodhidharma's coming from
    the West."
Master Ba said,
   "I am tired today, I can't explain it to you. Go and ask Chizo."
The monk asked Chizo about it. Chizo said,
   "Why don't you ask our master?"
The monk said,
   "He told me to ask you."
Chizo said,
   "I have a headache today, I can't explain it to you. Go and ask Brother Kai."
The monk asked Brother Kai about it. Kai said,
   "I don't understand nothing about that question."
The monk told Great Master Ba about it. Great Master said,
   "Chizo's head is white, Kai's head is black."

[1]: see case 73 of Hekiganroku.

<strong><big><a name="07"></a>

Case 7: Yakusan Ascends the Rostrum</big></strong><big></big>

Yakusan had not ascended the rostrum for a long time. The temple steward said,
  "All the assembly has been wishing for instruction for a long time. Please,
   Master, give your assembly a sermon."
Yakusan had the bell rung. The assembly gathered. Yakusan ascended the rostrum
and sat there for a while. Then he descended and returned to his room. The
temple steward followed him and asked,
  "You said a while ago that you would give the assembly a sermon. Why
   didn't you speak even a word?"
Yakusan said,
  "For sutras, there are sutra specialists; for sastras [1], there are
   sastra specialists. Why do you have doubts about this old monk [2] ?"

[1]: Books on Buddhist doctrines, written by ancient Buddhist philosophers.
[2]: i.e. Yakusan.

<strong><big><a name="08"></a>Case 8: Hyakujo and the Fox [1]</big></strong><big></big>

Whenever Master Hyakujo delivered a sermon, an old man was always there
listening with the monks. When they left, he left too. One day, however, he
remained behind. Hyakujo asked him,
  "What man are you, standing there?"
The old man replied,
  "In the past, in the time of Kashyapa Buddha, I lived on this mountain as a
   Zen priest. Once a monk came and asked me, 'Does a perfectly enlightened
   person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?' I said to him,
   'He does not.' Because of this answer, I fell into the state of a fox for
   500 lives. Now, I beg you, Master, please say a turning word."
Hyakujo said,
  "The law of cause and effect cannot be obscured."
Upon hearing this, the old man became greatly enlightened.

[1]: see case 2 of Mumonkan.

<strong><big><a name="09"></a>Case 9: Nansen Kills a Cat [1]</big></strong><big></big>

Once the monks of the eastern and western Zen halls in Nansen's temple were
quarrelling about a cat. As he saw this, Nansen held up the cat and said,
  "You monks! If one of you can say a word, I will not slay the cat."
No one could answer. Nansen cut the cat in two. Nansen told Joshu what had
happened, and asked him for his view. Joshu thereupon took his sandals, put
them upon his head and went away. Nansen said,
  "If you had been there, I could have spared the cat."

[1]: see case 14 of Mumonkan and cases 63 and 64 of Hekiganroku.

<strong><big><a name="10"></a>Case 10: An Old Woman near Taizan </big></strong><big></big>[1]

There was an old woman on the way to Taizan. Whenever a monk asked her how to
get to Taizan, she would answer, "Go straight on." After the monk had gone a
few steps, she would say, "This good and naïve fellow goes off that way, too."
Later a monk told Joshu about this. Joshu said,
  "Wait a bit. I will go and see through her for you."
He went and asked the same question. The next day, Joshu ascended the rostrum
and said,
  "I have seen through the old woman for you."

[1]: see case 31 of Mumonkan.

<strong><big><a name="11"></a>Case 11: Unmon's "Two Diseases"</big></strong><big></big>

Great Master Unmon said,
  "When the light does not penetrate, there are two diseases. Everything is
   unclear and things hang before you: this is one disease. Even after you
   have realized the emptiness of all things, somehow you feel as if there were
   still something there. This shows that the light has not yet penetrated
   thoroughly.
   Also there are two diseases concerning the Dharma-body. You have reached the
   Dharma-body, but you remain attached to the Dharma and cannot extinguish your
   own view; therefore you lead a corrupt life around the Dharma-body: this is
   one disease. Suppose you have truly penetrated to the end, if you give up
   further efforts, it will not do. You examine yourself minutely and say you
   have no flaw: this is nothing but a disease."

<strong><big><a name="12"></a>Case 12: Jizo Plants the Rice Field</big></strong><big></big>

Jizo asked Shuzanshu,
  "Where have you come from?"
Shuzanshu said,
  "I have come from the South."
Jizo said,
  "How is Buddhism in the South these days?"
Shuzanshu said,
  "There is much lively discussion."
Jizo said,
  "How could that match with our planting the rice field here and making
   rice-balls to eat?"
Shuzanshu said,
  "How could you then save the beings of the Three Worlds?"
Jizo said,
  "What do you call 'the Three Worlds'?"

<strong><big><a name="13"></a>Case 13: Rinzai's "Blind Donkey"</big></strong><big></big>

When Rinzai was about to die, he entrusted Sansho with his Dharma and said,
  "After my passing, do not destroy my treasury of the Eye of the true
   Dharma [1]."
Sansho said,
  "How would I dare destroy your treasury of the Eye of the true Dharma?"
Rinzai said,
  "If someone asks you about it, how will you answer?"
Sansho instantly shouted his Kaatz. Rinzai said,
  "Who knows that my treasury of the Eye of the true Dharma has been
   destroyed by this blind donkey?"

[1]: Originally: shobogenzo.

<strong><big><a name="14"></a>Case 14: Attendant Kaku Offers Tea</big></strong><big></big>

Attendant Kaku asked Tokusan,
  "Where have all the past saints gone?"
Tokusan said,
  "What? What?"
Kaku said,
  "I gave the command for an excellent horse like a flying dragon to spring
   forth, but there came out only a lame tortoise."
Tokusan was silent. The next day, when Tokusan came out of the bath, Kaku
served him tea. Tokusan passed his hand gently over Kaku's back. Kaku said,
  "This old fellow has gotten a glimpse for the first time."
Again, Tokusan was silent.

<strong><big><a name="15"></a>Case 15: Kyozan Thrusts His Hoe into the Ground</big></strong><big></big>

Isan asked Kyozan,
  "Where have you come from?"
Kyozan said,
  "From the rice field."
Isan said,
  "How many people are there in the rice field?"
Kyozan thrust his hoe into the ground and stood with his hands folded on his
chest. Isan said,
  "There are a great number of people cutting thatch on the South Mountain."
Kyozan took up his hoe and left immediately.

<strong><big><a name="16"></a>Case 16: Mayoku Shook the Ring-Staff [1]</big></strong><big></big>

Mayoku, with his ring-staff in hand, came to Shokei. He circled Shokei's dais
three times, shook the ring-staff and stood there bolt upright. Shokei said,
  "Right, right!"
Mayoku then came to Nansen. He circled Nansen's dais three times, shook the
ring-staff and stood there bolt upright. Nansen said,
  "Not right, not right!"
Then, Mayoku said,
  "Master Shokei said, 'Right, right!' Why, Master, do you say, 'Not right,
   not right!'?"
Nansen said,
  "With Shokei it is right, but with you it is not right. This is nothing
   but a whirling of the wind. In the end, it will perish."

[1]: see case 31 of Hekiganroku.

<strong><big><a name="17"></a>Case 17: Hogen's "Hairsbreadth"</big></strong><big></big>

Hogen asked Shuzanshu,
  "'If there is only a hairsbreadth of difference, it is the distance between
   heaven and earth.'[1] How do you understand that?"
Shuzanshu said,
  "If there is only a hairsbreadth of difference, it is the distance between
   heaven and earth."
Hogen said,
  "If that's your understanding, how could you ever attain IT?"
Shuzanshu said,
  "My view is just that. How about you, Master?"
Hogen said,
  "If there only is a hairsbreadth of difference, it is the distance between
   heaven and earth."
Shuzanshu made a deep bow.

[1]: Cited from the Shinjinmei (A Hymn of Sincere Mind), a work by the Third
     Patriarch Sosan. See also Miscellaneous Koans 21-2.

<strong><big><a name="18"></a>Case 18: Joshu's Dog [1]</big></strong><big></big>

A monk asked Joshu,
  "Does the dog have buddha-nature, or not?"
Joshu said,
  "It has" [U].
The monk said,
  "If it has it, why did it creep into that skin bag?"
Joshu said,
  "Because it does so knowingly."
Another monk asked,
  "Does the dog have buddha-nature, or not?"
Joshu said,
  "It has not" [Mu].
The monk said,
  "All living beings have buddha-nature [2]. Why doesn't the dog have any?"
Joshu said,
  "Because it is in its karma-consciousness."

[1]: see case 1 of Mumonkan: the Shoyoroku case presents a fuller text of
     the dialogue.
[2]: Quotation from the Nirvana Sutra 7, 25.

<strong><big><a name="19"></a>Case 19: Unmon's "Mt. Sumeru"</big></strong><big></big>

A monk asked Unmon,
  "Not a single thought arises: is there any fault or not?"
Unmon said,
  "Mt. Sumeru. [1]"

[1]: The highest and most massive mountain in the world according to the
     Indian cosmology.

<strong><big><a name="20"></a>Case 20: Jizo's "Most Intimate"</big></strong><big></big>

Jizo asked Hogen,
  "Where are you going, senior monk? [1]"
Hogen said,
  "I am on pilgrimage [2], following the wind."
Jizo said,
  "What are you on pilgrimage for?"
Hogen said,
  "I don't know."
Jizo said,
  "Non knowing is most intimate."
Hogen suddenly attained great enlightenment.

[1]: "Senior monk" (joza) is an honorific for a monk who has practiced more
     than 10 years.
[2]: Originally: angya.

<strong><big><a name="21"></a>Case 21: Ungan Sweeps the Ground</big></strong><big></big>

When Ungan was sweeping the ground, Dogo said,
  "You are having a hard time!"
Ungan said,
  "You should know there is one who doesn't have a hard time."
Dogo said,
  "If that's true, you mean there is a second moon?"
Ungan held up his broom and said,
  "What number of moon is this?"
Dogo was silent.
Gensha said,
  "That is precisely the second moon."
Unmon said,
  "The servant greets the maid politely."

<strong><big><a name="22"></a>Case 22: Ganto's Bow to the Kaatz</big></strong><big></big>

Ganto came to Tokusan. He straddled the threshold of the gate and asked,
  "Is this ordinary or is this holy?"
Tokusan shouted,
  "Kaatz!"
Ganto made a deep bow.
Hearing of this, Tozan said,
  "Hardly anyone but Ganto could have accepted it that way."
Ganto said,
  "Old Tozan can't tell between good and bad. At that time, I raised up with
   one hand and suppressed with the other."

<strong><big><a name="23"></a>Case 23: Roso Faces the Wall</big></strong><big></big>

Whenever Roso saw a monk coming, he immediately sat facing the wall. Hearing
of this, Nansen said,
  "I usually tell my people to realize what has existed before the kalpa of
   emptiness [1], or to understand what has been before Buddhas appeared in
   the world. Still, I haven't acknowledged one disciple or even a half. If
   he continues that way, he will go on even until the year of the donkey [2]."

[1]: One of the "four kalpas" or periods of cosmic changes: the kalpa of
     creation, the kalpa of existence, the kalpa of destruction, and the kalpa
     of emptiness.
[2]: Since there is no "year of the donkey" in the Chinese zodiac, the
     expression "until the year of donkey" means endlessly.

<strong><big><a name="24"></a>Case 24: Seppo's "Look at the Snake" [1]</big></strong><big></big>

Seppo, instructing the assembly, said,
  "There's a poisonous snake on the southern side of the mountain. All of you
   should look at it carefully!"
Chokei said,
  "Today in the Zen hall there are many people. They have lost their body
   and life."
A monk told this to Gensha, who said,
  "Only Elder Brother Ryo [2] could say something like that. However,
   I wouldn't talk like that."
The monk asked,
  "What then would you say, Master"?
Gensha replied,
  "Why does it have to be 'the southern side of the mountain'?"
Unmon threw his staff in front of Seppo and acted frightened.

[1]: see case 22 of Hekiganroku.
[2]: i.e. Chokei.

<strong><big><a name="25"></a>Case 25: Enkan's "Rhinoceros Fan" [1]</big></strong><big></big>

One day, Enkan called to his attendant,
  "Bring me the rhinoceros fan."
The attendant said,
  "It is broken."
Enkan said,
  "If the fan is already broken, bring me the rhinoceros himself."
The attendant gave no answer.
Shifuku drew a circle and wrote the ideograph "ox [2]" in it.

[1]: see case 91 of Hekiganroku.
[2]:  The Chinese character for "ox" (gyu) is one of the two characters for
     "rhinoceros" (saigyu = sai + gyu).

<strong><big><a name="26"></a>Case 26: Kyozan Points to Snow</big></strong><big></big>

Kyozan pointed to the snow lion [1] and said,
  "Is there any [2] that goes beyond this color?"
Unmon said [3],
  "I would have pushed it over for him at once."
Setcho said [4],
  "He only knows how to push it over, but he doesn't know how to help it up."

[1]: Probably a lion made of snow or a stone lion covered with snow.
[2]: I.e., "anyone" or "anything."
[3]: I.e., later.
[4]: I.e., hearing of this.

<strong><big><a name="28"></a>Case 28: Gokoku's "Three Disgraces"</big></strong><big></big>

A monk asked Gokoku,
  "How about when a crane perches on a withered pine tree?"
Gokoku said,
  "It is a disgrace when seen from the ground."
The monk asked,
  "What about when every drop of water is frozen at once?"
Gokoku said,
  "It's a disgrace after the sun has risen."
The monk asked,
  "At the time of the Esho Persecution [1], where did the good Guardian
   Deities [2] of the Dharma go?"
Gokoku said,
  "It is a disgrace for the two of them on both sides of the temple gate."

[1]: Buddhism was suppressed by order of Emperor Bu (about 840).
[2]: Nio-figures representing the two Deva kings on each side of the main gate
     of a Buddhist temple. They are considered to be protectors of the Dharma.

<strong><big><a name="29"></a>Case 29: Fuketsu's "Iron Ox" [1]</big></strong><big></big>

When he was staying at the government office of the Province Ei, Fuketsu
entered the hall [to preach] and said,
  "The heart seal [stamp] of the patriarch resembles the activity of the iron
   ox. When it goes away, the [impression of the] seal remains; when it stays
   there, the [impression of the] seal is brought to naught. If it neither
   goes away nor stays, would it be right to give a seal [of approval] or not?"

Then Elder Rohi came up and said,
  "I have the activities of the iron ox. [However,] I ask you, Master, not to
   give me the seal."

Fuketsu said,
  "I am accustomed to leveling the great ocean through fishing whales. But,
   alas, now I find instead a frog wriggling about in the mud."

Rohi stood there considering.

Fuketsu shouted
  "Kaatz!"
and said,
  "Why don't you say anything else, Elder?"

Rohi was perplexed.

Fuketsu hit him with his whisk and said,
  "Do you remember what you said? Say something, I'll check it for you."

Rohi tried to say something. Fuketsu hit him again with his whisk.

The Magistrate said,
  "Buddha's law and the King's law are of the same nature."

Fuketsu said,
  "What principle do you see in them?"

The Magistrate said,
  "If you do not make a decision where a decision should be made, you are
   inviting disorder."

Fuketsu descended from the rostrum.

A monk asked Daizui,
  "When the great kalpa fire bursts out, the whole universe [2] will be
   destroyed. I wonder if IT will also be destroyed or not."
Daizui said,
  "Destroyed."
The monk said,
  "If so, will IT be gone with the other [3]?"
Daizui said,
  "Gone with the other."

A monk asked Ryusai,
  "When the great kalpa fire bursts out, the whole universe will be
   destroyed. I wonder if IT will also be destroyed or not."
Ryusai said,
  "Not destroyed."
The monk said,
  "Why is it not destroyed?"
Ryusai said,
  "Because it is the same as the whole universe."

[1]: see case 29 of Hekiganroku: The Shoyoroku case has an additional part
     with Ryusai.
[2]: Literally: "a billion worlds."

Kyozan asked a monk,
  "Where do you come from?"
The monk said,
  "I am from Yu Province"
Kyozan said,
  "Do you think of that place?"
The monk said,
  "I always do."
Kyozan said,
  "That which thinks is the mind [1]. That which is thought about is the
   objective world. Within that are mountains, rivers and the great earth,
   towers, palaces, people, animals, and other things. Reflect upon the mind
   that thinks. Are there a lot of things there?"
The monk said,
  "I don't see anything at all there."
Kyozan said,
  "That's right for the stage of understanding, but not yet for the stage of
   personalization."
The monk said,
  "Do you have any special advice, Master?"
Kyozan said,
  "It is not right to say that there is or there is not. Your insight shows
   that you have obtained only one side of the mystery. Sitting down, putting
   on clothes, from now on you see by yourself."

Seppo said,
  "I will tell you when you have passed through the net."
Sansho said,
  "A great Zen master with 1500 disciples doesn't know how to speak."

Fuketsu, giving instruction, said,
  "If one raises a speck of dust, the house and the nation prosper. If one

<strong><big><a name="35"></a>Case 35: Rakuho's Obeisance</big></strong><big></big>

Rakuho came to Kassan and without bowing stood facing him. Kassan said,
  "A chicken dwells in the phoenix nest. It's not of the same class. Go away."
Rakuho said,
  "I have come from far away, hearing much about you. Please, Master, I beg
   you to guide me."
Kassan said,
  "Before my eyes there is no you, and here there is no old monk [1]."
Rakuho shouted,
  "Kaatz!"
Kassan said,
  "Stop it, stop it. Don't be so careless and hasty. Clouds and the moon are
   the same; valleys and mountains are different from each other. It is not
   difficult to cut off the tongues of the people under heaven. But how can
   you make a tongueless person speak?"
Rakuho said nothing. Kassan hit him. With this, Rakuho started to obey Kassan.

Isan asked Kyozan,
  "Suppose a man asks you, saying, 'All living beings are tossed in a vast
   karma-consciousness, and have no foundation to rely upon.' How would
   you check him?"
Kyozan said,
  "If such a monk appears, I call out to him, 'Mr. So-and-so!' When he turns
   his head, instantly I say, 'What is this?' If he hesitates, then I say to
   him, 'Not only is there a vast karma-consciousness, but also there is no
   foundation to rely upon.'"
Isan said,
  "Good."

<strong><big><a name="38"></a>Case 38: Rinzai's "True Person"</big></strong><big></big>

Rinzai instructed his assembly and said,
  "There is one true person of no rank, always coming out and going in
   through the gates of your face [1]. Beginners who have not yet witnessed
   that, look! look!"
Then a monk came out and asked,
  "What is the one true person of no rank?"
Rinzai descended from the rostrum and grabbed him. The monk hesitated.
Rinzai pushed him away and said,
  "The true person of no rank -- what a shit-stick you are!"

[1]: I.e., sense organs such as eyes, nose, ears, tongue, etc.

<strong><big><a name="40"></a>Case 40: Unmon's "White and Black"</big></strong><big></big>

Unmon asked Kempo,
  "May I ask for your answer [1]?"
Kempo said,
  "Have you ever reached this old monk or not?"
Unmon said,
  "If so, I must say I was too late."
Kempo said,
  "Is that so? Is that so?"
Unmon said,
  "I thought I was Marquis White, but I find that here is Marquise Black [2]."

[1]: A literal translation. It is possible to understand the word simply as
     "instruction."
[2]: Marquis White and Marquise Black are noted thieves in Chinese folklore.
     Marquise Black, a female thief, seems to have been the cleverer of the two.

<strong><big><a name="41"></a>Case 41: Rakuho at His Deathbed</big></strong><big></big>

When he was about to die, Rakuho addressed his assembly and said,
  "I have one matter to ask you about. If you say 'yes' to this, you are
   putting another head on your own. If you say 'no,' you are looking for life
   by cutting off your head."
The head monk said,
  "The green mountain always lifts up its legs; you don't need to carry a
   lantern in the daylight." [1]
Rakuho said,
  "What time is this to utter such a saying?"
A senior monk named Genjo stepped forward and said,
  "Apart from these two ways, I beg you, Master, not to ask."
Rakuho said,
  "That's not enough. Say some more."
Genjo said,
  "I cannot say it fully."
Rakuho said,
  "I don't care whether or not you can say it fully."
Genjo said,
  "I feel just like an attendant who has nothing to respond to his master." [2]
That evening, Rakuho called Genjo to him and said,
  "Your response today had something quite reasonable. You have to realize
   what our late master [3] said,
     'There are no dharmas before the eyes,
      Yet consciousness is before the eyes.
      IT is not the Dharma before the eyes,
      IT cannot be reached by eyes and ears.'
   Which phrase is the guest? Which phrase is the host? If you can sort them
   out, I will transmit the bowl and robe to you."
Genjo said,
  "I don't understand."
Rakuho said,
  "You must understand."
Genjo said,
  "I really don't understand."
Rakuho uttered a kaatz and said,
  "Miserable, miserable!"
[Another] monk asked,
  "What would you like to say, Master?"
Rakuho said,
  "The boat of compassion is not rowed over pure waves. It's been wasted
   labor releasing wooden geese down the precipitous strait [4]."

[1]: Most probably a saying formed by Rakuho himself.
[2]: Apparently an idiomatic expression meaning, "I can't describe it in words."
[3]: Rinzai or Kassan.
[4]: It was a custom that the boat rushing down the stream through a gorge
     released pieces of wood ahead as a warning so that a possible crash with
     the boat coming upstream could be avoided. These wooden chips were
     called "wooden geese."

A monk asked National Teacher Chu of Nanyo,
  "What is the essential body [1] of Vairocana Buddha [2]?"
National Teacher said,
  "Pass me that water jug."
The monk passed him the water jug. National Teacher said,
  "Put it back where it was."
The monk asked again,
  "What is the essential body of Vairocana Buddha?"
National Teacher said,
  "The old Buddha is long gone."

[1]: The so-called "Dharma-body" or dharmakaya.
[2]: The principal Buddha.

<strong><big><a name="44"></a>Case 44: Koyo's "Suparnin"</big></strong><big></big>

A monk asked Master Ho of Koyo,
  "The great dragon has emerged from the ocean, calming heaven and earth. How
   will you treat him when he suddenly appears before you?"
Master Ho said,
  "Suparnin [1], the king of birds, absorbs the entire universe. Who can
   stick his head within him?"
The monk said,
  "But how about when he does appear?"
Ho said,
  "It is like a falcon catching a pigeon. If you don't realize it, you will
   learn the truth through the 'inspection before the balcony.' [2]"
The monk said,
  "If so, then I'll fold my hands on my chest and retreat three steps."
Ho said,
  "You black tortoise under the Sumeru altar. [3] Don't wait to be struck on
   the forehead again and get hurt."

[1]: A giant bird that eats even dragons.
[2]: A reference to a story in which Heigenkun Chosho, the brother of the king
     of Cho and a wealthy landlord with 3,000 dependents, built a grand palace
     with a balcony that overlooked the main road. One day a crippled person
     was passing by and one of the concubines saw him and laughed. The crippled
     person was angered and demanded Heigenkun her head. Heigenkun presented
     the head of an executed convict as the head of the concubine. His
     dependents knew of his deception, lost faith in their master and gradually
     all left him. His fortunes declined, so at last he cut off the head of
     the concubine and presented it for the crippled person to inspect. After
     that the dependents returned and his fortunes were restored. The story is
     an allusion to the fact that you can never hide away the real truth.
[3]: A reference to one of the four carved figures, representing black
     tortoises, underneath the Sumeru altar (with the Buddha statue). It is
     used here as a symbol of someone who has lost the freedom of movement.

<strong><big><a name="45"></a>Case 45: Four Phrases from the Engaku Sutra</big></strong><big></big>

The Engaku [1] Sutra says:
  "At all times, you do not raise the delusive mind.
   When there are all kinds of illusory thoughts, you do not extinguish them.
   Dwelling in the delusory state of mind, you do not add understanding.
   Where there is no understanding, you do not distinguish the truth."

[1]: "Engaku" means the perfect awakening of Buddha.

<strong><big><a name="46"></a>Case 46: Tokusan's "Study Accomplished"</big></strong><big></big>

Great Master Tokusan Emmyo instructed his assembly and said,
  "If you have exhausted to the end, you will realize right away that all
   buddhas in the three worlds have stuck their mouths to the wall [1].
   Yet there is still one person ¡© he is giving a great laugh. If you can
   recognize that person, you have accomplished your study."

<strong><big><a name="48"></a>Case 48: Vimalakirti's "Not-Two" </big></strong><big></big>[1]

Vimalakirti asked Manjusri,
  "What does it mean that the Bodhisattva enters the Dharma-gate of Not-Two?"
Manjusri said,
  "I see it like this: in all phenomena, there are neither words nor
   explanations, neither presentations nor knowledge; it is beyond all
   questions and answers. That is what I understand with 'to enter the
   Dharma-gate of Not-Two'."
Then Manjusri asked Vimalakirti,
  "All of us have finished giving our explanations. Now you should give your
   explanation. What does it mean that the Bodhisattva enters the
   Dharma-gate of Not-Two?"
Vimalakirti remained silent.

<strong><big><a name="49"></a>Case 49: Tozan and the Memorial Service</big></strong><big></big>

When Tozan held a memorial service for Ungan before his portrait, he mentioned
the episode with the portrait [1]. A monk came forward and asked,
  "When Ungan said, 'Just this!' what did that mean?"
Tozan said,
  "At that time, I almost misunderstood my master's meaning."
The monk said,
  "I wonder whether or not Ungan really knew that IT is."
Tozan said,
  "If he did not know that it is, how could he say like that? If he knew that
   it is, how did he dare say like that?"

[1]: Tozan was still a young monk under Ungan. One day, when he was leaving his
     master, he asked Ungan, "After your passing, if I am asked by someone
     whether I have your portrait, what should I answer?" Ungan was silent for
     a while and then said, "Just this."

<strong><big><a name="50"></a>Case 50: Seppo's "What Is This?" </big></strong><big></big>[1]

When Seppo was living in a hermitage, two monks came to pay their respects.
When he saw them coming, Seppo thrust open the gate of his hermitage with his
hands, jumped out, and said,
  "What is this?"
The monks also said,
  "What is this?"
Seppo hung his head and retired into his hermitage.

Later, the monks came to Ganto. He asked them,
  "Where have you come from?"
The monks said,
  "From Reinan."
Ganto said,
  "Did you ever visit Seppo?"
The monks said,
  "Yes, we visited him."
Ganto said,
  "What did he say?"
The monks related what had happened. Ganto said,
   "What else did he say?"
The monks said,
  "Not a word; he hung his head and retired into his hermitage."
Ganto said,
  "Oh, how I regret now that in those days I did not tell him the last word!
   If I had told it to him, no one under heaven could do anything against him."

At the end of the summer practice period the monks came back to this
conversation and asked him about its meaning. Ganto said,
  "Why didn't you ask me about it sooner?"
The monks said,
  "We could not dare to ask you about it."
Ganto said,
  "Seppo was born on the same stem as I, but he will not die on the same
   stem. If you want to know the last word, it is just this."

   How do you explain the principle of this corresponding?"
Toku said,
  "It is like a donkey looking into a well."
Sozan said,

Now a monk came forward and said,

Ungan said,
  "I understood."
Dogo said,

Ungan said,

Seppo came to Tokusan and became in charge of cooking food. One day, the lunch
was late. Tokusan came down to the hall carrying his bowls. Seppo said,
  "Old Master, the bell has not yet rung nor the drum sounded. Where are you
   going with your bowls?"
Thereupon Tokusan went back to his room. Seppo told this to Ganto.
Ganto said,
  "Great Tokusan though he is, he has not yet realized the last word."

Hearing of this, Tokusan sent his attendant to summon Ganto and then asked him,
  "Don't you approve of this old monk?"
Ganto whispered his intention. Tokusan remained silent. Sure enough, the next
day, when Tokusan ascended the rostrum, his talk was quite different from
usual. Ganto, rubbing his hands together, laughed and said,
  "Wonderful! How happy I am that our Old Man has realized the last word.
   From now on he'll be subject to no one on earth."

Misshi said,
  "It is just like a person in white clothes [2] being venerated as a prime

Tozan said,
  "You are such an elderly and respectable man, and still you say something
   like that?"
Misshi said,
  "Then how about you?"
Tozan said,
  "A noble of an ancient house is temporarily fallen into poverty."

  "The grass is so deep, there is no place to look for it."
The monk said,
  "You too, Master, must be watchful in order to get it."
Seirin clapped his hands and said,
  "This fellow is equally poisonous."

A monk asked Master Kempo in all earnestness,
  "In a certain sutra it says, 'Ten-direction Bhagavats, one Way to the gate
   of nirvana.' I wonder where the Way is."
Kempo lifted up his stick, drew a line and said,
  "Here it is."
The monk told Unmon about this and asked him. Unmon said,
  "This fan jumps up to the heaven of the thirty-three devas and adheres to
   the nose of the deva Taishaku. When a carp in the eastern sea is struck
   with a stick, it rains torrents as though a tray of water is overturned."

<strong><big><a name="62"></a>Case 62: Beiko's "Enlightenment"</big></strong><big></big>

Beiko had a monk ask Kyozan,
  "Do people these days really need enlightenment or not?"
Kyozan said,
  "It is not that there is no enlightenment, but how can it be helped that it
   falls into the second class?"
The monk went back to Beiko and told him about it. Beiko deeply agreed.

<strong><big><a name="64"></a>Case 64: Shisho's "Succession"</big></strong><big></big>

Head Monk Shisho [1] asked Hogen,
  "You have opened a zendo, Master. But who did you succeed to?"
Hogen said,
  "Master Jizo."
Shisho said,
  "You have gone a great deal against your late master Chokei." [2]
Hogen said,
  "I still don't understand a turning word of Chokei's."
Shisho said,
  "Why didn't you ask me?"
Hogen said,
  "'The one body manifests itself in myriad phenomena', what does it mean?"
Shisho stuck up his whisk. Hogen said,
  "That is what you learned under Chokei. What is your own view, Head Monk?"
Shisho was silent. Hogen said,
  "When it is said, 'The one body manifests itself in myriad phenomena', are
   the myriad phenomena swept away or are they not?"
Shisho said,
  "Not swept away."
Hogen said,
  "There are two."
All the disciples on the right and the left side said,
  "Swept away."
Hogen said,
  "The one body manifests itself in myriad phenomena, Nii [3]!"

[1]: Shisho was a disciple of Master Chokei.
[2]: Hogen once practiced under Master Chokei.
[3]: A word used to point something out.

<strong><big><a name="65"></a>Case 65: Shuzan's "Bride"</big></strong><big></big>

A monk asked Shuzan,

  "What is the head?"
Kyuho said,
  "Opening the eyes and not perceiving the dawn."
The monk said,
  "What is the tail?"
Kyuho said,
  "Not sitting on a ten-thousand-year-old sitting place."
The monk said,
  "What if there is a head, but no tail?"
Kyuho said,
  "After all, it is not valuable."
The monk said,
  "What if there is a tail, but no head?"
Kyuho said,
  "Being complacent, yet having no power."
The monk said,
  "What if the head matches the tail?"
Kyuho said,
  "The descendants will prosper, but it is not known in the room."

<strong><big><a name="67"></a>Case 67: The Wisdom in the Kegon Sutra</big></strong><big></big>

   delusions and attachments, they cannot realize it."

<strong><big><a name="68"></a>Case 68: Kassan Brandishes the Sword</big></strong><big></big>

A monk asked Kassan,
  "What if one sweeps away the dust and sees Buddha?"
Kassan said,
  "You must brandish your sword. If you do not brandish your sword, the
   fisherman dwells in a nest of reeds [1]."
The monk mentioned this to Sekiso and asked him,
  "What if one sweeps away the dust and sees Buddha?"
Sekiso said,
  "He has no country. Where can one meet him?"
The monk reported this to Kassan. Kassan ascended the rostrum and said,
  "As for the facilities in the garden [2], the old monk [3] is superior to
   Sekiso, but for deep discourse expounding the true principle he is one
   hundred steps ahead of me."

[1]: That is, unable to catch a single fish.
[2]: Better teaching methods.
[3]: I.e., "I."

<strong><big><a name="69"></a>Case 69: Nansen's "Cats and Oxen"</big></strong><big></big>

[1]: The past, present and future.

<strong><big><a name="70"></a>Case 70: Shinsan Asks about Nature</big></strong><big></big>

Master Shinsan asked Master Shuzan [1],
  "After you have clearly known the unborn nature of life, why are you still
   attached to life?"
Shuzan said,
  "The bamboo shoot necessarily becomes a bamboo. But is it possible to make
   a bamboo rope [2] already out of a bamboo shoot? [3]"
Shinsan said,
  "Later you will realize it yourself."
Shuzan said,
  "My view is just as I said. What is your view?"
Shinsan said,
  "This is the temple steward's quarters, and that is the cooks' quarters."
Shuzan made a deep bow.

[1]: The two masters were Dharma brothers.
[2]: A rope made out of thin bamboo tops.
[3]: That is, I am still "a bamboo shoot"; you cannot make "a bamboo rope" out
     of me.

<strong><big><a name="71"></a>Case 71: Suigan's "Eyebrows" </big></strong><big></big>[1]

Towards the end of summer [2], Suigan instructed the assembly, saying,
  "All summer I've preached to you, my brothers. Look here, are Suigan's
   eyebrows still there? [3]"
Hofuku said,
  "The robber's heart is terrified!"
Chokei said,
  "They are well grown!"
Unmon said,
  "Barrier [4]!"

[1]: see case 8 of Hekiganroku.
[2]: Summer-sesshin for 3 months.
[3]: According to the popular belief a great criminal should lose his eyebrows
     as a sign of his coming punishment in hell.
[4]: Literally kan means "barrier" (cf. Mumonkan). In those days this Chinese
     word colloquially meant also, "Watch out!" or "There!"

<strong><big><a name="72"></a>Case 72: Chuyu's "Monkey"</big></strong><big></big>

Kyozan [1] asked Chuyu,
  "What does buddha-nature mean?"
Chuyu said,
  "I will explain it for you by allegory. Suppose there is a room with six
   windows. Inside there is a monkey. Outside, someone shouts, 'Monkey!
   monkey!' It immediately responds. If someone calls, 'Monkey!' through any
   of the windows, it responds just the same. It is just like that."
Kyozan said,
  "How about when the monkey is asleep?"
Chuyu descended from his Zen seat, grasped Kyozan and said,
  "O monkey, monkey, there you are!"

[1]: At this time Kyozan was about 13 years old.

<strong><big><a name="73"></a>Case 73: Sozan's Filial Fulfillment</big></strong><big></big>

A monk asked Sozan,
  "When one leaves off his mourning clothes [1], how about that?"
Sozan said,
  "Sozan today has fulfilled filial piety."
The monk said,
  "How about after you have fulfilled piety?"
Sozan said,
  "Sozan loves to get drunk."

[1]: In Japanese: Reii. The mourning closes that one wore when one of the
     parents was dead. Here it is symbolically used to designate the clothes
     during Zen practice.

<strong><big><a name="74"></a>Case 74: Hogen's "Form and Name"</big></strong><big></big>

A monk asked Hogen,
  "I hear that a sutra says,
     'From the basis of non-abiding all dharmas are established.'
   What is this basis of non-abiding?"
Hogen said,
  "Form arises from what has no substance yet; name comes from what has no
   name yet."

<strong><big><a name="75"></a>Case 75: Zuigan's "Everlasting Principle"</big></strong><big></big>

Zuigan [1] asked Ganto,
  "What is the intrinsic, everlasting principle?"
Ganto said,
  "It has moved."
Zuigan said,
  "What if it moves?"
Ganto said,
  "You can't see the intrinsic, everlasting principle."
Zuigan thought for a moment. Ganto said,
  "If you acknowledge it, you are not yet free from the roots and their
   dust [2]. If you do not acknowledge it, you are immersed in endless birth
   and death."

[1]: At the time of this dialogue Zuigan was still a young boy.
[2]: The "roots" means "six roots" of sense organs: eye, ear, nose, tongue,
     body, consciousness. "Dust", more exactly "six dust particles," means the
     objects of the six sense organs: form, sound, smell, taste, things to be
     touched, objects of mind.

<strong><big><a name="76"></a>Case 76: Shuzan's Three Verses</big></strong><big></big>

Shuzan instructed his assembly and said,
  "If you attain the first verse, you will be the teacher of buddhas and
   patriarchs. If you attain the second verse, you will be the teacher of
   heaven and humankind. If you attain the third verse, you cannot save even
   yourself."
A monk asked,
  "Which verse did Your Reverence attain?"
Shuzan said,
  "The moon is set at midnight; I walk alone through the market place of
   the city."

<strong><big><a name="77"></a>Case 77: Kyozan: As His Profession Requires</big></strong><big></big>

A monk asked Kyozan,
  "Your Reverence, do you know letters or not?"
Kyozan said,
  "According to my capacity."
The monk immediately turned around once clockwise and said,
  "What letter is this?"
Kyozan drew the ideograph for "10" [ + ] in the earth. The monk turned
himself around once counter-clockwise and said,
  "What letter is that?"
Kyozan modified the sign" + " into a swastika [1]. The monk drew a circle in
the air and lifted his two palms like Asura [2] vigorously holding the sun
and moon and said,
  "What letter is that?"
Kyozan immediately drew a circle enclosing the swastika. The monk at once
represented the vigor of a Rucika [3]. Kyozan said,
  "Good, good. Keep it with care."

[1]: Manji in Japanese; a symbol of Buddhism.
[2]: Originally a Hindu deity, here one of the eight supernatural protectors
     of Buddhist Way.
[3]: The buddha Rucika wailed at his fate at first because he was the last of
     the thousand buddhas in this cosmic period. But then he made up his mind
     to be the energetic protector of the Dharma for all other buddhas. Two
     powerful figures of this buddha are seen at the entrance gate of many
     temples in Japan (named Nio).

<strong><big><a name="78"></a>Case 78: Unmon's "Rice Cake" </big></strong><big></big>[1]

A monk asked Unmon,
  "What is meant by the pronouncement 'to go beyond the Buddha and the
   patriarchs'?"
Unmon said,
  "Poor rice cake [2]."

[1]: see case 77 of Hekiganroku.
[2]: In Japanese: kobyo. Cheap and unrefined cake.

<strong><big><a name="79"></a>Case 79: Chosa Takes a Step</big></strong><big></big>

Chosa had a monk ask Master E,
  "How was it when you had not yet seen Nansen?"
E remained silent. The monk asked,
  "What about after seeing him?"
E said,
  "Nothing special."
The monk returned and told Chosa about this. Chosa said,
  "The man sits on the top of a hundred-foot pole. He has entered the way,
   but it is not yet genuine. He must take one step from the top of a
   hundred-foot pole. The worlds of the ten directions will be his complete
   body." [1]
The monk said,
  "How shall one take a step from the top of a hundred-foot pole?"
Sa said,
  "Mountains of Ro; water of Rei [2]."
The monk said,
  "I don't understand."
Sa said,
  "Four seas and five lakes are all under the imperial reign."

[1]: see case 46 of Mumonkan.
[2]: Ro and Rei are the names of Provinces in the old China.

<strong><big><a name="80"></a>Case 80: Suibi and the Chin Rest </big></strong><big></big>[1]

Ryuge asked Suibi,
  "What is the meaning of the Patriarch's coming from the west?"
Suibi said,
  "Bring me a chin rest [2]."
Ryuge brought one and gave it to him. Suibi took it and hit him.
Ryuge said,
  "You may hit me as you like. After all there is no meaning to the
   Patriarch's coming from the west."

Ryuge also asked Rinzai,
  "What is the meaning of the Patriarch's coming from the west?"
Rinzai said,a
  "Bring me a sitting cushion."
Ryuge got one and gave it to Rinzai. Rinzai took it and hit him. Ryuge said,
  "You may hit me as you like. After all there is no meaning to the
   Patriarch's coming from the west."

Later Ryuge became abbot of a temple. A monk asked him,
  "Master, at that time, when you asked Suibi and Rinzai about the meaning
   of the Patriarch's coming from the west, did they clarify it or not?"
Ryuge said,
  "They clarified it all right. After all, there is no meaning to the
   Patriarch's coming from the west."

[1]: similar to case 20 of Hekiganroku. However, the third paragraph, is
     peculiar to the Shoyoroku.
[2]: Literally: "Zen board." A narrow board used so as to let one sleep in
     the sitting posture.

<strong><big><a name="81"></a>Case 81: Gensha Reaches the Province</big></strong><big></big>

Gensha came to the Province Hoden. He was welcomed with great entertainment.
The next day he asked the head priest, Shoto,
  "All the revelry of yesterday, where has it gone?"
Shoto held out the corner of his Buddhist garment. Gensha said,
  "Far from it, no connection at all."

<strong><big><a name="82"></a>Case 82: Unmon's: "Voice" and "Color"</big></strong><big></big>

Unmon instructed the assembly and said,
  "'To realize the way through hearing a voice, to enlighten the mind through

   and buys poor rice cakes. If he throws it away, he will get nice manju
   cakes instead."

<strong><big><a name="83"></a>Case 83: Dogo's Nursing the Ill</big></strong><big></big>

Isan asked Dogo,
  "Where have you come from?"
Dogo said,
  "I come from nursing the ill."
Isan said,
  "How many people are ill?"
Dogo said,
  "There are some ill, and some not ill."
Isan said,
  "The one who is not ill isn't that you, dear Chi [1]?"
Dogo said,
  "Ill or not ill it has nothing to do with 'that' matter. Say it quickly!
   Say it quickly!"
Isan said,
  "Even if I could say it, it would have no connection with that matter."

[1]: Dogo's full name was Dogo Enchi. "Chi" is short for Enchi.

Emperor Shukuso [2] asked Chu, the national teacher,
  "What would you wish me to do after a hundred years [3]?"
The national teacher said,
  "Make a seamless gravestone [4] for this old monk."
The emperor said,
  "I should like to ask you, master, for a design."
The national teacher remained silent for a long time. Then he said,
  "Did you understand?"
The emperor said,
  "I didn't understand anything."
The national teacher said,
  "I have a Dharma successor, my disciple Tangen, who is well versed with
   this matter."
Afterwards the emperor called Tangen and asked him about the meaning of this.
Tangen responded:
  "The south of the river, north of the lake:
   In between there's gold, which fills the whole land.
   Under the shadowless tree all people are in one boat;
   In the crystal palace there is no one who knows."

[2]: Historically speaking it was Emperor Daiso the oldest son and successor
     of Shukuso.
[3]: After your death.
[4]: An egg-formed gravestone which is made out of a single piece of stone.
     It was often made for deceased monks.

<strong><big><a name="86"></a>Case 86: Rinzai's Great Enlightenment</big></strong><big></big>

Rinzai asked Obaku,
  "What is the great meaning of the Buddha-Dharma?"
Obaku hit him. This happened three times. Rinzai then took his leave and went
to see Daigu. Daigu asked,
  "Where have you come from?"
Rinzai said,
  "From Obaku."
Daigu said,
  "What did Obaku have to say?"
Rinzai said,
  "I asked him three times, 'What is the great meaning of the Buddha-Dharma?'
   and I got his stick three times. I don't know if I was in error or not."
Daigu said,
  "Obaku was overly gentle like an old grandmother; he completely exhausted
   himself for your sake. Yet you come here and ask if you were in error
   or not!"
With these words, Rinzai came to great enlightenment.

<strong><big><a name="87"></a>Case 87: Sozan: With or Without</big></strong><big></big>

Sozan came to Isan and asked,
  "I have heard that you said, 'Words of being and words of non-being are just
   like wisteria wound around a tree.' If suddenly the tree falls down and the
   wisteria withers, where will the words go?"
Isan burst into great laughter. Sozan said,
  "I sold my clothes and other belongings, and made an arduous journey of one
   thousand miles to come to you. Why does Your Reverence make light of me?"
Isan called his attendant and said,
  "Bring some money and give it to this reverend monk for his travel expenses."
Finally he said,
  "Some day a one-eyed dragon will let you open your eyes."
Later Sozan went to Myosho and told him about this. Myosho said,
  "I can say that Isan is completely right, but he did not meet one who could
   appreciate him."
Sozan asked again,
  "If the tree falls down and the wisteria withers, where will the words go?"
Myosho said,
  "It would make Isan laugh again all the more."
Upon hearing this, Sozan gained realization. Then he said,
  "From the beginning, there was a sword behind Isan's laughter."

<strong><big><a name="88"></a>Case 88: "Non-Seeing" in the Ryogon Sutra </big></strong><big></big>[1]

The Ryogon Sutra says,
  "When I don't see, why do you not see what I do not see? If you argue that
   you see what I do not see, that is of course not what I do not see. If you
   do not see what I do not see, then it is quite natural that it is not a
   thing. Why is it not your self?"

<strong><big><a name="89"></a>Case 89: Tozan's "Place of No Grass"</big></strong><big></big>

Tozan instructed the assembly and said,
  "At the beginning of autumn and the end of summer, you, brothers, are

   grass over ten thousand miles."
And again he said,
  "How will you go to the place of no grass over ten thousand miles?"
Sekiso said,
  "When you go out of the gate, there is grass!"
Taiyo said,
  "I would say: Even if you don't go out of the gate, grass is abundant

  "Today the second seat is due to speak."
Kyozan stood up, struck the stand with the gavel, and said,
  "The Dharma of Mahayana is beyond the four propositions and transcends the

<strong><big><a name="91"></a>Case 91: Nansen and the Peonies </big></strong><big></big>[1]

Minister Rikuko said to Nansen,
  "Dharma-teacher Jo is wonderful. He truly knows what he is talking about:
   'Heaven and earth and I have one and the same root; all things and I are
   one single body.'"
Nansen pointed at the peonies in the garden and said,
  "Minister, people of our time [2] see these flowers as in a dream."

[1]: see case 40 of Hekiganroku, which has a slightly different wording.
[2]: I.e. "you".

<strong><big><a name="92"></a>Case 92: Unmon's "One Treasure" </big></strong><big></big>[1]

Unmon said,

Roso [1] asked Nansen,
  "'People do not recognize the Mani[2]-jewel. I picked it up myself in the
   Tathagata treasury.' [3] What is this treasury?"
Nansen said,
  "Old Master O [4] exchanges questions and answers with you. That's it."
Shiso said,
  "How about when there is no exchange of questions and answers?"
Nansen said,
  "That's also the treasury."
Shiso said,
  "What is the jewel?'
Nansen said,
  "Reverend Shiso!"
Shiso said,
  "Yes!"
Nansen said,
  "Get out. You don't understand my words."

[1]: Mistakenly the original text renders "Roso" (Nansen's elder brother in
     Dharma); in reality it should be "Shiso" (Nansen's student), as Nansen's
     question indicates.
[2]: "Mani" in Sanskrit means "perfect freedom" ¡© another name for Buddha
     nature.

<strong><big><a name="94"></a>Case 94: Tozan Unwell</big></strong><big></big>

Tozan was unwell. A monk asked,
  "Your Reverence is unwell. Is there anyone who does not become ill?"
Tozan said,
  "There is."
The monk said,
  "Does the one who does not get ill take care of Your Reverence?"
Tozan said,
  "The old monk is properly taking care of that one."
The monk said,

Tozan said,

The manager said,
  "Yes, I sold all of it."
Rinzai drew a line with his staff and said,
  "Have you sold all of this too?"
The manager shouted,
  "Kaatz!"
Rinzai immediately struck him. Later, the cook monk [1] came to Rinzai, who
told him about this incident. The monk said,
  "The steward didn't understand Your Reverence's intention."
Rinzai said,

acknowledge him. He said,
  "Wait till I examine him. If he understands our late master's spirit and
   intention, I will serve him as I served our late master."
So he asked the head monk,
  "Our late master said,

The head monk said,
  "He clarified the matter of absolute Oneness."
Ho said,

The head monk said,
  "Don't you acknowledge me? Pass me incense."
He lit the incense and said,
  "If I had not understood our late master's spirit, I would not be able to
   pass away while the smoke of this incense rises."

  "Dying while sitting or standing is not impossible. But you could not even
   dream of our late master's spirit."
