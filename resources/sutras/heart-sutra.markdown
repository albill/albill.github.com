# The Heart or Prajnaparamita-Hridaya-Sutra
(Sanskrit:  प्रज्ञापारमिताहृदय; Chinese: 摩訶般若波羅蜜多心經)

### Chinese Text

摩訶般若波羅蜜多心經

觀自在菩薩 行深般若波羅蜜多時 照見 五蘊皆空 度一切苦厄

舍利子 色不異空 空不異色 色卽是空 空卽是色 受想行識 亦復如是

舍利子 是諸法空相 不生不滅 不垢不淨 不增不減

是故 空中無色 無受想行識 無眼耳鼻舌身意 無色聲香味觸法

無眼界 乃至 無意識界 無無明 亦無無明盡 乃至 無老死 亦無老死盡

無苦集滅道 無智亦無得 以無所得故

菩提薩埵 依般若波羅蜜多故 心無罣礙 無罣礙故 無有恐怖 遠離顚倒夢想 究竟涅槃

三世諸佛 依般若波羅蜜多故 得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提

故知 般若波羅蜜多 是大神呪 是大明呪 是無上呪 是無等等呪

能除 一切苦 眞實不虛 故說 般若波羅蜜多呪

卽說呪曰,

揭諦揭諦 波羅揭諦 波羅僧揭諦 菩提娑婆訶

揭諦揭諦 波羅揭諦 波羅僧揭諦 菩提娑婆訶

揭諦揭諦 波羅揭諦 波羅僧揭諦 菩提娑婆訶


### Translated by Edward Conze

### Om Homage to the Perfection of Wisdom the Lovely, the Holy !

Avalokita, the Holy Lord and Bodhisattva, was moving in the deep  course of the Wisdom which has  gone beyond.

He looked down from on high, He beheld but five heaps, and He saw  that in their own-being they were  empty.

Here, O Sariputra,

form is emptiness and the very emptiness is form ;

emptiness does not differ from form, form does not differ from  emptiness, whatever is emptiness,  that is form,

the same is true of feelings, perceptions, impulses, and  consciousness.

Here, O Sariputra,

all dharmas are marked with emptiness ;

they are not produced or stopped, not defiled or immaculate, not  deficient or complete.

Therefore, O Sariputra,

in emptiness there is no form nor feeling, nor perception, nor  impulse, nor consciousness ;

No eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind ; No forms, sounds, smells,  tastes, touchables or objects of  mind ; No sight-organ element, and so forth, until we come to :

No mind-consciousness element ; There is no ignorance, no extinction  of ignorance, and so forth,  until we come to : There is no decay and death, no extinction of decay  and death. There is no  suffering, no origination, no stopping, no path.

There is no cognition, no attainment and no non-attainment.

Therefore, O Sariputra,

it is because of his non-attainmentness that a Bodhisattva, through  having relied on the Perfection of  Wisdom, dwells without thought-coverings. In the absence of  thought-coverings he has not been  made to tremble,

he has overcome what can upset, and in the end he attains to Nirvana.

All those who appear as Buddhas in the three periods of time fully  awake to the utmost, right and  perfect Enlightenment because they have relied on the Perfection of  Wisdom.

Therefore one should know the prajnaparamita as the great spell, the  spell of great knowledge, the  utmost spell, the unequalled spell, allayer of all suffering, in truth  -- for what could go wrong ? By  the prajnaparamita has this spell been delivered. It runs like this :

gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha.

( Gone, gone, gone beyond, gone altogether beyond, O what an  awakening, all-hail!)

This completes the Heart of perfect Wisdom.
