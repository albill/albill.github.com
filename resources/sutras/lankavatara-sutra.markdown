## PREFACE 
 
</a> 
 
It is more than seven years now since I began the study of the <em>Lankavatara  Sutra</em> quite seriously, but owing to various interruptions I have  not been able to carry out my plan as speedily as I wished. My friends  in different fields of life have been kind and generous in various ways,  and I now send out to the perusal of the English-reading public this  humble work of mine. There are yet many difficult and obscure passages  in the Sutra, which I have been unable to unravel to my own  satisfaction. All such imperfections are to be corrected by competent  scholars. I shall be fully content if I have made the understanding of  this significant Mahayana text easier than before, even though this may  be only to a very slight degree. In China Buddhist scholars profoundly  learned and endowed with spiritual insights made three or four attempts  extending over a period of about two hundred and fifty years to give an  intelligible rendering of the <em>Lankavatara</em>. It goes without saying  that these have helped immensely the present translator. May his also  prove a stepping board however feeble towards a fuller interpretation of  the Sutra! 
 
The present English translation is based on the Sanskrit edition of  Bunyu Nanjo's published by the Otani University Press in 1923. 
 
I am most grateful to Mr Dwight Goddard of Thetford, Vermont, U. S.  A., who again helped me by typing the entire manuscript of the present  book. To Assist me in this way was indeed part of the object of his  third visit to this side of the Pacific. Says Confucius, "Is it not  delightful to have a friend come from afar?" The saying applies most  appropriately, to this case. 
 
It was fortunate for the writer that he could secure the support and  help of the Keimeikwai, a corporation organised to help research work of  scholars in various fields of culture; for without it his work might  have dragged on yet for some time to come. There is so much to be  accomplished before he has to appear at the court of Emma Daiwo, to whom  he could say, "Here is my work; humble though it is, I have tried to do  my part to the full extent of my power." The writer renders his  grateful acknowledgment here to all the advisers of the Society who  kindly voted for the speedy culmination of this literary task—a task  which he tenderly wishes would do something towards a better  appreciation by the West of the sources of Eastern life and culture. 
 
Whatever literary work the present author is able to put before the  reader, he cannot pass on without mentioning in it the name of his good,  unselfish, public-minded Buddhist friend, Yakichi Ataka, who is always  willing to help him in every possible way. If not for him, the author  could never have carried out his plans to the extent he has so far  accomplished. Materially, no visible results can be expected of this  kind of undertaking, and yet a scholar has his worldly needs to meet.  Unless we create one of these fine days an ideal community in which  every member of it can put forth all his or her natural endowments and  moral energies in the direction best fitted to develop them and in the  way most useful to all other members generally and individually, many  obstacles are sure to bar the passage of those who would attempt things  of no commercial value. Until then, Bodhisattvas of all kinds are sorely  needed everywhere. And is this not the teaching of the <em>Lankavatara  Sutra</em>, which in its English garb now lies before his friend as well  as all other readers? 
 
Thanks are also due to the writer's wife who went over the whole  manuscript to give it whatever literary improvement it possesses, to Mr  Hokei Idzumi who gave helpful suggestions in the reading of the original  text, and to Professor Yenga Teramoto for his ungrudging cooperation  along the line of Tibetan knowledge.

## INTRODUCTION 
 
</a> 
 
For those who have already read my <em>Studies in the Lankavatara  Sutra</em>_1_, no special words are needed here. But to those  who are not yet quite familiar with the teachings of Mahayana Buddhism  an expository introduction to the principal theses of the <em>Lanka</em> may be welcome. Without something of preliminary knowledge as to what  the Sutra proposes to teach, it will be difficult to comprehend the text  intelligently. For thoughts of deep signification are presented in a  most unsystematic manner. As I said in my <em>Studies</em>, the <em>Lanka</em> is a memorandum kept by a Mahayana master, in which he put down perhaps  all the teachings of importance accepted by the Mahayana followers of  his day. He apparently did not try to give them any order, and it is  possible that the later redactors were not very careful in keeping  faithfully whatever order there was in the beginning, thus giving the  text a still more disorderly appearance. The introduction that follows  may also serve as one to Mahayana Buddhism generally.

### The Classification of Beings 
 
From the Mahayana point of view, beings are divisible into two heads:  those that are enlightened and those that are ignorant. The former are  called Buddhas including also Bodhisattvas, Arhats, and Pratyekabuddhas  while the latter comprise all the rest of beings under the general  designation of bala or balaprithagjana—<em>bala</em> meaning  "undeveloped", "puerile", or "ignorant", and <em>prithagjana</em> "people  different" from the enlightened, that is, the multitudes, or people of  ordinary type, whose minds are found engrossed in the pursuit of  egotistic pleasures and unawakened to the meaning of life. This class is  also known as Sarvasattva, "all beings" or sentient beings. The Buddha  wants to help the ignorant, hence the Buddhist teaching and discipline.

### The Buddha 
 
All the Buddhist teachings unfold themselves around the conception of  Buddhahood. When this is adequately grasped, Buddhist philosophy with  all its complications and superadditions will become luminous. What is  the Buddha? 
 
According to Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva, who is the  interlocutor of the Buddha in the <em>Lanka</em>, the Buddha is endowed  with transcendental knowledge (<em>prajna</em>) and a great compassionate  heart (<em>karuna</em>). With the former he realises that this world of  particulars has no reality, is devoid of an ego-substance (<em>anatman</em>)  and that in this sense it resembles Maya or a visionary flower in the  air. As thus it is above the category of being and non-being, it is  declared to be pure (<em>visuddha</em>) and absolute (<em>vivikta</em>) and  free from conditions (<em>animitta</em>). But the Buddha's transcendental  wisdom is not always abiding in this high altitude, because being  instigated by an irresistible power which innerly pushes him back into a  region of birth and death, he comes down among us and lives with us,  who are ignorant and lost in the darkness of the passions (<em>klesa</em>).  Nirvana is not the ultimate abode of Buddhahood, nor is enlightenment.  Love and compassion is what essentially constitutes the self-nature of  the All-knowing One (<em>sarvajna</em>). 
 
### The Buddha as Love 
 
The Buddha's love is not something ego-centered. It is a will-force  which desires and acts in the realm of twofold egolessness, it is above  the dualism of being and non-being, it rises from a heart of  non-discrimination, it manifests itself in the conduct of  purposelessness (<em>anabhogacarya</em>). It is the Tathagata's great love  (<em>mahakaruna</em>) of all beings, which never ceases until everyone of  them is happily led to the final asylum of Nirvana; for he refuses as  long as there is a single unsaved soul to enjoy the bliss of Samadhi to  which he is entitled by his long spiritual discipline. The Tathagata is  indeed the one who, endowed with a heart of all-embracing love and  compassion, regards all beings as if they were his only child. If he  himself enters into Nirvana, no work will be done in the world where  discrimination (<em>vtkalpa</em>) goes on and multitudinousness (<em>vicitrata</em>)  prevails. For this reason, he refuses to leave this world of  relativity, all his thoughts are directed towards the ignorant and  suffering masses of beings, for whom he is willing to sacrifice his  enjoyment of absolute reality and self-absorption (<em>samadhi-sukhabhutakotya  vinivarya</em>). 
 
### Skilful Means 
 
The essential nature of love is to devise, to create, to accommodate  itself to varying changing circumstances, and to this the Buddha's love  is no exception. He is ever devising for the enlightenment and  emancipation of all sentient beings. This is technically known as the  working of Skilful Means (<em>upayakausalya</em>). Upaya is the outcome of  Prajna and Karuna. When Love worries itself over the destiny of the  ignorant, Wisdom, so to speak, weaves a net of Skilful Means whereby to  catch them up from the depths of the ocean called Birth-and-Death (<em>samsara</em>).  By Upaya thus the oneness of reality wherein the Buddha's enlightened  mind abides transforms itself into the manifoldness of particular  existences. 
 
There is a gem known as Mani which is perfectly transparent and  colourless in itself, and just because of this characteristic it  reflects in it varieties of colours (<em>vicitra-rupa</em>). In the same  way the Buddha is conceived by beings; in the same way his teaching is  interpreted by them; that is, each one recognises the Buddha and his  teaching according to his disposition (<em>asaya</em>), understanding (<em>citta</em>),  prejudice (<em>anusaya</em>), propensity (<em>adhimukti</em>), and  circumstance (<em>gati</em>). Again, the Buddha treats his fellow-beings  as an expert physician treats his patients suffering from various forms  of illness. The ultimate aim is to cure them, but as ailments differ  medicines and treatments cannot be the same. For this reason it is said  that the Buddha speaks one language of enlightenment, which reverberates  in the ears of his hearers in all possible sounds. Upaya may thus be  considered in a way due to the infinite differentiation of individual  characters rather than to the deliberate contrivance of transcendental  wisdom on the part of the Buddha. 
 
### One Buddha with Many Names 
 
All the Buddhas are of one essence, they are the same as far as their  inner enlightenment, their Dharmakaya, and their being furnished with  the thirty-two major and the eighty minor marks of excellence are  concerned. But when they wish to train beings according to their  characters, they assume varieties of forms appearing differently to  different beings, and thus there are many titles and appellations of the  Buddha as to be beyond calculation (<em>asamkhyeya</em>). 
 
One noteworthy fact about this—the Buddha's assuming so many names,  is that he is not only known in various personal names but also given a  number of abstract titles such as No-birth, Emptiness, Suchness,  Reality, Nirvana, Eternity, Sameness, Trueness, Cessation, etc. The  Buddha is thus personal as well as metaphysical. 
 
The <em>Lanka</em> here does not forget to add that though the Buddha  is known by so many different names, he is thereby neither fattened nor  emaciated, as he is like the moon in water neither immersed nor  emerging. This simile is generally regarded as best describing the  relation of unity and multiplicity, of one absolute reality and this  world of names and forms. 
 
### Transformation-bodies of the Buddha 
 
While the Trikaya dogma is not yet fully developed in the <em>Lanka</em>,  each member of the trinity is treaceable in such ideas as  Dharmata-buddha, Vipaka-buddha, and Nirmana-buddha. The notion of the  transformation-body inevitably follows from the Buddha's desire to save  the ignorant whose minds are not enlightened enough to see straightway  into the essence of Buddhahood. As they are not clear-sighted, something  is to be devised to lead them to the right path, and this something  must be in accord with their mentalities. If not, they are sure to go  astray farther and farther. If they are not capable of grasping Buddhata  as it is, let them have something of it and gradually be developed. The  theory of Upaya (skilful means) is also the theory of Manomayakaya,  will-body. As the incarnation of a great compassionate heart, the Buddha  ought to be able to take any form he wishes when he sees the sufferings  of sentient beings. The will-body is a part of the Buddha's plan of  world-salvation. This is one of the reasons why Buddhism is often  regarded as polytheistic and at the same time pantheistic. 
 
### The Bodhisattva and His Ten Vows 
 
In Mahayana Buddhism the Buddha is not the only agent who is engaged  in the work of enlightening or saving the world. While he is able to  transform himself into as many forms as are required by sentient beings,  he is also assisted by his followers or "sons" (<em>putra, suta</em>, or <em>aurasa</em>)  as they are called in the Mahayana sutras. Bodhisattvas are thus the  sons of the Buddha and apply themselves most arduously and most  assiduously to the cause of Buddhism. In fact, the actual work of  world-salvation, we can say, is carried on by these spiritual soldiers  under the leadership of the Buddha. The latter is sometimes felt to be  too remote, too serene, too superhuman, and his sight is often lost in  the midst of our worldly struggles. But the Bodhisattva is always with  us, and ever ready to be our confidant, for he is felt by us to share  the same passions, impulses, and aspirations which are such great  disturbing, though ennobling too, forces of our human life. 
 
To state the truth, sentient beings are all Bodhisattvas, however  ignorant and ready to err they may be. They are all Jinaputras, the sons  of the Victorious, and harbour in themselves every possibility of  attaining enlightenment. The Bodhisattvas who have gone up successively  all the rungs of the Bhumi ladder, and who are thus capable of extending  their help over us, are really our own brethren. Therefore, Mahamati of  the <em>Lanka</em> opens his questions generally with this: "I and other  Bodhisattvas, etc." Mahamati is our mouthpiece voicing our wants and  aspirations. 
 
Thus is not the place to consider historically how the conception  evolved in Buddhism whose primitive object seems to have consisted in  the realisation of Arhatship. But we can state this that the essence of  Bodhisattvahood is an unequivocal affirmation of the social, altruistic  nature of humankind. Whatever enlightenment one gains, it must be shared  by one's fellow-beings. This idea is classically expressed in the  Mahayana by the so-called "Ten Vows of Samantabhadra". The Bodhisattva  is a man of "inexhaustible vows'' (<em>dasanishthapada</em>). Without  these he is not himself. To save the world, to bring all his  fellow-beings up to the same level of thought and feeling where he  himself is, and not to rest, not to enter into Nirvana until this is  accomplished, how infinitely long and how inexpressively arduous the  task may be. This is the Bodhisattva. Vowing to save all beings, which  is technically known as Purva-pranidhana in Mahayana terminology, cannot  even for a moment be separated from the life of the Bodhisattva. 
 
The Buddha being surrounded by these noble-minded sons cannot fail  finally to release all beings from the bondage of karma and ignorance  and thirst for life. With this in view, he is always inspiring the  Bodhisattvas with his sovereign power (<em>prabhava</em>) and sustaining (<em>adhishthana</em>)  them in their efforts to bring enlightenment in the whole triple world. 
 
### The Ignorant 
 
Life as it is lived by most of us is a painful business, for we have  to endure much in various ways. Our desires are thwarted, our wishes are  crushed, and the worst is that we do not know how to get out of this  whirlpool of greed, anger, and infatuation. We are at the extreme end of  existence opposed to that of the Buddha. How can we leap over the abyss  and reach the other shore? 
 
The Mahayana diagnosis of the conditions in which all sentient beings  are placed is that they are all nursed by desire (<em>trishna</em>) as  mother who is Accompanied by pleasure (<em>nandi</em>) and anger (<em>raga</em>),  while ignorance (<em>avidya</em>) is father. To be cured of the disease,  therefore, they must put an end to the continuous activities of this  dualistic poisoning. When this is done, there is a state called  emancipation (<em>vimoksha</em>) which is full of bliss. The Buddhist  question is thus: "How is emancipation possible?" And here rises the  Mahayana system of philosophy. 
 
### The Turning back (paravritti) 
 
To this philosophy, a special paragraph is devoted below. I wish here  to say a few words concerning the important psychological event known  as Paravritti in the <em>Lanka</em> and other Mahayana literature. <em>Paravritti</em> literally means "turning up" or "turning back" or "change";  technically, it is a spiritual change or transformation which takes  place in the mind, especially suddenly, and I have called it "revulsion"  in my <em>Studies in the Lankavatara</em>, which, it will be seen,  somewhat corresponds to what is known as "conversion" among the  psychological students of religion. 
 
It is significant that the Mahayana has been insistent to urge its  followers to experience this psychological transformation in their  practical life. A mere intellectual understanding of the truth is not  enough in the life of a Buddhist; the truth must be directly grasped,  personally experienced, intuitively penetrated into; for then it will be  distilled into life and determine its course. 
 
This Paravritti, according to the <em>Lanka</em>, takes place in the  Alaya-vijnana or All-conserving Mind, which is assumed to exist behind  our individual empirical consciousnesses. The Alaya is a metaphysical  entity, and no psychological analysis can reach it. What we ordinarily  know as the Alaya is its working through a relative mind The Mahayana  calls this phase of the Alaya tainted or defiled (<em>klishta</em>) and  tells us to be cleansed of it in order to experience a Paravritti for  the attainment of ultimate reality. 
 
Paravritti in another sense, therefore, is purification (<em>visuddhi</em>).  In Buddhism terms of colouring are much used, and becoming pure, free  from all pigment, means that the Alaya is thoroughly washed off its  dualistic accretion or outflow (<em>asrava</em>), that is, that the  Tathagata has effected his work of purification in the mind of a  sentient being, which has so far failed to perceive its own oneness and  allness. Being pure is to remain in its own selfhood or self-nature (<em>svabhava</em>).  While Paravritti is psychological, it still retains its intellectual  flavour as most Buddhist terms do. 
 
### Self-discipline and the Buddha's Power 
 
As long as Paravritti is an experience and not mere understanding, it  is evident that self-discipline plays an important role in the Buddhist  life. This is insisted upon in the <em>Lanka</em> as is illustrated in  the use of such phrases as "Do not rely on others" (<em>aparapraneya</em>);  "Strive yourselves" (<em>sikshitavyam</em>), etc. But at the same time we  must not forget the fact that the <em>Lanka</em> also emphasises the  necessity of the Buddha's power being added to the Bodhisattvas, in  their upward course of spiritual development and in the accomplishment  of their great task of world-salvation. If they were not thus so  constantly sustained by the miraculous power of the Buddha, they would  speedily fall into the group of the philosophers and Sravakas, and they  would never be able to attain supreme enlightenment and preach the  doctrine of universal emancipation. Indeed, when the Buddha so wishes,  even such inanimate objects as mountains, woods, palaces, etc. will  resound with the voice of the Buddha; how much more the Bodhisattvas who  are his spiritual inheritors! 
 
The doctrine of Adhishthana gains all the more significance when we  consider the development of Mahayana Buddhism into the doctrine of  salvation by faith alone. The power of a Bodhisattva's original vows may  also be judged as being derived from the Buddha. If the possibility of  enlightenment is due to the Adhishthana or Prabhava of the Buddha, all  the wonders that are to take place by the strength of the enlightenment  must be inferred ultimately to issue from the fountain-head of  Buddhahood itself. 
 
At any rate the Mahayana idea of the Buddha being able to impart his  power to others marks one of those epoch-making deviations which set off  the Mahayana from so-called primitive or original Buddhism. When the  Buddha comes to be considered capable of Adhishthana, the next step his  devotees are logically led to take would be the idea of vicarious  suffering or atonement. Giving power to another is a positive idea while  suffering for another may be said to be a negative one. Though this  latter is strangely absent in the <em>Lanka</em>, the <em>Gandavyuha</em> as  well as the <em>Prajnaparamita</em> are quite eloquent in elucidating the  doctrine of vicarious suffering. According to this doctrine, whatever  suffering one is enduring may be transferred on to another if the latter  sincerely desires out of his unselfish and all-embracing love for  others, to take these sufferings upon himself so that the real sufferers  may not only be relieved of them but escape their evil consequences,  thus enabling him to advance more easily and successfully towards the  attainment of the blissful life. This goes quite against the idea of  individual responsibility. But really religious minds require this  vicarious suffering for their spiritual life. 
 
To suffer or atone vicariously is still negative and fails to  entirely satisfy our spiritual needs. The latter demand that more good  must be done in order to suppress the evils which are found claiming  this world for their own glorification. So the Mahayanists accumulate  stocks of merit not only for the material of their own enlightenment but  for the general cultivation of merit which can be shared equally by  their fellow-beings, animate and inanimate. This is the true meaning of  Parinamana, that is, turning one's merit over to others for their  spiritual interest. 
 
As I said elsewhere, this notion of Parinamana is not at all  traceable in the <em>Lanka</em>, which is strange. The <em>Lanka</em> cannot  be imagined to have been compiled prior to the <em>Prajnaparamita</em>,  nor to the <em>Gandavyuha</em> or <em>Avatamsaka</em>; if so, why this  absence? How can this be explained? 
 
### Buddha the Enlightened and Sarvasattva the Ignorant 
 
To conclude this section, Buddhism is the story of relationship  between the two groups of beings: the one is called Buddha who is the  enlightened, the Tathagata, the Arhat, and the other is generally  designated as Sarvasattva, literally "all beings", who are ignorant,  greedy for worldly things, and therefore in perpetual torment. In spite  of their hankering for worldly enjoyments, they are conscious of their  condition and not at all satisfied with it; when they reflect they find  themselves quite forlorn inwardly, they long for real happiness, for  ultimate reality, and blissful enlightenment. They look upwards, where  the Buddha sits rapt in his meditation serenely regarding them with his  transcendental wisdom. As he looks down at his fellow-beings  inexplicably tormented with their greed and ignorance and egotism, he is  disturbed, for he feels an inextinguishable feeling of love stirring  within himself—the feeling now perfectly purified of all the defilements  of selfishness, which embraces the whole world in pity though not  attached to it. The Buddha leaves his transcendental abode. He is seen  among sentient beings, each one of whom recognises him according to his  own light. 
 
Transcendental wisdom <em>(prajna)</em> and a heart of all-embracing  love <em>(mahakaruna)</em> constitute the very reason of Buddhahood, while  the desire or thirst for life (<em>trishna</em>), and ignorance as to the  meaning of life (<em>avidya</em>), and deeds (<em>karma</em>) following  from the blind assertion of life-impulse— these are the factors that  enter into the nature of Sarvasattva, all ignorant and infatuated ones.  The one who is above, looking downward, extends his arms to help; the  other unable to extricate himself from entanglements looks up in  despair, and finding the helping arms stretches his own to take hold of  them. And from this scene the following narratives psychological,  logical, and ontological, unfold themselves to the Buddhist soul. 
 
### II 
 
### Psychology 
 
What may be termed Buddhist psychology in the <em>Lanka</em> consists  in the analysis of mind, that is, in the classification of the Vijnanas.  To understand thus the psychology of Buddhism properly the knowledge of  these terms is necessary: <em>citta, manas, vijnana, manovijnana</em>,  and <em>alayavijnana</em>. 
 
To begin with Vijnana. <em>Vijnana</em> is composed of the prefix <em>vi</em>,  meaning "to divide", and the root <em>jna</em> which means "to perceive",  "to know". Thus, Vijnana is the faculty of distinguishing or discerning  or judging. When an object is presented before the eye, it is perceived  and judged as a red apple or a piece of white linen; the faculty of  doing this is called eye-vijnana. In the same way, there are ear-vijnana  for sound, nose-vijnana for odour, tongue-vijnana for taste,  body-vijnana for touch, and thought-vijnana (<em>manovijnana</em>) for  ideas—altogether six forms of Vijnana for distinguishing the various  aspects of world external or internal. 
 
Of these six Vijnanas, the Manojivnana is the most important as it is  directly related to an inner faculty known as Manas. Manas roughly  corresponds to mind as an organ of thought, but in fact it is more than  that, for it is also a strong power of attaching itself to the result of  thinking. The latter may even be considered subordinate to this power  of attachment. The Manas first wills, then it discriminates to judge; to  judge is to divide, and this dividing ends in viewing existence  dualistically. Hence the Manas' tenacious attachment to the dualistic  interpretation of existence. Willing and thinking are inextricably woven  into the texture of Manas. 
 
<em>Citta</em> comes from the root <em>cit</em>, "to think", but in the <em>Lanka</em> the derivation is made from the root <em>ci</em>, "to pile up", "to  arrange in order". The Citta is thus a storehouse where the seeds of all  thoughts and deeds are accumulated and stored up. The Citta, however,  has a double sense, general and specific. When it is used in the general  sense it means "mind", "mentation", "ideas", including the activities  of Manas and Manovijnana, and also of the Vijnanas; while specifically  it is a synonym of Alayavijnana in its relative aspects, and  distinguishable from all the rest of the mental faculties. When,  however, it is used in the form of Citta-matra, Mind-only, it acquires  still another connotation. We can say that Citta appears here in its  highest possible sense, for it is then neither simply mentation nor  intellection, nor perception as a function of consciousness. It is  identifiable with the Alaya in its absolute aspect. This will become  clearer later on. 
 
<em>Alayavijnana</em> is <em>alaya</em>+<em>vijnana</em>, and <em>alaya</em> is a store where things are hoarded for future use. The Citta as a  cumulative faculty is thus identified with the Alayavijnana. Strictly  speaking, the Alaya is not a Vijnana, has no discerning power in it; it  indiscriminately harbours all that is poured into it through the channel  of the Vijnanas. The Alaya is perfectly neutral, indifferent, and does  not offer to give judgments. 
 
### Relation Between the Various Functions 
 
Having explained what the various important terms mean and what  functions are indicated by them, let us proceed to see in what  relationship they stand to one another. The whole system of mental  functions is called in the <em>Lanka</em> Cittakalapa or Vijnanakaya;  Citta and Vijnana are here used synonymously. In this mental system  eight modes of activity are distinguished: Alayavijnana, Manas,  Manovijnana, and the five sense-Vijnanas. When these eight Vijnanas are  grouped together under two general heads, the one group is known as  Khyati-Vijnana (perceiving Vijnanas) and the other as  Vastuprativikalpa-vijnana (object-discriminating Vijnana). But in fact  the Vijnanas are not separable into these two groups, for perceiving is  discriminating. When an individual object is perceived as such, that is,  as solid, or as coloured, etc., discrimination has already taken place  here; indeed without the latter, the former is impossible and  conversely. Every Vijnana performs these two functions simultaneously,  which is to say, one functioning is analysable into two ideas,  perceiving and discriminating. But it is to be observed that this double  activity does not belong to the Alayavijnana. 
 
Another way of classifying the Vijnanas is according to their  Lakshana or modes of being, of which three are distinguishable as  evolving (<em>pravritti</em>), as performing deeds (<em>karma</em>), and as  retaining their own original nature (<em>jati</em>). From this viewpoint,  all the Vijnanas are evolving and deed-performing Vijnanas except the  Alaya which always abides in its self-nature. For the Vijnanas may cease  from evolving and performing deeds for some reason, but the Alaya ever  remains itself. 
 
The Alaya, according to the <em>Lanka</em>, has two aspects: the Alaya  as it is in itself, which is in the Sagathakam called  Paramalaya-vijnana, and the Alaya as mental representation called  Vijnaptir Alaya. These two aspects are also known respectively as the  Prabandha (incessant) and the Lakshana (manifested). The Alaya is  incessant because of its uninterrupted existence; it is manifested  because of its activity being perceptible by the mind. 
 
From this, we can see that the Alaya is conceived in the <em>Lanka</em> as being absolute in one respect and in the other as being subject to  "evolution" (<em>pravritti</em>). It is this evolving aspect of the Alaya  that lends itself to the treacherous interpretation of Manas. As long as  the Alaya remains in and by itself, it is beyond the grasp of an  individual, empirical consciousness, it is almost like Emptiness itself  although it ever lies behind all the Vijnana-activities, for the latter  will cease working at once when the Alaya is taken out of existence. 
 
Manas is conscious of the presence behind itself of the Alaya and  also of the latter's uninterrupted working on the entire system of the  Vijnanas. Reflecting on the Alaya and imagining it to be an ego, Manas  clings to it as if it were reality and disposes of the reports of the  six Vijnanas accordingly. In other words, Manas is the individual will  to live and the principle of discrimination. The notion of an  ego-substance is herein established, and also the acceptance of a world  external to itself and distinct from itself. 
 
The six Vijnanas function, as it were, mechanically when the  conditions are satisfied and are not conscious of their own doings. They  have no intelligence outside their respective fields of activity. They  are not organised in themselves and have no theory for their existence  and Doings. What they experience is reported to the headquarters with no  comment or interpretation. Manas sits at the headquarters and like a  great general gathers up all the information coming from the six  Vijnanas. - For it is he who shifts and arranges the reports and gives  orders again to the reporters according to his own will and  intelligence. The orders are then faithfully executed. 
 
The Manas is a double-headed monster, the one face looks towards the  Alaya and the other towards the Vijnanas. He does not understand what  the Alaya really is. Discrimination being one of his fundamental  functions, he sees multitudinousness there and clings to it as final.  The clinging now binds him to a world of particulars. Thus, desire is  mother, and ignorance is father, and this existence takes its rise. But  the Manas is also a double-edged sword. When there takes place a  "turning-back" (<em>paravritti</em>) in it, the entire arrangement of  things in the Vijnanakaya or Citta-kalapa changes. With one swing of the  sword the pluralities are cut asunder and the Alaya is seen in its  native form (<em>svalakshana</em>), that is, as solitary reality (<em>viviktadharma</em>),  which is from the first beyond discrimination. The Manas is not of  course an independent worker, it is always depending on the Alaya,  without which it has no reason of being itself; but at the same time the  Alaya is also depending on the Manas. The Alaya is absolutely one, but  this oneness gains significance only when it is realised by the Manas  and recognised as its own supporter (<em>alamba</em>). This relationship  is altogether too subtle to be perceived by ordinary minds that are  found choked with defilements and false ideas since beginningless time. 
 
The Manas backed by the Alaya has been the seat of desire or thirst (<em>trishna</em>),  karma, and ignorance. The seeds grow out of them, and are deposited in  the Alaya. When the waves are stirred up in the Alaya-ocean by the wind  of objectivity—so interpreted by the Manas—these seeds give a constant  supply to the uninterrupted flow of the Vijnana-waters. In this general  turmoil in which we sentient beings are all living, the Alaya is as  responsible as the Manas; for if the Alaya refused to take the seeds in  that are sent up from the region of the Vijnana, Manas may not have  opportunities to exercise its two fundamental functions, willing and  discriminating. But at the same time it is due to the Alaya's  self-purifying nature that there takes place a great catastrophe in it  known as "turning-back". With this "turning-back" in the Alaya, Manas so  intimately in relation with it also experiences a transformation in its  fundamental attitude towards the Vijnanas. The latter are no more  regarded as reporters of an external world which is characterised with  individuality and manifoldness. This position is now abandoned, the  external world is no more adhered to as such, that is, as reality; for  it is no more than a mere reflection of the Alaya. The Alaya has been  looking at itself in the Manas' mirror. There has been from the very  first nothing other than itself. Hence the doctrine of Mind-only (<em>cittamatra</em>),  or the Alaya-only. 
 
### The Religious Signification 
 
The necessity of conceiving Alaya in its double aspect, (1) as  absolute reality (<em>viviktadharma</em>) and (2) as subject to causation (<em>hetuka</em>),  comes from the Mahayana idea of Buddhahood (<em>buddhata</em>). If  Buddhahood is something absolutely solitary, all the efforts put forward  by sentient beings to realise enlightenment would be of no avail  whatever. In other words, all that the Tathagata wants to do for  sentient beings would never have its opportunity to reach them. There  must be something commonly shared by each so that when a note is struck  at one end a corresponding one will answer at the other. The Alaya is  thus known on the one hand as Tathagata-garbha, the womb of  Tathagatahood, and on the other hand imagined by the ignorant as an  ego-soul (<em>pudgala</em> or <em>atman</em>). 
 
The Tathagata-garbha, therefore, whose psychological name is  Alayavijnana, is a reservoir of things good and bad, pure and defiled.  Expressed differently, the Tathagata-garbha is originally, in its  self-nature, immaculate, but because of its external dirt (<em>agantuklesa</em>)  it is soiled, and when soiled—which is the state generally found in all  sentient beings—an intuitive penetration (<em>pratyaksha</em>) is  impossible. When this is impossible as is the case with the philosophers  and ignorant masses, the Garbha is believed sometimes to be a creator (<em>karana</em>)  and sometimes to be an ego-substance (<em>atman</em>). As it is so  believed, it allows itself to transmigrate through the six paths of  existence. Let there be, however, an intuitive penetration into the  primitive purity (<em>prakritipurisuddhi</em>) of the Tathagata-garbha,  and the whole system of the Vijnanas goes through a revolution. If the  Tathagata-garbha or Alaya-vijnana were not a mysterious mixture of  purity and defilement, good and evil, this abrupt transformation (<em>paravritti</em>)  of an entire personality would be an impossibility. That is to say, if  the Garbha or the Alaya while absolutely neutral and colourless in  itself did not yet harbour in itself a certain irrationality, no  sentient beings would ever be a Buddha, no enlightenment would be  experienced by any human beings. Logicalness is to be transcended  somewhere and somehow. And as this illogical-ness is practically  possible, the Mahayana establishes the theory of Mind-only (<em>cittamatra</em>). 
 
### Ontology and the Twofold Egolessness 
 
In considering the theory of Mind-only, we have to be careful not to  understand this term psychologically. Mind (<em>citta</em>) here does not  mean our individual mind which is subject to the law of causation (<em>hetupratyaya</em>).  Absolute Citta transcends the dualistic conception of existence, it  belongs neither to the Vijnana-system nor to our objective world (<em>vishaya</em>).  Therefore, in the <em>Lanka</em> this Citta is frequently described in  ontological terms. 
 
The most significant one is Vastu, which is found coupled with  Tathata in one place (p. 147, line 6)) and with Arya in another place  (p. 164, lines 9 and 10). In the first case, Vastu and Tathata are  synonymously used; what is Tathata, that is Vastu. Tathata is to be  rendered either "suchness", or "thatness", which is a term most  frequently used in the Mahayana texts to designate the highest reality  ever approachable by Prajna, transcendental wisdom; Vastu in Buddhism is  usually an individual object regarded as existing externally to the  Vijnanas, and so is it in most cases in the <em>Lanka</em> also. But  evidently in this connection where Vastu is Tathata, it must mean the  highest reality. 
 
In the second case in which Arya is affixed to Vastu, the <em>arya</em> must be a modifier here, that is, this reality is something to be  described as <em>arya</em>, "noble", "holy", or "worthy". 
 
The highest reality is also called "something that has been in  existence since the very first" (<em>purvadharmasthitita</em>, p. 241, 1.  14), or (<em>pauranasthitidharmata</em>, p. 143, ll. 5 and 9). As it is  the most ancient reality, its realisation means returning to one's own  original abode in which everything one sees around is an old familiar  object. In Zen Buddhism, therefore, the experience is compared to the  visiting one's native home and quietly getting settled (歸家穩坐, <em>kuei-chia wen-tso</em>). The Buddhas,  enlightened ones, are all abiding here as gold is embedded in the mine.  The ever-enduring reality (<em>sthitita dharmata</em>) is above changes. 
 
To be above changes means to remain in one's own abode, not to move  away from it, and for this reason reality is known as "self-abiding" (<em>svastha</em>,  p. 199, line 4), or "remaining in its own abode" (<em>svasthane  'vatishthate</em>, p. 178, 1. 15)._1_ To keep one's own abode it  to be single, solitary, absolute: hence Reality is Viviktadharma, a  thing of solitude; <em>Bhutakoti</em>, limit of reality, which points to a  similar mode of thinking. It is again Ekagra, the summit of oneness,  and this summit or limit (<em>koti</em>) is at the same time no-summit,  no-limit, because this is gained only when one makes a final leap beyond  the manifoldness of things. 
 
_1_ Cf. p. 124, line 1. 
 
The more ordinary expressions given to the highest reality known as  Citta are Tathata, "suchness" or "thusness", Satyata, "the state of  being true", Bhutata, "the state of being real", Dharmadhatu, "realm of  truth", Nirvana, the Permanent (<em>nitya</em>), Sameness (<em>samata</em>),  the One (<em>advaya</em>), Cessation (<em>nirodha</em>), the Formless (<em>animitta</em>),  Emptiness (<em>sunyata</em>), etc. 
 
From these descriptions it is found natural for Mahayanists  psychologically to deny the existence of an ego-soul or ego-substance in  the Alaya, and ontologically to insist that the tragedy of life comes  from believing in the substantiality or finality of an individual  object. The former is technically called the doctrine of  Pudgalanairatmya, egolessness of persons,_1_ and the latter  that of Dharmanairatmya, egolessness of things; the one denies the  reality of an ego-soul and the other the ultimacy of an individual  object. 
 
Superficially, this denial of an Atman in persons and individual  objects sounds negative and productive of no moral signification. But  when one understands what is ultimately meant by Cittamatra (Mind-only)  or by Vivikta-dharma (the Solitary), the negations are on the plane of  relativity and intellection. 
 
The term "the Middle" (<em>madhyama</em>), meaning "the Middle Way'',  does not occur in the <em>Lanka</em> proper except in its Sagathakam  portion. But the idea that the truth is not found in the dualistic way  of interpreting existence, that it is beyond the category of being and  non-being, is everywhere emphasised in the <em>Lanka</em>. In fact, we can  say that one of the principal theses of the <em>Lanka</em> is to  establish the Absolute which makes a world of particulars possible but  which is not to be grasped by means of being and non-being (<em>astina-stitva</em>).  This Absolute is the Middle Way of the Madhyamaka school. 
 
_1_ The conception of the Tathagata-garbha is not to be  confused with that of a Pudgala or Atman. See xxviii. For the  non-existence of a personal ego-soul and the non-reality of an  individual object, see especially pp. 01-62 of this translation. 
 
### Unobtainability 
 
This going beyond all forms of dualism, however differently it may be  expressed, whether as being and non-being, or as oneness and manyness,  or as this and that, or as causation and no-causation, or as form and  no-form, or as assertion and negation, or as Samsara and Nirvana, or as  ignorance and knowledge, or as work and no-work, or as good and evil, or  as purity and defilement, or as ego and non-ego, or as worldly and  super-worldly, <em>ad infinitum</em> —this going beyond a world of  oppositions and contrasts constitutes one of the most significant  thoughts of the Mahayana. There is nothing real as long as we remain  entangled in the skein of relativity, and our sufferings will never come  to an end. We must therefore endeavour to take hold of reality, but  this reality is not something altogether solitary. For in this case no  one of us will be able to have even a glimpse of it, and if we had, it  will turn into something standing in opposition to this world of  relativity, which means the loss of solitariness, that is, the solitary  now forms part of this world. 
 
Thus, according to Buddhist philosophy, reality must be grasped in  this world and by this world, for it is that "Beyond which is also  Within". The <em>Lanka</em> compares it to the moon in water or a flower  in a mirror. It is within and yet outside, it is outside and yet within.  This aspect of reality is described as "unobtainable" or "unattainable"  (<em>anupalabdha</em>). And just because it is unobtainable in a world of  particulars, the latter from the point of view of reality is like a  dream, like a mirage, and so on. The subtlest relation of reality to the  world is beyond description, it yields its secrets only to him who has  actually realised it in himself by means of noble wisdom (<em>aryajnana</em> or <em>prajna</em>). This realisation is also a kind of knowledge though  different from what is generally known by this name. 
 
### Epistemology 
 
Without a theory of cognition, therefore, Mahayana philosophy becomes  incomprehensible. The <em>Lanka</em> is quite explicit in assuming two  forms of knowledge: the one for grasping the absolute or entering into  the realm of Mind-only, and the other for understanding existence in its  dualistic aspect in which logic prevails and the Vijnanas are active.  The latter is designated Discrimination (<em>vikalpa</em>) in the <em>Lanka</em> and the former transcendental wisdom or knowledge (<em>prajna</em>). To  distinguish these two forms of knowledge is most essential in Buddhist  philosophy. 
 
The <em>Lanka</em> is decidedly partial to the use of Aryajnana instead  of Prajna, although the latter has been in use since the early days of  Buddhism. Aryajnana, noble wisdom, is generally coupled with Pratyatma,  inner self, showing that this noble, supreme wisdom is a mental function  operating in the depths of our being. As it is concerned with the  highest reality or the ultimate truth of things, it is no superficial  knowledge dealing with particular objects and their relations. It is an  intuitive understanding which, penetrating through the surface of  existence, sees into that which is the reason of everything logically  and ontologically. 
 
The <em>Lanka</em> is never tired of impressing upon its readers the  importance of this understanding in the attainment of spiritual freedom;  for this understanding is a fundamental intuition into the truth of  Mind-only and constitutes the Buddhist enlightenment with which truly  starts the religious life of a Bodhisattva. 
 
This transcendental Jnana is variously designated in the <em>Lanka</em>.  It is Pravicayabuddhi, that is, an insight fixed upon the ultimate  ground of existence. It is Svabuddhi, innate in oneself; Nirabhasa, or  Anabhasa (imagelessness), beyond all forms of tangibility; Nirvikalpa,  beyond discrimination, meaning direct empirical knowledge before  analysis starts in any form whatever; which therefore is not at all  expressible by means of words (<em>vac</em> or <em>ruta</em>). The awaking  of supreme knowledge (<em>anuttarasamyaksambodhi</em>) is the theme of the  <em>Prajnaparnmita-sutras</em>, but in the <em>Lanka</em> the weight of the  discourse is placed upon the realisation by means of Aryajnana of  ultimate reality which is Mind-only. This psychological emphasis so  distinctive of the <em>Lanka</em> makes this sutra occupy a unique  position in Mahayana literature. 
 
The knowledge that stands contrasted to Prajna or Aryajnana is  Vikalpabuddhi, or simply Vikalpa, which I have translated  "discrimination". It is relative knowledge working on the plane of  dualism, it may be called the principle of dichotomy, whereby judgment  is made possible. By us existence is always divided into pairs of  conception, thesis and antithesis, that is, being and non-being,  permanent and impermanent, Nirvana and Samsara, birth and death,  creating and created, this and that, Me and not-Me, <em>ad libitum</em>.  This is due to the working of Vikalpa. The Lakshana (form) of existence  thus presented to us is not its real nature, it is our own  thought-construction (<em>vijnapti</em>); but our Buddhi which seeks after  pluralities fails to understand this fact and makes us cling to  appearances as realities. As the result, the world in which we now find  ourselves living ceases to be what it is in itself; for it is one we  have constructed according to our own ignorance and discrimination.  Reality escapes us, truth slips off our grasp, false views accumulate,  wrong judgments go on adding complexities upon complexities. The  habit-energy (<em>vasana</em>) thus created takes complete hold on the  Alayavijnana, and Alaya the Absolute is forever unable to extricate  itself from these encumbrances. Eternal transmigration to no purpose  must be our destiny. 
 
### The Twofold Truth (satya) 
 
The distinction between the highest truth (<em>paramartha-satya</em>)  and conventional truth (<em>samvriti-satya</em>) is not explicitly held in  the <em>Lanka</em>, but allusions are occasionally made to them; and it  is said that false discrimination belongs to conventionalism (p. 131, 1.  3). Another word for conventionalism is Vyavahara, worldly experience,  according to which we talk of things being born and destroyed, and also  of the how, what, where, etc. of existence. This kind of knowledge does  not help us to have an insight into the depths of being. 
 
### The Three Svabhavas 
 
Another way of classifying knowledge is known as three Svabhavas in  the <em>Lanka</em>. This is a generally recognised classification in all  the schools of Mahayana Buddhism. <em>Svabhava</em> means "self-nature" or  "self-reality" or "self-substance '', the existence of which in some  form is popularly accepted. The first form of knowledge by which the  reality of things is assumed is called Parikalpita, "imagined", that is,  imagination in its ordinary sense. This is an illusion, for things are  imagined to exist really where in fact there are none. It is like seeing  a mirage which vanishes as one approaches. Imagined (<em>parikalpita</em>)  objects have, therefore, no objective reality. 
 
The second form of knowledge by which we examine existence is  Paratantra, "depending upon another". This is a kind of scientific  knowledge based on analysis. Buddhists make use of this knowledge to  disprove the substantiality of individual objects, that is, the <em>svabhavatva</em> of things. According to them, there is nothing self-existing in the  world, everything is depending for its existence on something else,  things are universally mutually conditioned, endlessly related to one  another. Dissect an object considered final, and it dissolves itself  into airy nothingness. Modern scientists declare that existence is no  more than mathematical formulae. The Mahayanists would say that there is  no Svabhava in anything appealing as such to the Vijnanas when it is  examined from the Paratantra point of view. 
 
The imagined view (<em>parikalpita</em>) of reality does not give us a  true knowledge of it, and the relativity view (<em>paratantra</em>)  reduces it into nothingness: if so, where does our boat of enlightenment  get anchored? The <em>Lanka</em> tells us that there is a third way of  viewing existence, called Parinishpanna, "perfected", which allows us to  become truly acquainted with reality as it is. It is this "perfected"  knowledge whereby we are enabled to see really into the nature of  existence, to perceive rightly what is meant by Svabhava, and to declare  that there is no Svabhava as is imagined by the ignorant and that all  is empty (<em>sunya</em>). 
 
Perfect or "perfected" knowledge issues from Prajna, or Aryajnana, or  sometimes simply Jnana, seeing into the suchness of things. It  perceives things as they are, because going beyond the realm of being  and non-being which belongs to discrimination, the principle of  dichotomisation, it dives into the abyss where there are no shadows (<em>anabhasa</em>).  This is called self-realisation (<em>svasiddhi</em>). So states the <em>Lanka</em> that as the wise see reality with their eye of Prajna, they ascertain  definitely what it is, i. e. in its self-nature (<em>bhavasvabhava</em>)  and not as is seen by the ignorant whose eye is never raised beyond the  horizon of relativity. 
 
This is again called seeing into the emptiness of things. Emptiness (<em>sunyata</em>),  however, does not mean "relativity", as is thought by some scholars.  Relativity-emptiness is on the lower plane of knowledge and does not  reveal the real view of existence as it is. Emptiness taught in the  Mahayana texts goes far deeper into the matter. It is the object of  transcendental knowledge. As long as one stays in the world of  relativity where logic rules supreme, one cannot have even the remotest  idea of true emptiness or what is designated in the <em>Prajnaparamita</em> as Mahasunyata. The <em>Lanka</em> has also this kind of Sunyata  mentioned as one of the seven Emptinesses (p. 94). Relativity-emptiness  so called corresponds to the first of the seven Emptinesses, while the  Mahayana Sunyata is Paramartha-aryajnana-mahasunyata, that is, the great  void of noble wisdom which is the highest reality. 
 
### The Five Dharmas 
 
Before concluding this section, we must not forget to mention what is  known as the Five Dharmas in the <em>Lanka</em> making up one of the main  topics of discourses. The Five Dharmas and the Three Svabhavas are  different ways of classifying the same material. The Five are:  Appearances (<em>nimitta</em>), Names (<em>nama</em>), Discrimination (<em>samkalpa</em>),  Right Knowledge (<em>samyagjnana</em>), and Suchness (<em>tathata</em>).  The first three correspond to the two of the Three Svabhavas,  Parikalpita and Paratantra, while the last two belong to the  Parinishpanna. 
 
Our relative knowledge starts with perceiving Appearances to which  Names are given. Names are then thought real and discrimination is  carried on. We can say that discrimination has been with us from the  first even when what is called perception has not taken place. For  naming is impossible without some form of discrimination. Then the worst  thing comes upon us as we begin to persuade ourselves and think that by  giving Names existence has been successfully disposed of, and feel  comfortable about the problems of religion. Although without naming no  knowledge is possible, Right Knowledge (<em>samyagjnana</em>) is not to be  had here. For this is the inexpressible, the unnamable, it is the  meaning (<em>artha</em>) not to be grasped by words. In this the <em>Lanka</em> permits no equivocation, it most emphatically advises us not to attach  ourselves to words. 
 
The object of Right Knowledge is Suchness of things as not  conditioned by the category of being and non-being. It is in this sense  that ultimate reality is said to be like the moon in the water, it is  not immersed in it, nor is it outside it. We cannot say that the moon is  in water, for it is a mere reflection; but we cannot say that it is not  there, for a reflection though it may be it is really before us.  Plurality of objects is not real from the point of view of relativity as  well as from the point of view of Suchness. If some one declares such  reality as maintained by the Mahayana is too ethereal, too phantom-like,  too unreal for our religious aspirations, the <em>Lanka</em> will  immediately retort, "You are still on the plane of relativity." When the  Aryajnana is awakened, Tathata is the most real thing and a term most  fittingly applied as far as our power of designation is concerned. 
 
### III 
 
### The Message of the Lanka 
 
There are many other thoughts of interest in the <em>Lanka</em> which  may be discussed in this Introduction. But as I have already given up  many pages to it and as the reader who wishes to know more about the  Sutra may go to my <em>Studies in the Lankavatara</em>, I will say just a  few words about the position of this Sutra among the general Mahayana  Buddhist texts. 
 
While we are still in the dark as to how Mahayana Buddhism developed  in India, we know that when it was introduced into China by the  missionaries from India and central Asia, it was already regarded as  directly coming from the Buddha's own golden mouth, and that what must  have developed during several hundred years after his death was taken in  a wholesale manner for a system fully matured in his life-time  extending over a period of about half a century after his Enlightenment.  As the sutras were translated into Chinese, the first of which appeared  in 68 a. d., they profoundly stirred the Chinese and then the Japanese  mind awakening their religious consciousness to its very depths. The  following are the most important Mahayana texts that thus served to move  the religious feelings of the Far-eastern peoples and are still  continuing to do so. 
 
(1) <em>The Saddharma-pundarika-sutra</em>. One of the main theses of  this inspiring scripture is the announcement that the Buddha never died,  that he is forever living on the Mount of the Holy Vulture and  preaching to a group of the Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and Bodhisattvas,  who are no less beings than ourselves, and that the Buddha has just one  vehicle (<em>yana</em>) for all beings. This must have been a  revolutionary teaching at the time when the Buddha was thought to be  just as transient and mortal as ourselves, and when the only thing that  was left behind after his Nirvana was his Dharma, in which his followers  were asked to find their Master. 
 
(2) <em>The Avalokitesvara-vikurvana-nirdesa</em>. This is commonly  known as <em>Kwannon-gyo</em> in Japan and forms the twenty-fourth chapter  of the Sanskrit <em>Saddharma-pundarika</em>, but it will be better to  treat it as a separate document as it has quite an independent message  and has been so considered though not always consciously by its  devotees. Avalokitesvara is here represented as a god of mercy who will  help anybody who finds himself in trouble spiritually as well as  materially. In popular minds the god is no more masculine than feminine;  if anything, more feminine, because of mercy being more reality  associated with eternal femininity. That he can assume various forms (<em>vikurvana</em>)  in order to achieve his ends appeals very much to the religious  imagination of the Eastern peoples. And this doctrine of transformation  is one of the characteristic features of Mahayana Buddhism. 
 
(3) <em>The Avatamsaka-sutra</em>. This is an encyclopedic sutra of  which we find the <em>Gandavyuha</em> and the <em>Desabhumika</em> forming a  part. It is another Mahayana sutra that has influenced the Chinese and  the Japanese mind profoundly. The so-called Interpenetration which  constitutes the central thought of the sutra is symbolically and  effectively treated in the Chinese translations by Buddhabhadra (60  fas.), by Sikshananda (80 fas.), and by Prajna (40 fas.). The sutra as  we have it now contains many sutras which may be considered independent  though they no doubt belong to the same class of literature. The reading  may be tedious from the modern point of view as the main theme is not  so succinctly presented, and it takes some time before the reader can  get into the mood of the sutra itself. After a quiet and patient pursuit  of the text, however, he cannot help but be deeply impressed with its  underlying spirit whose grandeur of outlook almost surpasses human  comprehension. The huge rock-cut figure of Vairocana at Lung-men and the  bronze figure in Nara are respectively the Chinese and the Japanese  artistic response to the spiritual stimulation caused by the <em>Avatamsaka</em>,  or the <em>Gandavyuha</em> which is the same thing. 
 
Another profound effect produced by this sutra on the Eastern mind is  the conception of the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra with his "ten  inexhaustible vows." He would not enter into Nirvana, that coveted  object of all the Buddhists, because he would not have one single soul  unsaved behind him. And by this "soul" was meant not only human soul but  the soul of every being animate or inanimate. It was the vow of  Samantabhadra to release animals, plants, and even such inanimate  existences as mountains, waters, earths, etc., from the bondage of  ignorance and karma. His universe, moreover, was far wider and more  spiritualistic than our ordinary one 
 
(4) <em>The Prajna-paramita-sutra</em>. This is regarded by most  Mahayana scholars to have been one of the first Mahayana literature that  was declared against the hair-splitting scholastic philosophy of early  Buddhist doctors, gives us the doctrine of Emptiness or Void (<em>sunyata</em>),  whereby every possible straw of attachment is taken away from us. To be  left alone in the Void, even with this Void vanishing from around us,  is the method of perfect emancipation proposed by the <em>Prajna-paramita</em>.  This was quite a direct straightforward proposition on the part of the  Mahayanist. It appealed greatly to intellectual minds as well as the  mystical. While the <em>Avatamsaka</em> filled the universe with things of  imagination even to its minutest particle, the <em>Prajna-paramita</em> swept everything away from the universe which now becomes a vast Void  indeed. And in six hundred fascicles of the sutra we are warned not to  be afraid of, not to be taken aback by this vast Void. If we stagger at  this gospel of absolute Emptiness, we are told by the Buddha that we  cannot be good followers of the Mahayana. 
 
(5) <em>The Vimalakirti-sutra</em>. This is a masterpiece, a drama with  great literary merit, and because of this fact it is read more  generally than other Buddhist sutras by the laity. The signification of  this sutra lies in taking our soiled coat of attachment off our back  which we have been wearing ever since we became aware of an external  existence. Another significant feature of the sutra is that its chief  figure of interest is not the Buddha but a wealthy layman called  Vimalakirti. It is this crafty old gentleman-philosopher who puts to  shame all the Sravakas and Bodhisattvas coming to argue with him about  the deepest truths of Buddhism, except Manjusri, the head of the  Bodhisattvas. The latter proved a good match for the eloquence of the  lay-disciple of the Buddha. What we have to notice especially in this  Mahayana text is that Buddhism does not require us to lead a homeless  life as a Bhikshu in order to attain enlightenment, that is, the  householder's life is as good and pure as the mendicant's. 
 
(6) In this respect the <em>Srimala-sutra</em> is also significant, for  Srimala the queen inspired by the wisdom and power of the Buddha  delivers a great sermon on the Tathagata-garbha. The Mahayana may be  said to be the revolt of laymen and laywomen against the ascetic spirit  of exclusion pervading among early advocates of Buddhism. 
 
(7) <em>The Sukhavati-vyuha-sutra</em>. The influence of this sutra on  Oriental people is quite different from that of the other sutras, for it  has awakened the faith-aspect of their religious consciousness, which  is established on the general basis of Mahayana philosophy.  Superficially, the faith of Amitabha looks very much like Christian  faith in Christ, but the underlying thoughts are not at all the same.  The Jodo school could not take its rise from any other soil than  Mahayana Buddhism. In Japan this school has achieved a unique  development marking a spiritual epoch in the history of religious faith  in the East. 
 
(8) <em>The Parinirvana-sutra</em>. This once formed the foundation of  the Nirvana school in the early history of Chinese Buddhism. Its main  assertion is that the Buddha-nature is present in every one of us.  Before the arrival of this sutra in China it was generally believed that  there was a class of people known as Icchanti who had no Buddha-nature  in them and therefore who were eternally barred from attaining  enlightenment. This belief was entirely expelled, however, when a  statement to the contrary was found in the sutra, saying that "There is  something in all beings which is true, real, eternal, self-governing,  and forever unchanging—this is called Ego, though quite different from  what is generally known as such by the philosophers. This Ego is the  Tathagata-garbha, Buddha-nature, which exists in every one of us, and is  characterised with such virtues as permanency, bliss, freedom, and  purity." 
 
(9) All these and other sutras of Mahayana Buddhism may seem to  exhaust the many-sided aspects of this school, but another is needed to  tell us that mere understanding is not enough in the Buddhist life, that  without self-realisation all intellection amounts to nothing. To tell  us this is the office of the <em>Lankavatara-sutra</em>, and Bodhidharma,  father of Zen Buddhism, made use of the text quite effectively; for it  was through him that a special school of Buddhism under the title of Zen  or Ch'an has come to develop in China and in Japan. While Zen as we  have it now is not the same in many respects as Bodhidharma first  proclaimed it about fifteen centuries ago, the spirit itself flows quite  unchanged in the East. And this is eloquently embodied in the <em>Lankavatara-sutra</em>.  It is not, however, necessary here for us to enter into details, for  the point has been fully dwelt upon in my recent work, <em>Studies in the  Lankavatara Sutra</em>. Suffice it to touch lightly upon the  characteristic features of the Sutra, which constitute its special  message as distinguished from the other sutras already referred to. 
 
There is no doubt that the <em>Lanka</em> is closely connected in time  as well as in doctrine with <em>The Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana</em> generally ascribed to Asvaghosha. While he may not have been the author  of this most important treatise of Mahayana philosophy, there was  surely a great Buddhist mind, who, inspired by the same spirit which  pervades the <em>Lanka</em>, the <em>Avatamsaka</em>, the <em>Parinirvana</em>,  etc., poured out his thoughts in <em>The Awakening</em>. Some scholars  contend that <em>The Awakening</em> is a Chinese work, but this is not  well grounded. 
 
In a way <em>The Awakening</em> is an attempt to systematise the <em>Lanka</em>,  for all the principal teachings of the latter are found there developed  in due order. As far as the theoretical side is concerned, both teach  the existence of the Garbha as ultimate reality. While this lies in  ordinary people defiled by the evil passions and does not shine out in  its native purity, we cannot deny its existence in them. When the  external wrappage of impurities is peeled off we all become Buddhas and  Tathagatas. In fact, the birth of a Tathagata is nowhere else than in  this Garbha. 
 
The Garbha is from the psychological point of view the Alayavijnana,  all-conserving mind, in which good and bad are mingled, and the work of  the Yogin, that is, one who seeks the truth by means of self-discipline,  is to separate the one from the other. Why is the Alaya found  contaminated by evil thoughts and desires? What is the evil? How does it  come out in this world? How is the truth to be realised? These  questions are answered by postulating a system of Vijnanas and by the  doctrine of Discrimination (<em>vikalpa</em>), as has already been  expounded above. 
 
This is the point where the <em>Lanka</em> comes in contact with the  Yogacara school. The Yogacara is essentially psychological standing in  contrast in this respect to the Madhyamaka school which is  epistemological. But the Alayavijnana of the Yogacara is not the same as  that of <em>Lanka</em> and the <em>Awakening of Faith</em>. The former  conceives the Alaya to be purity itself with nothing defiled in it  whereas the <em>Lanka</em> and the <em>Awakening</em> make it the cause of  purity and defilement. Further, the Yogacara upholds the theory of  Vijnaptimatra and not that of Cittamatra, which belongs to the <em>Lanka,  Avatamsaka</em>, and <em>Awakening of Faith</em>. The difference is this:  According to the Vijnaptimatra, the world is nothing but ideas, there  are no realities behind them; but the Cittamatra states that there is  nothing but Citta, Mind, in the world and that the world is the  objectification of Mind. The one is pure idealism and the other  idealistic realism. 
 
To realise the Cittamatra is the object of the <em>Lanka</em>, and this  is done when Discrimination is discarded, that is, when a state of  non-discrimination is attained in one's spiritual life. Discrimination  is a logical term and belongs to the intellect. Thus we see that the end  of the religious discipline is to go beyond intellectualism, for to  discriminate, to divide, is the function of the intellect. Logic does  not lead one to self-realisation. Hence Nagarjuna's hair-splitting  dialectics. His idea is to prove the ineffectiveness of logic in the  domain of our spiritual life. This is where the <em>Lanka</em> joins hands  with the Madhyamaka. The doctrine of the Void is indeed the foundation  of Mahayana philosophy. But this is not to be understood in the manner  of analytical reasoning. The <em>Lanka</em> is quite explicit and not to  be mistaken in this respect. 
 
So far, the <em>Lanka</em> may seem to be only a philosophical treatise  with nothing religious in it, but the fact is that the Sutra is deeply  tinged with religious sentiments. For instance, the Bodhisattva would  not enter into Nirvana because of his vows to save all sentient beings,  and his vows are not limited in time and space, and for this reason they  are called "inexhaustible". Not only are his vows inexhaustible but the  "skilful means" he uses for the emancipation of all beings know no  limits. He knows how to make the best use of his inexhaustible resources  intellectual and practical for this single purpose. Here we may say  that the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra of the <em>Avatamsaka</em> or the <em>Gandavyuha</em> is reflected. 
 
In the <em>Lanka</em> all the most fundamental conceptions of the  Mahayana are thrown in without any attempt on the part of the compiler  or compilers to give them a system. This is left to the thoughtful  reader himself who will pick them up from the medley and string them  into a garland of pearls out of his own religious experience. 
 
The one significant Mahayana thought, however, which is not expressly  touched upon in the Sutra is that of Parinamana. <em>Parinamana</em> means to turn one's merit over to somebody else so as to expedite the  latter's attainment of Nirvana. If anybody does anything good, its merit  is sure to come back to the doer himself—this is the doctrine of Karma;  but according to the Mahayana the recipient need not always be the doer  himself, he may be anybody, he may be the whole world; merit being of  universal character can be transferred upon anything the doer wishes.  This transferability is known as the doctrine of Parinamana, the turning  over of one's good work to somebody else. This idea comes from the  philosophical teaching of Interpenetration as upheld in the <em>Avatamsaka</em>.

### The Date of the Lanka 
 
As is the case with other Buddhist texts it is quite impossible with  our present knowledge of Indian history to decide the age of the <em>Lanka</em>.  The one thing that is certain is that it was compiled before 443 a. d.  when the first Chinese translation is reported to have been attempted.  But this does not mean that the whole text as we have it now was then  already in existence, for we know that the later translations done in  513 and 700-704 contain the Dharani and the Sagathakam section which are  missing in the 443 one (<a title="Taisho Tripitaka Vol. T16, No. 670. 楞伽阿跋多羅寶經" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/cbeta/result/T16/T16n0670.htm">Sung</a>). Further,  the Meat-eating chapter also suffered certain modifications, especially  in the 513 (<a title="Taisho Tripitaka Vol. T16, No. 671. 入楞伽經" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/cbeta/result/T16/T16n0671.htm">Wei</a>) one. 
 
Even with the text that was in existence before 443 a. d. we do not  know how it developed, for it was not surely written from the beginning  as one complete piece of work as we write a book in these modern days.  Some parts of it must be older than others, since there is no doubt that  it has many layers of added passages. 
 
To a certain extent, the contents may give a clue to the age of the  text, but because of the difficulty of separating one part from another  from the point of view of textual criticism, arguments from the contents  as to the date are of very doubtful character. As long as we have  practically no knowledge of historical circumstances in which the  Buddhist texts were produced one after another in India or somewhere  else, all the statements are more or less of the character of an  ingenious surmise. All that we can say is this that the <em>Lanka</em> is  not a discourse directly given by the founder of Buddhism, that it is a  later composition than the Nikayas or Agamas which also developed some  time after the Buddha, that when Mahayana thoughts began to crystallise  in the Northern as well as in the Southern part of India probably about  the Christian era or even earlier, the compiler or compilers began to  collect passages as he or they came across in their study of the  Mahayana, which finally resulted in the Buddhist text now known under  the title of <em>Lankavatara-sutra</em>. 
 
### Some Remarks Concerning the Text 
 
Certain irregularities of the chapter-endings are to be noticed in  this connection. Generally these endings show that the chapters are  composite parts of a sutra and belong to it; but in the case of the <em>Lanka</em> some endings are quite of an independent character, and their relation  to the text is not at all definite. For instance: 
 
Chapter I—"Chapter One Known as Ravana-invitation"; 
 
Chapter II—"Here Ends Chapter Two Known as the Collection of All the  Dharmas in the 36, 000 (sloka) Lankavatara"; 
 
Chapter III—"Here Ends Chapter Three on Impermanency in the  Lankavatara, a Mahayana Sutra"; 
 
Chapter IV—"Here Ends Chapter Four on Realisation"; 
 
Chapter V—"Here Ends Chapter Five on the Permamency and Impermanency  of the Tathagata"; 
 
Chapter VI—"Here Ends Chapter Six on Momentariness"; 
 
Chapter VII—"Here Ends Chapter Seven on Egolessness"; 
 
Chapter VIII—"Here Ends Chapter Eight on Meat-eating from the  Lankavatara which is the Essence of All the Buddha-Teachings"; 
 
Chapter IX—"Here Ends Chapter Nine Known as Dharani in the  Lankavatara." 
 
These irregularities, at least in one case, show that there was a  larger <em>Lanka</em> containing 36, 000 slokas_1_ as referred to  in Fa-tsang's notices,_2_ and in another case that the <em>Lanka</em> was also known, or contained, a chapter known as the "Essence of all  the Buddha-teachings" which is indeed a sort of subtitle given to the  four-volume Chinese <em>Lanka</em> by <a title="Taisho Tripitaka Vol. T16, No. 670. 楞伽阿跋多羅寶經" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/cbeta/result/T16/T16n0670.htm">Gunabhadra (Sung)</a>,  443 a. d. 
 
_1_Suggested by Mr Hokei Idzumi. 
 
_2_See my <em>Studies in the Lankavatara Sutra</em>, p. 42. 
 
The Gatha section called "Sagathakam" presents peculiar difficulties.  As the earliest Chinese translation by Gunabhadra does not contain it,  it is highly probable that it was not then included in the <em>Lanka</em> text. But the fact that both the Wei version and the Sanskrit edition  contain not only the verses properly belonging to the Sagathakam but  those_1_ already appearing in the prose section, hints at the  existence of a larger or more complete text of the <em>Lanka</em> in which  all these Sagathakam verses were incorporated in the prose section,  which, therefore, must have been naturally much fuller than the existing  <em>Lanka</em>—perhaps something like the one Containing 36, 000 slokas.  There are many verses in the Sagathakam which are too obscure to be  intelligently interpreted without their corresponding prose passages.  The verses are generally meant for memorising the principal doctrines,  and they give sometimes no sense when they are separately considered,  for some watch-words only are rhythmically arranged to facilitate the  memory. 
 
In the Sanskrit text, the Sagathakam begins with this stanza: 
 
<blockquote>"Listen to the wonderful Mahayana doctrine, 
 
Declared in this Lankavatara Sutra, 
 
Composed in verse-gems, 
 
And destroying a net of the philosophical views."</blockquote> 
 
This may be understood to mean that this section is that part of the <em>Lanka</em> which is made up with the verses, that is to say, the verses taken from  the entire text of the <em>Lanka</em>. The term <em>sagathakam</em> also  suggests this, for it means the "one with verses." But in this case the  following questions may be asked: 
 
If there were a larger <em>Lanka</em> containing all these verses in  the Sagathakam in the body of the text, or if there were a <em>Lanka</em> with the verses alone and as a separete text which was later on put  together with the present one, are all these verses as a whole to be  regarded as belonging to the same period? If so, what caused the  disappearance of the prose passages which accompanied the verses now  retained in the Sagathakam only? Is there no possibility of some of the  verses added later to the text independently? There is some evidence of  such additions as we can see, for instance, in the conception of the  Sambhogakaya (verse 384) and of the ninth Vijnana (verse 13), which are  surely of later development. The solution of these and some other  possible questions is to be left to some future time when all the  circumstances leading to the production of the Buddhist sutras Mahayana  and Hinayana in various districts of India are ascertained. 
 
_1_ These are systematically excluded in the T'ang. 
 
The best way of reading the <em>Lanka</em>, as I said in my <em>Studies</em>,  is to cut the whole text into as many pieces_1_ as the sense  allows and to regard each piece as completely expressing one chief  thought in the philosophy of Mahayana Buddhism. In some cases the pieces  so severed may seem to conflict with one another. In such cases a  higher principle will be found somewhere else that unifies the two  contradictory notions harmoniously. For after all there is but one  highest truth in the <em>Lanka</em>, of which all others are so many  aspects viewed at various angles of thought. 
 
I thought I would treat the Sagathakam in a similar manner, by  dividing the whole portion into so many groups of verses, each of which  is presumably concerned with one theme. But the verses being too concise  and often merely mnemonic, one finds it too risky to cut them up into  groups and to take the latter as containing so many definite sets of  thoughts. As we notice in the cases of repetition occurring so  frequently in the Sagathakam the verses are not solidly transferred from  the text, that is, they are not always found in the Sagathakam in the  same order as they are in the text proper, nor are they complete.  Sometimes one single verse is taken out of the group where it belongs in  the main text and inserted in an unexpected connection. In these  circumstances I thought it wise to leave the Sagathakam as it stands and  not to arrange the verses into groups until we know more exactly about  the historical evolution of this portion of the <em>Lanka</em>. 
 
_1_ This cutting is indicated in the following translation  by the Roman figures running consecutively through the entire text  except the Ravana, the Dharani, and the Meat-eating chapter, where no  such dividing is necessary. 
 
In fact, the Sagathakam is a curious mixture where subjects not at  all referred to in the prose section are in juxtaposition with those  that have to my view no proper bearing in the <em>Lanka</em>. Such  subjects are those historical narratives concerning Vyasa, Katyayana,  Nagahvaya, etc., and those relating to the monastery life. And then  there are some passages in the Sagathakam which may be regarded as later  additions. For instance, when it refers to eight or nine several  Vijnanas (verse 13), two forms of Alaya (v. 59), the triple body (v.  434), thirty-six Buddhas (v. 380), etc., they are evidently later  incorporations. The Sagathakam requires more study from the point of  text criticism, and also from the point of doctrinal, literary, and  monachical history. 
 
### The Transmission History of the Lanka 
 
In the book called <a title="Taisho Tripitaka Vol. T85, No. 2837" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/cbeta/result/T85/T85n2837.htm">楞伽師資記</a>,  "Record of Master and Disciple in [the Transmission of] the Lanka",  which is one of the Tung-huang findings, the transmission line of the <em>Lanka</em> is recorded. The author 淨覺, Ching-chueh,  living probably early in the eighth century apparently identified Zen  Buddhism with the teaching of the <em>Lanka</em>, for his Fathers of the <em>Lanka</em> transmission are also those of Zen Buddhism. He considers Gunabhadra,  the translator of the Sung or four volume <em>Lanka</em>, the first Father  of Zen in China, and not Bodhidharma as is generally done by Zen  historians. In this the author may be in the right, for in his day there  was yet no independent school which later came to be known as "Zen",  and whatever represented this movement at the time was no more than the  study of the <em>Lanka</em>. Moreover, Ching-chueh belonged to the school  of Hsuan-tse (玄賾) and Shen-hsiu (神秀) who upheld the <em>Lanka</em> in opposition to  their rival Hui-neng's 慧能 <em>Vajracchedika</em>.  This book is one of the most valuable documents for the historical  students of early Zen Buddhism in China._1_ It contains so much  information of definite character concerning its Fathers whose sayings  and teachings have so far been shrouded in obscurity. 
 
There is Another equally valuable history of Zen Buddhism which was  also discovered in the Tung-huang cave. It is entitled <a title="Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 51, No. 2075" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/cbeta/result/app/T51/2075_001.htm">歷代法寶記</a> "Record of the Succession of the Dharma-treasure." This was evidently  written to contend the position of the 楞伽師資記,  for it insists that the first Father of the <em>Lanka</em> as representing  the Dharma-treasure was Bodhidharma and not Gunabhadra who was mere  translator and not the revealer of the inner meaning of the Sutra.  Therefore, the history of Zen Buddhism in China, which is the  "Dharma-treasure", should properly begin with Bodhidharma. The author  evidently belongs to the school of Hui-neng. 
 
The discovery of these two important historical works on Zen,  together with the <em>Sayings of Shen-hui</em>, 神會語錄,  which was edited by 胡適, Professor Hu Hsi of  Peking University, 1930, with his able critical notes, sheds an  abundance of light on the early pages of Zen history in China. As a  detailed discussion of the subject does not belong here, I reserve it  for my <em>Essays in Zen Buddhism</em>, Series II. 
 
### The Present English Translation 
 
As regards the English translation of the Sutra, I have decided after  much hesitation to send it out to the public with all its many  imperfections. It is a bold attempt on the part of the translator to try  to render some of the deepest thoughts that have been nourished in the  East into a language to which he was not born. But his idea is that if  somebody did not make a first attempt, however poor and defective, the  precious stones may remain buried unknown except to a few scholars, and  this perhaps longer than necessary. And then things develop. As it is  illustrated in the long history of the Chinese translations of the  Buddhist texts, there must be several attempts before the work assumes  something of finality. There are at present three Chinese translations  and one Tibetan of the <em>Lanka</em>, and the first shows many traces of  immaturity when compared with the third. We can easily understand the  difficulties Chinese scholars encountered in trying to master the  translations. The <a title="Taisho Tripitaka Vol. T16, No. 672. 大乘入楞伽經" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/cbeta/result/T16/T16n0672.htm">T'ang</a> version  could not perhaps be so perfect as it is unless it had two or three  predecessors. 
 
_1_ The book has been quite recently edited by Kin Kyukei, a  librarian attached to Peking University and published in Peking. He was  able to do this helped by Professor Hu Hsi, who is the owner of the  photographic copies of the original Manuscripts of 楞伽師 資記 preserved in the British Museum and in the Biblioth�que  Nationale. A collotype impression of the London MS which is not so  complete as the Paris MS, though it is very much more legible than the  latter, was published by Professor Keiki Yabuki of Japan, in his  collection of the Tun-huang MSS, entitled 嗚沙餘韻,  "Echoes of the Desert", 1930. 
 
I have done all I could to make my translation as intelligible as  possible to my readers. If I tried to be too literal, it would be quite  unintelligible. The modes of expression are so different in the  Sanskrit. There are still many obscure passages which I failed to  interpret satisfactorily to myself. These obscurities are found more in  the Sagathakam, because the verses presuppose much knowledge of the  matter treated therein, and this knowledge involves at present much more  scholarship and intellectual perspicuity than the present translator  can command. The Sagathakam has never had any Chinese commentaries, and  this fact adds more to the difficulties already in existence. Chinese  and Japanese scholars have chosen, probably for brevity's sake, the  four-volume text by Gunabhadra for their study, and the Sagathakam has  thus inevitably been left out. 
 
The Sanskrit text itself as we have it is still far from being  perfect, and there is no doubt that Nanjo's edition requires many  corrections in order to yield a more intelligible reading. Even with it,  however, whatever shortcomings it may have, we are to be grateful to  the editor who made the text more accessible to the public than ever  before. 
 
I have not always followed Nanjo in the reading of the text. I have  used my own judgment in several cases when I thought the sense became  thereby clearer. In paragraphing too I have often disregarded Nanjo. As I  said in my <em>Studies</em>, the <em>Lanka</em> is a highly chaotic text,  and there are also some passages which have forced their way in wrong  places where they do not belong. 
 
The <a title="Taisho Tripitaka Vol. T16, No. 672. 大乘入楞伽經" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/cbeta/result/T16/T16n0672.htm">T'ang</a> version in  this respect gives on the whole the best rendering of the <em>Lanka</em>.  While a first draft of the translation was prepared by Sikshananda, the  finishing touch was given by Fa-tsang, the great teacher of philosophy  of the <em>Avatamsaka</em>, with which the <em>Lanka</em> is in the closest  relationship. When difficulties were encountered in the course of my  English translation of the Sanskrit text, I have quite frequently  followed the T'ang reading, though the fact has not regularly been  noted. 
 
A special index to the Sutra is being prepared and will be issued  before long as a separate volume.

## [CHAPTER ONE] 
 
</a> 
 
(<a name="1"><strong>1</strong></a>)_1_ Om! Salutation to the Triple  Treasure! Salutation to all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas! 
 
Here is carefully written down the <em>Lankavatara Sutra</em> in which  the Lord of the Dharma discourses on the egolessness of all things. 
 
Thus have I heard. The Blessed One once stayed in the Castle of Lanka  which is situated on the peak of Mount Malaya on the great ocean, and  which is adorned with flowers made of jewels of various kinds._2_ He was with a large assembly of Bhikshus and with a great multitude of  Bodhisattvas, who had come together from various Buddha-lands. The  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas, headed by the Bodhisattva Mahamati, were all  perfect masters_3_ of the various Samadhis, the [tenfold]  self-mastery, the [ten] powers, and the [six] psychic faculties; they  were anointed by the hands of all the Buddhas; they all well understood  the significance of the objective world as the manifestation of their  own Mind<strong>;</strong> (<a name="2"><strong>2</strong></a>) they knew how to maintain  [various] forms, teachings, and disciplinary measures, according to the  various mentalities and behaviours of beings; they were thoroughly  versed in the five Dharmas, the [three] Svabhavas, the [eight] Vijnanas,  and the twofold Non-atman. 
 
_1_ These Gothic numerals in parentheses refer to pages of  the Sanskrit edition. 
 
_2_ Much more fully described in Bodhiruci (Wei). 
 
_3_ Literally, "sporting" (<em>vikridita</em>). 
 
At that time, the Blessed One who had been preaching in the palace of  the King of Sea-serpents came out at the expiration of seven days and  was greeted by an innumerable host of Nagakanyas including Sakra and  Brahma, and looking at Lanka on Mount Malaya smiled and said, "By the  Tathagatas of the past, who were Arhats and Fully-Enlightened Ones, this  Truth was made the subject of their discourse, at that castle of Lanka  on the mountain-peak of Malaya, —the Truth realisable by noble wisdom in  one's inmost self, which is beyond the reasoning knowledge of the  philosophers as well as the state of consciousness of the Sravakas and  Pratyekabuddhas._1_ I, too, would now for the sake of Ravana,  Overlord of the Yakshas, discourse on this Truth." 
 
[Inspired] by the spiritual power of the Tathagata, Ravana, Lord of  the Rakshasas, heard [his voice]. Indeed, the Blessed One, surrounded  and accompanied by an in-numerable host of Nagakanyas including Sakra  and Brahma, came out of the palace of the King of Sea-serpents; and  looking at the waves of the ocean and also at the mental agitations  going on in those assembled, [he thought of] the ocean of the  Alayavijnana where the evolving Vijnanas [like the waves] are stirred by  the wind of objectivity. While he was standing there [thus absorbed in  contemplation, Ravana saw him and] uttered a joyous cry, saying: "I will  go and request of the Blessed One to enter into Lanka; for this long  night he would probably profit, do good, and gladden (<a name="3"><strong>3</strong></a>)  the gods as well as human beings." 
 
Thereupon, Ravana, Lord of the Rakshasas, with his attendants, riding  in his floral celestial chariot, came up where the Blessed One was, and  having arrived there he and his attendants came out of the chariot.  Walking around the Blessed One three times from left to right, they  played on a musical instrument, beating it with a stick of blue Indra  (saphire), and hanging the lute at one side, which was inlaid with the  choicest lapis lazuli and supported by [a ribbon of] priceless cloth,  yellowish-white like Priyangu, they sang with various notes such as  Saharshya, Rishabha, Gandhara, Dhaivata, Nishada. Madyama, and Kaisika,_2_ which were melodiously modulated in Grama, Murchana, etc.; the voice in  accompaniment with the flute beautifully blended with the measure of  the Gatha. 
 
_1_ The Sanskrit text is here certainly at fault; there  ought to be a negative particle somewhere in this passage, which is the  case in the Chinese translations. 
 
_2_ Neither Bodhiruci nor Sikshananda refers so specifically  to these various notes. 
 
1. "The truth-treasure whose principle is the self-nature of Mind,  has no selfhood (<em>nairatmyam</em>), stands above all reasoning, and is  free from impurities; it points to the knowledge attained in one's  inmost self; Lord, show me here the way leading to the Truth. 
 
2. "The Sugata is the body in whom are stored immaculate virtues; in  him are manifested [bodies] trans-forming and transformed; he enjoys the  Truth realised in his inmost self; may he visit Lanka. Now is the time,  Muni! 
 
3. (<a name="4"><strong>4</strong></a>) "This Lanka was inhabited by the  Buddhas of the past, and [they were] accompanied by their sons who were  owners of many forms. Lord, show me now the highest Truth, and the  Yakshas who are endowed with many forms will listen." 
 
Thereupon, Ravana, the Lord of Lanka, further adapting the Totaka  rhythm sang this in the measure of the Gatha. 
 
4. After seven nights, the Blessed One leaving the ocean which is the  abode of the Makara, the palace of the sea-king, now stands on the  shore. 
 
5. Just as the Buddha rises, Ravana, accompanied by the Apsaras and  Yakshas numerous, by Suka, Sarana, and learned men, 
 
6. Miraculously goes over to the place where the Lord is standing.  Alighting from the floral vehicle, he greets the Tathagata  reverentially, makes him offerings, tells him who he is, and stands by  the Lord. 
 
7. "I who have come here, am called Ravana, the ten-headed king of  the Rakshasas, mayest thou graciously receive me with Lanka and all its  residents. 
 
8. "In this city, the inmost state of consciousness realised, indeed,  by the Enlightened Ones of the past (<a name="5"><strong>5</strong></a>) was  disclosed on this peak studded with precious stones. 
 
9. "Let the Blessed One, too. surrounded by sons of the Victorious  One, now disclose the Truth immaculate on this peak embellished with  precious stones; we, together with the residents of Lanka, desire to  listen. 
 
10. "The <em>Lankavatara Sutra</em> which is praised by the Buddhas of  the past [discloses] the inmost state of consciousness realised by them,  which is not founded on any system of doctrine. 
 
11. "I recollect the Buddhas of the past surrounded by sons of the  Victorious One recite this Sutra; the Blessed One, too, will speak. 
 
12. "In the time to come, there will be Buddhas and Buddha-Sons  pitying the Yakshas; the Leaders will discourse on this magnificent  doctrine on the peak adorned with precious stones. 
 
13. "This magnificent city of Lanka is adorned with varieties of  precious stones, [surrounded] by peaks, refresh-ing and beautiful and  canopied by a net of jewels. 
 
14. "Blessed One, here are the Yakshas who are free from faults of  greed, reflecting on [the Truth] realised in one's inmost self and  making offerings to the Buddhas of the past; they are believers in the  teaching of the Mahayana and intent on disciplining one another. 
 
15. "There are younger Yakshas, girls and boys, desiring to know the  Mahayana. Come, Blessed One, who art our Teacher, come to Lanka on Mount  Malaya. 
 
16. (<a name="6"><strong>6</strong></a>) "The Rakshasas, with Kumbhakarna at  their head, who are residing in the city, wish, as they are devoted to  the Mahayana, to hear about this inmost realisation. 
 
17. "They have made offerings assiduously to the Buddhas [in the  past] and are to-day going to do the same. Come, for compassion's sake,  to the Lanka, together with [thy] sons. 
 
18. "Mahamati, accept my mansion, the company of the Apsaras,  necklaces of various sorts, and the delightful Asoka garden. 
 
19. "I give myself up to serve the Buddhas and their sons; there is  nothing with me that I do not give up [for their sake]; Great Muni, have  compassion on me!" 
 
20. Hearing him speak thus, the Lord of the Triple World said, "King  of Yakshas, this mountain of precious stones was visited by the Leaders  in the past. 
 
21. "And, taking pity on you, they discoursed on the Truth revealed  in their inmost [consciousness]. [The Buddhas of] the future time will  proclaim [the same] on this jewel-adorned mountain. 
 
22. "This [inmost Truth] is the abode of those Yogins who stand in  the presence of the Truth. King of the Yakshas, you have the compassion  of the Sugatas and myself." 
 
23. The Blessed One accepting the request [of the King] remained  silent and undisturbed; he now mounted the floral chariot offered by  Ravana. 
 
24. Thus Ravana and others, wise sons of the Victorious One, (<a name="7"><strong>7</strong></a>) honoured by the Apsaras singing and dancing,  reached the city. 
 
25. Arriving in the delightful city [the Buddha was] again the  recipient of honours; he was honoured by the group of Yakshas including  Ravana and by the Yaksha women. 
 
26. A net of jewels was offered to the Buddha by the younger Yakshas,  girls and boys, and necklaces beautifully ornamented with jewels were  placed by Ravana about the neck of the Buddha and those of the sons of  the Buddha. 
 
27. The Buddhas together with the sons of the Buddha and the wise  men, accepting the offerings, discoursed on the Truth which is the state  of consciousness realised in the inmost self. 
 
28. Honouring [him as] the best speaker, Ravana and the company of  the Yakshas honoured Mahamati and requested of him again and again:_1_ 
 
29. "Thou art the asker of the Buddha concerning the state of  consciousness realised in their inmost selves, of which we here, Yakshas  as well as the sons of the Buddha, are desirous of hearing. I, together  with the Yakshas, the sons of the Buddha, and the wise men, request  this of thee. 
 
30. "Thou art the most eloquent of speakers, and the most strenuous  of the Yogins; with faith I beg of thee. Ask [the Buddha] about the  doctrine, O thou the proficient one! 
 
_1_ Verses 20-28, inclusive, are in prose in T'ang. 
 
31. "Free from the faults of the philosophers and Pratyekabuddhas and  Sravakas is (<a name="8"><strong>8</strong></a>) the Truth of the inmost  consciousness, immaculate and culminating in the stage of Buddhahood." 
 
32._1_ Thereupon the Blessed One created jewel-adorned  mountains and other objects magnificently embellished with jewels in an  immense number. 
 
33. On the summit of each mountain the Buddha himself was visible,  and Ravana, the Yaksha, also was found standing there. 
 
34. Thus the entire assembly was seen on each mountain-peak, and all  the countries Were there, and in each there was a Leader. 
 
35. Here also was the King of the Rakshasas and the residents of  Lanka, and the Lanka created by the Buddha rivaling [the real one]. 
 
36. Other things were there, too, —the Asoka with its shining woods,  and on each mountain-peak Mahamati was making a request of the Buddha, 
 
37. Who discoursed for the sake of the Yakshas on the Truth leading  to the inmost realisation; on the mountain-peak he delivered a complete  sutra with an exquisite voice varied in hundreds of thousands of ways._2_ 
 
38. [After this] the teacher and the sons of the Buddha vanished away  in the air, leaving Ravana the Yaksha himself standing [above] in his  mansion. 
 
39. Thought he, "How is this? What means this? and by whom was it  heard? What was it that was seen? and by whom was it seen? Where is the  city? and where is the Buddha? 
 
40. "Where are those countries, those jewel-shining Buddhas, those  Sugatas? (<a name="9"><strong>9</strong></a>) Is it a dream then? or a vision? or  is it a castle conjured up by the Gandharvas? 
 
_1_ From this verse T'ang is in prose again. 
 
_2_ Thus according to Bodhiruci and Sikshananda. The  Sanskrit text has: "hundreds of thousands of perfect sutras." 
 
41. "Or is it dust in the eye, or a fata morgana, or the dream-child  of a barren woman, or the smoke of a fire-wheel, that which I saw here?" 
 
42. Then [Ravana reflected], "This is the nature as it is (<em>dharmata</em>)  of all things, which belongs to the realm of Mind, and it is not  comprehended by the ignorant as they are confused by every form of  imagination. 
 
43. "There is neither the seer nor the seen, neither the speaker nor  the spoken; the form and usage of the Buddha and his Dharma—they are  nothing but discrimination. 
 
44. "Those who see things such as were seen before, do not see the  Buddha; [even] when discrimination is not aroused, one does not see_1_ the Buddha; the Buddha being fully-enlightened is seen where the world  itself is not evolved. 
 
The Lord of Lanka was then immediately awakened [from his  reflection], feeling a revulsion (<em>paravriti</em>) in his mind and  realising that the world was nothing but his own mind<strong>: </strong>he was  settled in the realm of non-discrimination, was urged by the stock of  his past good deeds, acquired the cleverness of understanding all the  texts, obtained the faculty of seeing things as they are, was no more  dependent upon others, observed things excellently with his own wisdom (<em>buddhi</em>),  gained the insight that was not of discursive reasoning, was no more  dependent upon others,_2_ became a great Yogin of the  discipline, was able to manifest himself in all excellent forms, got  thoroughly acquainted with all skilful means, had the knowledge of the  characteristic aspects of every stage, by which he would surmount it  skilfully, was delighted to look into_3_ the self-nature of  Citta, Manas, Manovijnana, got a view whereby he could cut himself loose  from the triple continuation, had the knowledge of disposing of every  argument of (<a name="10"><strong>10</strong></a>) the philosophers on causation,  thoroughly understood the Tathagata-garbha, the stage of Buddhahood, the  inmost self, found himself abiding in the Buddha-knowledge; [when  suddenly] a voice was heard from the sky, saying, "It is to be known by  oneself." 
 
_1_ T'ang has: "He who sees in the way as was seen before,  cannot see the Buddha; when no discrimination is aroused, this, indeed,  is the seeing." According to Wei: "If he sees things and takes them for  realities, he does not see the Buddha. Even when he is not abiding in a  discriminating mind, he cannot see the Buddha. Not seeing anything doing  [in the world]—this is said to be seeing the Buddha. If a man is able  thus to see [things], he is the one who sees the Tathagata. When the  wise observe all experiences in this manner, they are transformed  assuming an exquisite body—this is the Enlightenment [attained by] the  Buddha." 
 
_2_ This does not appear in T'ang, nor in Wei. 
 
_3_ T'ang: to go beyond. 
 
"Well done, well done, Lord of Lanka! Well done, indeed, Lord of  Lanka, for once more! The Yogin is to discipline himself as thou doest.  The Tathagatas and all things are to be viewed as they are viewed by  thee; otherwise viewed, it is nihilism. All things are to be  comprehended by transcending the Citta, Manas, and Vijnana as is done by  thee. Thou shouldst look inwardly and not become attached to the letter  and a superficial view of things; thou shouldst not fall into the  attainments, conceptions, experiences, views, and Samadhis of the  Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and philosophers; thou shouldst not have any  liking for small talk and witticism; thou shouldst not cherish the  notion of self-substance,_1_ nor have any thought for the  vainglory of rulership, nor dwell on such Dhyanas as belong to the six  Dhyanas, etc. 
 
"Lord of Lanka, this is the realisation of the great Yogins: to  destroy the discourses advanced by others, to crush mischievous views in  pieces, to keep themselves properly away from ego-centered notions, to  cause a revulsion in the depths of the mind fittingly by means of an  exquisite knowledge. Such are sons of the Buddha who walk in the way of  the Mahayana. In order to enter upon the stage of self-realisation as  attained by the Tathagatas, the discipline is to be pursued by thee. 
 
_1_ Wei and T'ang: Do not hold the views maintained in the  Vedas. 
 
"Lord of Lanka, conducting thyself in this manner, let thee be  further purified in the way thou hast attained; (<a name="11"><strong>11</strong></a>)  by disciplining thyself well in Samadhi and Samapatti, follow not the  state realised and enjoyed by the Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and  philosophers, which rises from the imagination of those who discipline  themselves according to the practices of the puerile philosophers. They  cling to the individual forms of the world created by their egotistical  ideas; they maintain such notions as element, quality, and substance;  they cling tenaciously to views originating from ignorance; they become  confused by cherishing the idea of birth where prevails emptiness; they  cling to discrimination [as real]; they fall into the way of thinking  where obtains [the dualism of] qualifying and qualified. 
 
"Lord of Lanka, this is what leads to various excellent attainments,  this is what makes one grow aware of the inmost attainment, this is the  Mahayana realisation. This will result in the acquirement of an  excellent condition of existence. 
 
"Lord of Lanka, by entering upon the Mahayana discipline the veils  [of ignorance] are destroyed, and one turns away from the multitudinous  waves of the Vijnana and falls not into the refuge and practice of the  philosophers. 
 
"Lord of Lanka, the philosophers' practice starts from their own  egotistic attachments. Their ugly practice arises from adhering to  dualistic views concerning the self-nature of the Vijnana. 
 
"Well done, Lord of Lanka; reflect on the signification of this as  you did when seeing the Tathagata before; for this, indeed, is seeing  the Tathagata." 
 
At that time it occurred to Ravana<strong>: </strong>"I wish to see the Blessed  One again, who has all the disciplinary practices at his command, who  has turned away from the practices of the philosophers, who is born of  the state of realisation in the inmost consciousness, and who is beyond  [the dualism of] the transformed and the transforming. He is the  knowledge (<a name="12"><strong>12</strong></a>) realised by the Yogins, he is the  realisation attained by those who enjoy the perfect bliss of the  Samadhi which they gain by coming to an intuitive understanding through  meditation. May I see thus [again] the Compassionate One by means of his  miraculous powers in whom the fuel of passion and discrimination is  destroyed, who is surrounded by sons of the Buddha, who has penetrated  into the minds and thoughts of all beings, who moves about everywhere,  who knows everything, who keeps himself away from work (<em>kriya</em>)  and form (<em>lakshana</em>); seeing him may I attain what I have not yet  attained, [retain] what I have already gained, may I conduct myself with  non-discrimination, abide in the joy of Samadhi and Samapatti, and  attain the ground where the Tathagatas walk, and in these make  progress." 
 
At that moment, the Blessed One recognising that the Lord of Lanka is  to attain the Anutpattikadharmakshanti showed his glorious compassion  for the ten-headed one by making himself visible once more on the  mountain-peak studded with many jewels and enveloped in a net-work of  jewels. The ten-headed King of Lanka saw the splendour again as seen  before on the mountain-peak, [he saw] the Tathagata, who was the Arhat  and the Fully-Enlightened One, with the thirty-two marks of excellence  beautifully adorning his person, and also saw himself on each  mountain-peak, together with Mahamati, in front of the Tathagata, the  Fully-Enlightened One, putting forward his discourse on the realisation  experienced by the Tathagata in his inmost self, and, surrounded by the  Yakshas, conversing on the verbal teachings and stories [of the Buddha].  Those (<a name="13"><strong>13</strong></a>) [Buddha]-lands were seen with the  Leaders._1_ 
 
_1_ There is surely a discrepancy here in the text. T'ang  reads: "In all the Buddha-lands in the ten quarters were also seen such  events going on, and there was no difference whatever." Wei is quite  different and has the following: "Besides, he saw all the Buddha-lands  and all the kings thinking of the transitoriness of the body. As they  are covetously attached to their thrones, wives, children, and  relatives, they find themselves bound by the five passions and have no  time for emancipation. Seeing this, they abandon their dominions,  palaces, wives, concubines, elephants, horses, and precious treasures,  giving them all up to the Buddha and his Brotherhood. They now retreat  into the mountain-woods, leaving their homes and wishing to study the  doctrine. He [Ravana] then sees the Bodhisattvas in the mountain woods  strenuously applying themseves to the mastery of the truth, even to the  extent of throwing themselves to the hungry tiger, lion, and Rakshasas.  He thus sees the Bodhisattvas reading and reciting the sutras under a  tree in the woods and discoursing on them for others, seeking thereby  the truth of the Buddha. He then sees the Bodhisattvas seated under the  Bodhi-tree in the Bodhi-mandala thinking of the suffering Beings and  meditating on the truth of the Buddha. He then sees the venerable  Mahamati the Bodhisattva before each Buddha preaching about the  spiritual discipline of one's inner life, and also sees [the  Bodhisattva] surrounded by all the Yakshas and families and talking  about names, words, phrases, and paragraphs." This last sentence is  evidently the translation of the Sanskrit <em>desanapathakatham</em>,  which is contrasted in the <em>Lankavatara</em> throughout with <em>pratyatmaryajnanagocara</em> (the spiritual realm realised by noble wisdom in one's inmost  consciousness). 
 
Then the Blessed One beholding again this great assembly with his  wisdom-eye, which is not the human eye, laughed loudly and most  vigorously like the lion-king. Emitting rays of light from the tuft of  hair between the eyebrows, from the ribs, from the loins, from the  Srivatsa_1 _on the breast, and from every pore of the skin,  —emitting rays of light which shone flaming like the fire taking place  at the end of a kalpa, like a luminous rainbow, like the rising sun,  blazing brilliantly, gloriously—which were observed from the sky by  Sakra, Brahma, and the guardians of the world, the one who sat on the  peak [of Lanka] vying with Mount Sumeru laughed the loudest laugh. At  that time the assembly of the Bodhisattvas together with Sakra and  Brahma, each thought within himself: 
 
"For what reason, I wonder, from what cause does the Blessed One who  is the master of all the world (<em>sarva-dharma-vasavartin</em>), after  smiling first,_2_ laugh the loudest laugh? Why does he emit  rays of light from his own body? Why, emitting [rays of light], does he  remain silent, with the realisation [of the Truth] in his inmost self,  and absorbed deeply and showing no surprise in the bliss of Samadhi, and  reviewing the [ten] quarters, looking around like the lion-king, and  thinking only of the discipline, attainment, and performance of Ravana?" 
 
_1_ Swastika. 
 
_2_ This is wanting in the Chinese translations. 
 
At that time, Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva who was previously  requested by Ravana [to ask the Buddha concerning his self-realisation],  feeling pity on him, (<a name="14"><strong>14</strong></a>) and knowing the minds  and thoughts of the assembly of the Bodhisattvas, and observing that  beings to be born in the future would be confused in their minds because  of their delight in the verbal teaching (<em>desanapatha</em>), because  of their clinging to the letter as [fully in accordance with] the spirit  (<em>artha</em>), because of their clinging to the disciplinary powers of  the Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and philosophers, —which might lead them  to think how it were that the Tathagatas, the Blessed Ones, even in  their transcendental state of consciousness should burst out into  loudest laughter —Mahamati the Bodhisattva asked the Buddha in order to  put a stop to their inquisitiveness the following question: "For what  reason, for what cause did this laughter take place?" 
 
Said the Blessed One: "Well done, well done, Mahamati! Well done,  indeed, for once more, Mahamati! Viewing the world as it is in itself  and wishing to enlighten the people in the world who are fallen into a  wrong view of things in the past, present, and future, thou undertakest  to ask me the question. Thus should it be with the wise men who want to  ask questions for both themselves and others. Ravana, Lord of Lanka, O  Mahamati, asked a twofold question of the Tathagatas of the past who are  Arhats and perfect Buddhas; and he wishes now to ask me too a twofold  question in order to have its distinction, attainment, and scope  ascertained—this is what is never tasted by those who practise the  meditation of the Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and philosophers; and the  same will be asked by the question-loving ten-headed one of the Buddhas  to come." 
 
Knowing that, the Blessed One said to the Lord of Lanka, thus: "Ask,  thou Lord of Lanka; the Tathagata has given thee permission [to ask],  delay not, whatever questions thou desirest to have answered, I will  answer each of them (<a name="15"><strong>15</strong></a>) with judgment to the  satisfaction of your heart. Keeping thy seat of thought free from  [false] discrimination, observe well what is to be subdued at each  stage; ponder things with wisdom; [seeing into] the nature of the inner  principle in thyself, abide in the bliss of Samadhi; embraced by the  Buddhas in Samadhi, abide in the bliss of tranquillisation; going beyond  the Samadhi and understanding attained by the Sravakas and  Pratyekabuddhas, abide in [the attainment of the Bodhisattvas] in the  stages of Acala, Sadhumati, and Dharmamegha; grasp well the egolessness  of all things in its true significance; be anointed by the Buddhas in  Samadhi at the great palace of lotus-jewels. _1_Surrounded by  the Bodhisattvas who are sitting on lotuses of various sorts each  supported by the gracious power of the Buddhas, thou shalt find thyself  sitting on a lotus and each one of the Bodhisattvas looking at thee face  to face. This is a realm beyond the imagination. Thou shouldst plan out  an adequate plan and establish thyself at a stage of discipline by  planning out such a plan as shall include [all kinds of] skilful means,  so that thou comest to realise that realm which is beyond imagination;  and thou shouldst attain the stage of Tathagatahood in which one is able  to manifest oneself in various forms, and which is something never seen  before by the Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, philosophers, Brahma, Indra,  Upendra, and others. '' 
 
_1_ The following sentence is done by the aid of T'ang, as  the Sanskrit does not seem to give any sense. Literally translated it  reads: "There by the becoming lotuses, by those lotuses that are blessed  variously by the benediction of his own person.... " Wei has: "O King  of Lanka, thou wilt before long see thy person, too, thus sitting on the  lotus-throne and continuing to abide there in a most natural manner.  There are innumerable families of lotus-kings and innumerable families  of Bodhisattvas there, each one of whom is sitting on a lotus-throne,  and surrounded by those thou wilt find thyself and looking face to face  at one another, and each one of them will before long come to abide in a  realm beyond the understanding." 
 
At that moment the Lord of Lanka being permitted by the Blessed One,  rose from his seat on the peak of the jewel-mountain which shone like  the jewel-lotus immaculate and shining in splendour; he was surrounded  by a large company of celestial maidens, and all kinds of garlands,  flowers, perfumes, incense, unguents, umbrellas, banners, fiags,  necklaces, half-necklaces, diadems, tiaras, (<a name="16"><strong>16</strong></a>)  and other ornaments whose splendour and excellence were never heard of  or seen before, were created; music was played surpassing anything that  could be had by the gods, Nagas, Yakshas, Rakshasas, Gandharvas,  Kinnaras, Mahoragas, and men; musical instruments were created equal to  anything that could be had in all the world of desire and also such  superior musical instruments were created as were to be seen in the  Buddha-lands; the Blessed One and the Bodhisattvas were enveloped in a  net of jewels; a variety of dresses and high banners was made rising  high in the air as high as seven tala trees to great [the Buddha],  showering great clouds of offerings, playing music which resounded [all  around], and then descending from the air, [the Lord of Lanka] sat down  on the peak of the jewel-mountain ornamented with magnificent  jewel-lotus whose splendour was second only to the sun and lightning.  Sitting he made courtesy smiling first to the Blessed One for his  permission and proposed him a twofold question: " It was asked of the  Tathagatas of the past, who were Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones, and it  was solved by them. Blessed One, now I ask of thee; [the request] will  certainly be complied with by thee as far as verbal instruction is  concerned_1_ as it was by the Buddhas [of the past]. Blessed  One, duality was discoursed upon by the Transformed Tathagatas and  Tathagatas of Trans-formation, but not by the Tathagatas of Silence._2_ The Tathagatas of Silence are absorbed in the blissful state of  Samadhi, they do not discriminate concerning this state, nor do they  discourse on it. Blessed One, thou assuredly wilt discourse on this  subject of duality. Thou art thyself a master of all things, an Arhat, a  Tathagata. The sons of the Buddha and myself are anxious to listen to  it." 
 
_1_ That is, as far as the teaching could be conveyed in  words. <em>Desanapatha</em> stands in contrast with <em>siddhanta</em>, or <em>pratyatmagati</em> in the <em>Lankavatara</em>. 
 
_2_ In T'ang and Wei: "Original Tathagatas." 
 
The Blessed One said, "Lord of Lanka, tell me what you mean by  duality?" 
 
The Lord of the Rakshasas, (<a name="17"><strong>17</strong></a>) who was  renewed in his ornaments, full of splendour and beauty, with a diadem,  bracelet, and necklace strung with vajra thread, said, "It is said that  even dharmas are to be abandoned, and how much more adharmas. Blessed  One, why does this dualism exist that we are called upon to abandon?  What are adharmas? and what are dharmas? How can there be a duality of  things to abandon—a duality that arises from falling into  discrimination, from discriminating self-substance where there is none,  from [the idea of] things created (<em>bhautika</em>) and uncreated,  because the non-differentiating nature of the Alayavijnana is not  recognised? Like the seeing of a hair-circle as really existing in the  air, [the notion of dualism] belongs to the realm of intellection not  exhaustively pur-gated. This being the. case as it should be, how could  there be any abandonment [of dharmas and adharmas]?" 
 
Said the Blessed One, "Lord of Lanka, seest thou not that the  differentiation of things, such as is perceived in jars and other  breakable objects whose nature it is to perish in time, takes place in a  realm of discrimination [cherished by] the ignorant? This being so, is  it not to be so understood? It is due to discrimination [cherished by]  the ignorant that there exists the differentiation of dharma and  adharma. Noble wisdom (<em>aryajnana</em>), however, is not to be realised  by seeing [things this way]. Lord of Lanka, let it be so with the  ignorant who follow the particularised aspect of existence that there  are such objects as jars, etc., but it is not so with the wise. One  flame of uniform nature rises up depending on houses, mansions, parks,  and terraces, and burns them down; while a difference in the flames is  seen according to the power of each burning material which varies in  length, magnitude, etc. This being so, why (<a name="18"><strong>18</strong></a>)  is it not to be so understood? The duality of dharma and adharma thus  comes into existence. Not only is there seen a fire-flame spreading out  in one continuity and yet showing a variety of flames, but from one  seed, Lord of Lanka, are produced, also in one continuity, stems,  shoots, knots, leaves, petals, flowers, fruit, branches, all  individualised. As it is with every external object from which grows [a  variety of] objects, so also with internal objects. From ignorance there  develop the Skandhas, Dhatus, Ayatanas, with all kinds of objects  accompanying, which grow out in the triple world where we have, as we  see, happiness, form, speech, and behaviour, each differentiating  [infinitely]. The oneness of the Vijnana is grasped variously according  to the evolution of an objective world; thus there are seen things  inferior, superior, and middling, things defiled and free from  defilement, things good and bad. Not only, Lord of Lanka, is there such a  difference of conditions in things generally, there is also seen a  variety of realisations attained innerly by each Yogin as he treads the  path of discipline which constitutes his practice. How much more  difference in dharma and adharma do we not see in a world of particulars  which is evolved by discrimination? Indeed, we do. 
 
"Lord of Lanka, the differentiation of dharma and adharma comes from  discrimination. Lord of Lanka, what are dharmas? That is, they are  discriminated by the discriminations cherished by the philosophers,  Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and ignorant people. They think that the  dharmas headed by quality and substance are produced by causes—[these  are the notions] to be abandoned. Such are not to be regarded [as real]  because they are appearances (<em>lakshana</em>). It comes from one's  clinging [to appearances] that the manifestations of his own Mind are  regarded as reality (<em>dharmata</em>). (<a name="19"><strong>19</strong></a>) Such  things as jars, etc., are products of discrimination conceived by the  ignorant, they exist not; their substances are not attainable. The  viewing of things from this viewpoint is known as their abandonment. 
 
"What, then, are adharmas? Lord of Lanka, [dharmas] are unattainable  as to their selfhood, they are not appearances born of discrimination,  they are above causality; there is in them no such [dualistic] happening  as is seen as reality and non-reality. This is known as the abandoning  of dharmas. What again is meant by the unattainability of dharmas? That  is, it is like horns of a hare, or an ass, or a camel, or a horse, or a  child conceived by a barren woman. They are dharmas the nature of which  is unattainable; they are not to be thought [as real] because they are  appearances. They are only talked About in popular parlance if they have  any sense at all; they are not to be adhered to as in the case of jars,  etc. As these [unrealities] are to be abandoned as not comprehensible  by the mind (<em>vijnana</em>), so are things (<em>bhava</em>) of  discrimination also to be abandoned. This is called the abandoning of  dharmas and adharmas. Lord of Lanka, your question as to the way of  abandoning dharmas and adharmas is hereby answered. 
 
"Lord of Lanka, thou sayest again that thou hast asked [this  question] of the Tathagatas of the past who were Arhats and  Fully-Enlightened Ones and that it was solved by them. Lord of Lanka,  that which is spoken of as the past belongs to discrimination; as the  past is thus a discriminated [idea], even so are the [ideas] of the  future and the present. Because of reality (<em>dharmata</em>) the  Tathagatas do not discriminate, they go beyond discrimination and futile  reasoning, they do not follow (<a name="20"><strong>20</strong></a>) the  individuation-aspect of forms (<em>rupa</em>) except when [reality] is  disclosed for the edification of the unknowing and for the sake of their  happiness._1_ It is by transcendental wisdom (<em>prajna</em>)  that the Tathagata performs deeds transcending forms (<em>animittacara</em>);  therefore, what constitutes the Tathagatas in essence as well as in  body is wisdom (<em>jnana</em>). They do not discriminate, nor are  they discriminated. Wherefore do they not discriminate the Manas?  Because discrimination is of the self, of soul, of personality. How do  they not discriminate? The Manovijnana is meant for the objective world  where causality prevails as regards forms, appearances, conditions, and  figures. Therefore, discrimination and non-discrimination must be  transcended. 
 
_1_ This is one of the most important sections in this first  introductory chapter, but singularly all the three texts, perhaps  excepting T'ang, present some difficulties for clear understanding. Wei:  "Lord of Lanka, what you speak of as past is a form of discrimination,  and so are the future and the present, also of discrimination. Lord of  Lanka, when I speak of the real nature of suchness as being real, it  also belongs to discrimination; it is like discriminating forms as the  ultimate limit. If one wishes to realise the bliss of real wisdom, let  him discipline himself in the knowledge that transcends forms;  therefore, do not discriminate the Tathagatas as having knowledge-body  or wisdom-essence. Do not cherish any discrimination in [thy] mind. Do  not cling in [thy] will to such notions as ego, personality, soul, etc.  How not to discriminate? It is in the Manovijnana that various  conditions are cherished such as forms, figures, [etc. ]; do not cherish  such [discriminations]. Do not discriminate nor be discriminated.  Further, Lord of Lanka, it is like various forms painted on the wall,  all sentient beings are such. Lord of Lanka, all sentient beings are  like grasses and trees, with them there are no acts, no deeds, Lord of  Lanka, all dharmas and adharmas, of them nothing is heard, nothing  talked...." T'ang: "Lord of Lanka, what you speak of as past is no more  than discrimination, so is the future; I too am like him. [Is this to be  read, "the present, too, is like it"!] Lord of Lanka, the teaching of  all the Buddhas is outside discrimination; as it goes beyond all  discriminations and futile reasonings, it is not a form of  particularisation, it is realised only by wisdom. That [this absolute]  teaching is at all discoursed about is for the sake of giving bliss to  all sentient beings. The discoursing is done by the wisdom transcending  forms. It is called the Tathagata; therefore, the Tathagata has his  essence, his body in this wisdom. He thus does not discriminate, nor is  he to be discriminated. Do not discriminate him after the notion of ego,  personality, or being. Why this impossibility of discrimination?  because the Manovijnana is aroused on account of an objective world  wherein it attaches itself to forms and figures. Therefore, [the  Tathagata] is outside the discriminating [view] as well as the  discriminated [idea]. Lord of Lanka, it is like beings painted in  colours on a wall, they have no sensibility [or intelligence]. Sentient  beings in the world are also like them; no acts, no rewards [are with  them]. So are all the teachings, no hearing, no preaching." 
 
"Lord of Lanka, beings are appearances, they are like figures painted  on the wall, they have no sensibility [or consciousness]. Lord of  Lanka, all that is in the world is devoid of work and action because all  things have no reality, and there is nothing heard, nothing hearing.  Lord of Lanka, all that is in the world is like an image magically  transformed. This is not comprehended by the philosophers and the  ignorant. Lord of Lanka, he who thus sees things, is the one who sees  truthfully. Those who see things otherwise walk in discrimination; as  they depend on discrimination, they cling to dualism. It is like seeing  one's own image reflected in a mirror, or one's own shadow in the water,  or in the moonlight, or seeing one's shadow in the house, or hearing an  echo in the valley. People grasping their own shadows of discrimination  (<a name="21"><strong>21</strong></a>) uphold the discrimination of dharma and  adharma and, failing to carry out the abandonment of the dualism, they  go on discriminating and never attain tranquillity, By tranquillity is  meant oneness (<em>ekagra</em>), and oneness gives birth to the highest  Samadhi, which is gained by entering into the womb of Tathagatahood,  which is the realm of noble wisdom realised in one's inmost self." 
 
The First Chapter Called "Ravana Asking for Instruction."_1_ 
 
_1_ It is noteworthy that the chapter endings are not the  same throughout the entire text. Generally, reference is made to the  Sutra itself at the end of a chapter, stating that the chapter bears  such a title belonging to such a Sutra. But in the present case there is  no mention at all of the <em>Lankavatara Sutra</em> as if this Ravana  section were something quite independent. While there is no doubt about  its being a later addition, seeing what a complete piece of narrative it  forms by itself, and again seeing that the rest of the text makes no  further reference to Ravana, the trend of the discourse as presented by  the Buddha shows that it is closely related to the Sutra, especially  when it emphasises at the end the importance of self-realisation against  the inanity or futility of the verbal teaching ordinarily given out by a  master.

(<a name="22"><strong>22</strong></a>) At that time Mahamati the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva who had visited all the Buddha-lands, together  with all the Bodhisattvas, rose from his seat by the power of the  Buddhas, drawing his upper garment over one shoulder, placing his right  knee on the ground and with folded hands, turning in the direction of  the Blessed One, respectfully saluted him, and praised him with the  following verses: 
 
1. As thou reviewest the world with thy transcendental knowledge and  compassion, it is to thee like an ethereal flower, of which one cannot  say whether it is born or destroyed, as [the category of] being and  non-being is inapplicable to it. 
 
2. As thou reviewest all things with thy transcendental knowledge and  compassion, they are to thee like visions, they are beyond the reach of  intellectual grasp, as [the category of] being and non-being is  inapplicable to them. 
 
3. As thou reviewest the world with thy transcendental knowledge and  compassion, it is to thee always like a dream, of which one cannot say  whether it is permanent or destructible, as [the category of] being and  non-being is inapplicable to it. 
 
4. In the Dharmakaya, whose self-nature is like a vision or a dream,  what is there to praise? When no thought arises as to existence or as to  not-having-self-nature, then there is praise. 
 
5. Of a thing whose appearance is not visible because of its being  beyond the senses and their objects (<a name="23"><strong>23</strong></a>), how  can it be praised or blamed, O Muni? 
 
_1_ This division is made by the translator to facilitate  the understanding of the text in which divers subjects are promiscuously  treated. 
 
6. With thy transcendental knowledge and compassion which are above  form, thou comprehendest the egolessness of things and persons, and art  thyself always clean and free from the hindrances of passion and  knowledge. 
 
7. Thou dost not vanish in Nirvana, nor is Nirvana abiding in thee;  for it transcends the duality of knowing and known and of being and  non-being. 
 
8. Those who see the Muni so serene and beyond birth [and death] will  be cleansed of attachment, stainless both in this world and in the  other.

At that time Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva praising the Blessed  One with such verses as these, made his own name known to the Blessed  One. 
 
9. I am Mahamati, Blessed One, and am well versed in the Mahayana. I  wish to ask one hundred and eight questions of thee who art most  eloquent. 
 
10. Hearing his words the Buddha, the best knower of the world,  looking over the whole assembly, spoke to the son of the Sugata thus: 
 
11. Ask me, sons of the Victorious, and Mahamati, you ask and I will  instruct you in self-realisation. 
 
At that moment Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva who was given by  the Blessed One the opportunity to speak, prostrated himself at the feet  of the Blessed One and asked:

98._1_ I will instruct you as regards realisation and its  teaching; listen to me intently; I will give you an explanation of the  statements, O son, listen to me, in regard to the one hundred and eight  statements as recounted by the Buddhas. 
 
At that moment Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said to the  Blessed One: What is meant by the one hundred and eight statements?_2_ 
 
_1_ This verse is probably to be separated from the  foregoing ones as it forms a sort of introduction to what follows. The  one hundred and eight questions (<em>prasna</em>) so called are not to be  necessarily identified with the one hundred and eight statements (<em>pada</em>)  which are uniformely negated in the paragraph that comes after. Some  subjects are common to the Questions and the Negations, but others are  not. I do not think there is any organic relationship between the two  sections. What strikes one in both the Questions and the Negations is  that trivial subjects are mixed up with important ones as equally  constituting the content of self-realisation. The Sutra proper which is  supposed to concern itself with them is also devoid of an intimate  connection with them. 
 
_2_ Here is one of the most mysterious and unintelligible  portions of the <em>Lankavatura Sutra.</em> The Sanskrit word for  "statement" is <em>pada,</em> which literally means, "foot-step," "a  footing," "a position," "a subject," "an abode," "a matter of talk," "a  portion of a line in a stanza," etc. For the Sanskrit <em>pada</em> the  Chinese translators have "句",  "見", "位", "住",  but as they stand these translations do not give any sense to the  general context. 句 is perhaps the best in retaining  the original sense, but it is to be understood in the sense of "a  proposition," "a statement," and each sentence containing this word in  the following negations means that each subject referred to is not  properly conceived, because, for instance, the concept of birth is not  in accordance with the true understanding of reality. Birth stands  against death, they are relative notions, and do not apply to a world  where things are perceived in their absolute aspect. Therefore, any  statement that might be made concerning birth are not at all true; birth  is no-birth, death is no-death, and so on. Even of such notions as  truth, realisation, self-nature, mind, paramitas, the same can be said;  to make a statement about anything is to falsify it. Hence the series of  negations as illustrated here. But the mysterious fact about them is  the reference to so many trite subjects which are evidently in no direct  connection with the teachings of the Mahayana. There must be something  historical about these references of which the translator is at present  quite ignorant. Another mystery here concerns the number of <em>padas:</em> why 108, and not more or less? 
 
The Blessed One said: A statement concerning birth is no statement  concerning birth; a statement concerning eternity is no statement  concerning eternity. [The topics thus negated are as follows:_1_]  the characteristic marks, abiding and changing, moment, self-nature,  emptiness, annihilation, mind, the middle, permanence, causation, cause,  the passions, desire, (<a name="35"><strong>35</strong></a>) means, contrivance,  purity, inference [or conclusion], illustration, a disciple, a master, a  family, the triple vehicle, imagelessness, vows, the triple circle,  form, duality of being and non-being, bothness, the noble wisdom of  self-realisation, the bliss of the present world, lands, atoms, water, a  bow, reality, numbers and mathematics, the psychic powers, the sky,  clouds, the arts and crafts and sciences, the wind, the earth, thinking,  thought-constructions, self-nature, the aggregates, being, insight,  Nirvana, that which is known, the philosophers, disorder, a vision, a  dream, (<a name="36"><strong>36</strong></a>) a mirage, a reflection, a circle  made in the dark by a fire-brand, the city of the Gandharvas, the  heavens, food and drink, sexuality, philosophical views, the Paramitas,  morality, the moon and the sun and stars, truth, effect, annihilation  and origination, medical treatment, the characteristic marks, the limbs,  arts and sciences, Dhyana, error, the seen [world], protection,  dynasty, Rishi, kingdom, apprehension, treasure, explanation, the  Icchantika, man, woman, and hermaphrodite, taste, action, the body,  false intellection, motives, sense-organs, the Samskrita,_2_ cause and effect, the Kanishtha,_3_ the seasons, a luxuriant  growth of trees, vines and shrubs, (<a name="37"><strong>37</strong></a>)  multiplicity, entering into the teaching, systems of morality, the  Bhikshus, the powers added [by the Buddha], the lutes. These are the one  hundred and eight statements recounted by the Buddhas of the past.

At that moment, Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said again to the  Blessed One: In how many ways, Blessed One, does the rise, abiding, and  ceasing of the Vijnanas take place? 
 
The Blessed One replied: There are two ways, Mahamati, in which the  rise, abiding, and ceasing of the Vijnanas take place, and this is not  understood by the philosophers. That is to say, the ceasing takes place  as regards continuation and form. In the rise of the Vijnanas, also,  these two are recognisable: the rise as regards continuation and the  rise as regards form. In the abiding, also, these two [are discernible]:  the one taking place as regards continuation and the other as regards  form. 
 
[Further,] three modes are distinguishable in the Vijnanas: (1) the  Vijnana as evolving, (2) the Vijnana as producing effects, and (3) the  Vijnana as remaining in its original nature. 
 
[Further,] Mahamati, in the Vijnanas, which are said to be eight, two  functions generally are distinguishable, the perceiving and the  object-discriminating. As a mirror reflects forms, Mahamati, the  perceiving Vijna a perceives [objects]. Mahamati, between the two, the  perceiving Vijnana and the object-discriminating Vijnana, there is no  difference; they are mutually conditioning. Then, Mahamati, the  perciving Vijnana functions because of transformation's taking place [in  the mind] by reason of a mysterious habit-energy, while, Mahamati, the  object-discriminating Vijnana (<a name="38"><strong>38</strong></a>) functions  because of the mind's discriminating an objective world and because of  the habit-energy accumulated by erroneous reasoning since beginningless  time. 
 
Again, Mahamati, by the cessation of all the sense-Vijnanas is meant  the cessation of the Alayavijnana's variously accumulating habit-energy  which is generated when unrealities are discriminated. This, Mahamati,  is known as the cessation of the form-aspect of the Vijnanas. 
 
Again, Mahamati, the cessation of the continuation-aspect of the  Vijnanas takes place in this wise: that is to say, Mahamati, when both  that which supports [the Vijnanas] and that which is comprehended [by  the Vijnanas] cease to function. By that which supports [the Vijnanas]  is meant the habit-energy [or memory] which has been accumulated by  erroneous reasoning since beginningless time; and by that which is  comprehended [by the Vijnanas] is meant the objective world perceived  and discriminated by the Vijnanas, which is, however, no more than Mind  itself. 
 
Mahamati, it is like a lump of clay and the particles of dust making  up its substance, they are neither different nor not-different; again,  it is like gold and various ornaments made of it. If, Mahamati, the lump  of clay is different from its particles of dust, no lump will ever come  out of them. But as it comes out of them it is not different from the  particles of dust. Again, if there is no difference between the two, the  lump will be indistinguishable from its particles. 
 
Even so, Mahamati, if the evolving Vijnana are different from the  Alayavijnana, even in its original form, the Alaya cannot be their  cause. Again, if they are not different the cessation of the evolving  Vijnanas will mean the cessation of the Alayavijnana, but there is no  cessation of its original form. Therefore, Mahamati, what ceases to  function is not the Alaya in its original self-form, but is the  effect-producing form of the Vijnanas. When this original self-form  ceases to exist, then there will indeed be the cessation of the  Alayavijnana. (<a name="39"><strong>39</strong></a>) If, however, there is the  cessation of the Alayavijnana, this doctrine will in no wise differ from  the nihilistic doctrine of the philosophers. 
 
This doctrine, Mahamati, as it is held by the philosophers, is this:  When the grasping of an objective world ceases the continuation of the  Vijnanas is stopped; and when there is no more of this continuation in  the Vijnanas, the continuation that has been going on since  beginningless time is also destroyed. Mahamati, the philosophers  maintain that there is a first cause from which continuation takes  place; they do not maintain that the eye-Vijnana arises from the  interaction of form and light; they assume another cause. What is this  cause, Mahamati? Their first cause is known as spirit (<em>pradhana</em>),  soul (<em>purusha</em>), lord (<em>isvara</em>), time, or atom.

Again, Mahamati, there are seven kinds of self-nature: collection (<em>samudaya</em>),  being (<em>bhava</em>), characteristic marks (<em>lakshana</em>), elements (<em>mahabhuta</em>),  causality (<em>hetu</em>), conditionality (<em>pratyaya</em>), and  perfection (<em>nishpatti</em>)._1_ 
 
<a name="VI">

</a> 
 
Again, Mahamati, there are seven kinds of first principle [or highest  reality, <em>paramartha</em>]: the world of thought (<em>citta-gocara</em>),  the world of knowledge (<em>jnana-</em>), the world of super-knowledge (<em>prajna-</em>),  the world of dualistic views (<em>drishti-</em>), the world beyond  dualistic views, the world beyond the Bodhisattva-stages, and a world  where the Tathagata attains his self-realisation._2_ 
 
_1_ What is exactly meant by these concepts regarded as  self-nature (<em>svabhava</em>) is difficult to define as far as the <em>Lankavatara</em> is concerned. 
 
_2_ These seven principles or realities are not explained in  the text. But we can state that they are so many different kinds of  Paramartha, as in the case of Svabhava, so considered by different  schools of philosophers or Buddhists. 
 
(<a name="40"><strong>40</strong></a>) Mahamati, this is the self-nature, the  first principle, the essence, which constitutes the being of the  Tathagatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones of the past, present, and  future, whereby, perfecting things of this world and of a world beyond  this, they, by means of a noble eye of transcendental wisdom, enter into  various phases of existence, individual and general, and establish  them. And what is thus established by them is not to be confused with  the erroneous teachings generally held by the philosophers. 
 
Mahamati, what are these erroneous teachings accepted generally by  the philosophers? [Their error lies in this] that they do not recognise  an objective world to be of Mind itself which is erroneously  discriminated; and, not understanding the nature of the Vijnanas which  are also no more than manifestations of Mind, like simple-minded ones  that they are, they cherish the dualism of being and non-being where  there is but [one] self-nature and [one] first principle. 
 
Again, Mahamati, my teaching consists in the cessation of sufferings  arising from the discrimination of the triple world; in the cessation of  ignorance, desire, deed, and causality; and in the recognition that an  objective world, like a vision, is the manifestation of Mind itself.

Mahamati, there are some Brahmans and Sramanas who assume something  out of nothing, saying that there exists a substance which is bound up  in causation and abides in time, and that the Skandhas, Dhatus, and  Ayatanas have their genesis and continuation in causation and, after  thus existing, pass away. 
 
They are those, Mahamati, who hold a destructive and nihilistic view  concerning such subjects as continuation, activity, rising, breaking-up,  existence, Nirvana, the path, karma, fruition, and truth. (<a name="41"><strong>41</strong></a>)  Why? Because they have not attained an intuitive understanding [of the  Truth], because they have no fundamental insight of things. Mahamati, it  is like a jar broken in pieces which is unable to function as a jar;  again, it is like a burnt seed which is incapable of sprouting. Even so,  Mahamati, their Skandhas, Dhatus, and Ayatanas which they regard as  subject to changes are really incapable of uninterrupted transformation  because their views do not originate from the perception of an objective  world as a manifestation of Mind itself which is erroneously  discriminated. 
 
If again, Mahamati, something comes out of nothing and there is the  rise of the Vijnanas by reason of a combination of the three  effect-producing causes, we can say the same of a non-existing thing,  that a tortoise would grow hair and sands produce oil. [As this is  impossible] this proposition does not avail, it ends in affirming  nothing. And, Mahamati, it follows that deed, work, and cause [of which  they speak] will be of no use, and so also with their reference to being  and non-being. Mahamati, when they argue that there is a combination of  the three effect-producing causes, they do this by the principle of  cause and effect [which is to say, by the principle that something comes  out of something and not of nothing]; and thus there are [such things  as] past, present, and future, and being and non-being. As long as they  remain on their philosophic ground, their demonstration will be by means  of their logic and text-books, for the memory of erroneous intellection  will ever cling to them. _1 _Thus, Mahamati, simple-minded  ones, poisoned by an erroneous view, declare the incorrect way of  thinking taught by the ignorant to be the one presented by the  All-Knowing One. 
 
_1_ The reasoning here may be a little difficult to follow.  The general idea maintained by the <em>Lankavatara</em> is that as long as  a world of relativity is asserted there is an ever-recurring chain of  causation which cannot be denied in any circumstance. In this case we  cannot talk of anything coming to an end or cessation. The fault with  the philosophers is that they have no fundamental intuition into the  essential nature of an objective world—a world of particulars—which is  really the projection of mind by reason of memory or the habit-energy  accumulated since beginningless time. When this thought is thoroughly  grasped, the philosopher's point of view may also hold good as far as it  goes. As they lack, however, the fundamental intuition, all the logical  superstructure they build is essentially an error. 
 
Again, Mahamati, there are some Brahmans and Sramanas who (<a name="42"><strong>42</strong></a>) recognising that the external world which is of  Mind itself is seen as such owing to the discrimination and false  intellection practised since beginningless time, know that the world has  no self-nature and has never been born, it is like a cloud, a ring  produced by a firebrand, the castle of the Gandharvas, a vision, a  mirage, the moon as reflected in the ocean, and a dream; that Mind in  itself has nothing to do with discrimination and causation, discourses  of imagination, and terms of qualification <em>(lakshya-lakshana);</em> that body, property, and abode are objectifications of the Alayavijnana,_1_ which is in itself above [the dualism of] subject and object; that the  state of imagelessness which is in compliance with the awakening of Mind  itself,_2_ is not affected by such changes as arising,  abiding, and destruction. 
 
_1_ The translator here follows the T'ang reading. 
 
_2_ This clause does not appear in T'ang. 
 
The Bodhisattvas-Mahasattvas, Mahamati, will before long attain to  the understanding that Nirvana and Samsara are one. Their conduct,  Mahamati, will be in accordance with the effortless exhibition of a  great loving heart that ingeniously contrives means [of salvation],  knowing that all beings have the nature of being like a vision or a  reflection, and that [there is one thing which is] not bound by  causation, being beyond the distinction of subject and object; [and  further] seeing that there is nothing outside Mind, and in accordance  with a position of unconditionality, they will by degrees pass through  the various stages of Bodhisattvahood and will experience the various  states of Samadhi, and will by virtue of their faith understand that the  triple world is of Mind itself, and thus understanding will attain the  Samadhi Mayopama. The Bodhisattvas entering into the state of  imagelessness where they see into the truth of Mind-only, arriving at  the abode of the Paramitas, and keeping themselves away from the thought  of genesis, deed, and discipline, they will attain the Samadhi  Vajravimbopama which is in compliance with the Tathagatakaya and with  the transformations of suchness. After achieving a revulsion in the  abode [of the Vijnanas], Mahamati, they will gradually realise the  Tathagatakaya, which is endowed with the powers, the psychic faculties,  self-control, love, compassion, and means; which can enter into all the  Buddha-lands and into the sanctuaries of the philosophers; and which is  beyond the realm of (<a name="43"><strong>43</strong></a>) Citta-mano-manovijnana.  Therefore, Mahamati, these Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas who wish, by  following the Tathagatakaya, to realise it, should exercise themselves,  in compliance with the truth of Mind-only, to desist from discriminating  and reasoning erroneously on such notions as Skandhas, Dhatus,  Ayatanas, thought, causation, deed, discipline, and rising, abiding, and  destruction.

Perceiving that the triple existence is by reason of the habit-energy  of erroneous discrimination and false reasoning that has been going on  since beginningless time, and also thinking of the state of Buddhahood  which is imageless and unborn, [the Bodhisattva] will become thoroughly  conversant with the noble truth of self-realisation, will become a  perfect master of his own mind, will conduct himself without effort,  will be like a gem reflecting a variety of colours, will be able to  assume the body of transformation, will be able to enter into the subtle  minds of all beings, and, because of his firm belief in the truth of  Mind-only, will, by gradually ascending the stages, become established  in Buddhahood. Therefore, Mahamati, let the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva be  well disciplined in self-realisation.

Then Mahamati said: Teach me, Blessed One, concerning that most  subtle doctrine which explains the Citta, Manas, Manovijnana, the five  Dharmas, the Svabhavas, and the Lakshanas; which is put in practice by  the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas; which is separated from the state of mind  which recognises a world as something outside Mind itself; and which,  breaking down all the so-called truths established by words and  reasonings, constitutes the essence of the teachings of all the Buddhas.  Pray teach this assembly headed by the Bodhisattvas gathering on Mount  Malaya in the city of Lanka; teach them regarding the Dharmakaya which  is praised by the Tathagatas and which is the realm of (<a name="44"><strong>44</strong></a>)  the Alayavijnana which resembles the ocean with its waves. Then the  Blessed One again speaking to Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said  this: The reasons whereby the eye-consciousness arises are four. What  are they? They are: (1) The clinging to an external world, not knowing  that it is of Mind itself; (2) The attaching to form and habit-energy  accumulated since beginningless time by false reasoning and erroneous  views; (3) The self-nature inherent in the Vijnana; (4) The eagerness  for multiple forms and appearances. By these four reasons, Mahamati, the  waves of the evolving Vijnanas are stirred on the Alayavijnana which  resembles the waters of a flood. The same [can be said of the other  sense-consciousnesses] as of the eye-consciousness. This consciousness  arises at once or by degrees in every sense-organ including its atoms  and pores of the skin; the sense-field is apprehended like a mirror  reflecting objects, like the ocean swept over by a wind. Mahamati,  similarly the waves of the mind-ocean are stirred uninterruptedly by the  wind of objectivity; cause, deed, and appearance condition one another  inseparably; the functioning Vijnanas and the original Vijnana are thus  inextricably bound-up together; and because the self-nature of form,  etc., is not comprehended, Mahamati, the system of the five  consciousnesses (<em>vijnanas</em>) comes to function. Along with this  system of the five Vijnanas, there is what is known as Manovijnana [i.  e., the thinking function of consciousness], whereby the objective world  is distinguished and individual appearances are distinctly determined,  and in this the physical body has its genesis. But the Manovijnana and  other Vijnanas have no thought that they are mutually conditioned and  that they grow out of their attachment to the discrimination which is  applied to the projections of Mind itself. Thus the Vijnanas go on  functioning mutually related in a most intimate manner and  discriminating a world of representations. 
 
(<a name="45"><strong>45</strong></a>) As the Vijnanas thus go on functioning  [without being conscious of their own doings], so the Yogins while  entering upon a state of tranquillisation (<em>Samapatti</em>) are not  aware of the workings of the subtle habit-energy [or memory] within  themselves; for they think that they would enter upon a state of  tranquillisation by extinguishing the Vijnanas. But [in fact] they are  in this state without extinguishing the Vijnanas which still subsist  because the seeds of habit-energy have not been extinguished; and [what  they imagine to be] an extinction is really the non-functioning of the  external world to which they are no more attached. So it is, Mahamati,  with the subtle working of the Alayavijnana, which, except for the  Tathagata and those Bodhisattvas who are established on the stages, is  not easy to comprehend; [especially] by those who practise the  discipline belonging to the Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and philosophers,  even with their powers of Samadhi and transcendental knowledge, it is  difficult to distinguish. Only those who, understanding fully all the  aspects of the different stages of Bodhisattvahood by the aid of their  transcendental knowledge, acquiring a definite cognition as regards the  meaning of the separate propositions, planting roots of goodness in the  Buddha-lands that know no limits, and keeping themselves away from the  discriminations and false reasonings that arise from recognising an  external world which is of Mind itself, would retire into a secluded  abode in the forest and devote themselves to the practice of the  spiritual discipline, either high, or low, or middling, only those are  capable of obtaining an insight into the flowing of Mind itself in a  world of discrimination, of being baptised by the Buddhas living in the  lands without limits, and of realising the self-control, powers, psychic  faculties, and Samadhis. Surrounded by good friends and the Buddhas,  Mahamati, they are capable of knowing the Citta, Manas, Manovijnana,  which are the discriminating agents of an external world whose  self-nature is of Mind itself; they are capable of crossing the ocean of  birth and death which arises by reason of deed, desire, and ignorance.  For this reason, Mahamati, the Yogins ought to exercise themselves in  the discipline which has been given them by their good friends and the  Buddhas. 
 
(<a name="46"><strong>46</strong></a>) At that time the Blessed One recited the  following verses: 
 
99. Like waves that rise on the ocean stirred by the wind, dancing  and without interruption, 
 
100. The Alaya-ocean in a similar manner is constantly stirred by the  winds of objectivity, and is seen dancing about with the Vijnanas which  are the waves of multiplicity. 
 
101. Dark-blue, red, [and other colours], with salt, conch-shell,  milk, honey, fragrance of fruits and flowers, and rays of sunlight; 
 
102. They are neither different nor not-different: the relation is  like that between the ocean and its waves. So are the seven Vijnanas  joined with the Citta (mind). 
 
103. As the waves in their variety are stirred on the ocean, so in  the Alaya is produced the variety of what is known as the Vijnanas. 
 
104. The Citta, Manas, and Vijnanas are discriminated as regards  their form; [but in substance] the eight are not to be separated one  from another, for there is neither qualified nor qualifying. 
 
105. As there is no distinction between the ocean and its waves, so  in the Citta there is no evolution of the Vijnanas. 
 
106. Karma is accumulated by the Citta, reflected upon by the Manas,  and recognised by the Manovijnana, and the visible world is  discriminated by the five Vijnanas. 
 
(<a name="47"><strong>47</strong></a>) 107. Varieties of colour such as  dark-blue, etc., are presented to our Vijnana. Tell me, Great Muni, how  there are these varieties of colour like waves [on the ocean]? 
 
108. There are no such varieties of colour in the waves; it is for  the sake of the simple-minded that the Citta is said to be evolving as  regards form. 
 
109. There is no such evolving in the Citta itself, which is beyond  comprehension. Where there is comprehension there is that which  comprehends as in the case of waves [and ocean]. 
 
110. Body, property, and abode are presented as such to our Vijnanas,  and thus they are seen as evolving in the same way as are the waves. 
 
111. The ocean is manifestly seen dancing in the state of waveness;  how is it that the evolving of the Alaya is not recognised by the  intellect even as the ocean is?_1_ 
 
112. That the Alaya is compared to the ocean is [only] for the sake  of the discriminating intellect of the ignorant; the likeness of the  waves in motion is [only] brought out by way of illustration. 
 
113. When the sun rises it shines impartially on people high and low;  so thou who art the light of the world shouldst announce the truth (<em>tattvam</em>)  to the ignorant. 
 
(<a name="48"><strong>48</strong></a>) 114. How is it that in establishing  thyself in the Dharma thou announcest not the truth? If the truth is  announced by me, the truth is not in the mind._2_ 
 
115. As the waves appear instantly on the ocean, or [images] in a  mirror or a dream, so the mind is reflected in its own sense-fields._3_ 
 
116. Owing to a deficiency in conditions the evolution [of the  Vijnanas] takes place by degrees._4_ The function of the  Manovijnana is to recognise and that of the Manas is to reflect upon, 
 
117. While to the five Vijnanas the actual world presents itself.  There is no gradation when one is in a state of collectedness (<em>samahita</em>)._5_ Like unto a master of painting or his pupils, 
 
_1_ This question according to Sung and T'ang is Mahamati's. 
 
_2_ 113 and the first part of 114 are ascribed to Mahamati  in Sung and T'ang, but Wei gives both 113 and 114 to Mahamati. 
 
_3_ This must have found its way here by mistake, for the  ocean-waves simile in this text is generally used to illustrate the  Alaya's relation to the other Vijnanas, and not in connection with the  immediacy of perception as in this case of the mirror-images simile. 
 
_4_ This ought to belong to the preceding verse. Not  wishing, however, to disturb the original notation, the translator has  followed the text. In that which follows, the reader is asked simply to  look for the sense and to pay no attention to the division of verses. 
 
_5_ <em>Samahita, Samadhi, Samapatti, ekagra</em> may be  understood as synonymous, denoting a state of consciousness where the  mind is most intensely concentrated on one thought. It is the receptive  state of intuition, rather than the active state of thinking. 
 
118._1_ Who arrange colours to produce a picture, I teach.  The picture is not in the colours, nor in the canvas, nor in the plate; 
 
119. In order to make it attractive to all beings, a picture is  presented in colours. What one teaches, transgresses; for the truth (<em>tattva</em>)  is beyond words. 
 
120. Establishing myself in the Dharma, I preach the truth for the  Yogins. The truth is the state of self-realisation and is beyond  categories of discrimination. 
 
121. I teach it to the sons of the Victorious; the teaching is not  meant for the ignorant. What is seen as multitudinous is a vision which  exists not. 
 
122. The teaching itself is thus variously given, subject to  transgression; (<a name="49"><strong>49</strong></a>) the teaching is no teaching  whatever if it is not to the point in each case. 
 
123. According to the nature of a disease the healer gives its  medicine; even so the Buddhas teach beings in accordance with their  mentalities. 
 
124. This is indeed not a mental realm to be reached by the  philosophers and the Sravakas; what is taught by the leaders is the  realm of self-realisation.

Further, Mahamati, if the Bodhisattva should wish to understand fully  that an external world to be subsumed under categories of  discrimination, such as the grasping (subject) and the grasped (object),  is of Mind itself, let him be kept away from such hindrances as  turmoil, social intercourse, and sleep; let him be kept away from the  treatises and writings of the philosophers, from things belonging to the  vehicles of Sravakahood and Pratyekabuddhahood; let the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva be thoroughly acquainted with objects of  discrimination which are to be seen as of Mind itself. 
 
### XI(a) 
 
Further, Mahamati, when the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva establishes  himself in the abode where he has gained a thorough understanding of  Mind by means of his transcendental knowledge, he should later  discipline himself in the cultivation of noble wisdom in its triple  aspect. What are the three aspects of noble wisdom, Mahamati, in which  he has to discipline himself later? They are: (1) imagelessness; (2) the  power added by all the Buddhas by reason of their original vows; and  (3) the self-realisation attained by noble wisdom. Having mastered them,  (<a name="50"><strong>50</strong></a>) the Yogin should abandon his knowledge of  Mind gained by means of transcendental wisdom, which still resembles a  lame donkey; and entering upon the eighth stage of Bodhisattvahood, he  should further discipline himself in these three aspects of noble  wisdom. 
 
Then again, Mahamati, the aspect of imagelessness comes forth when  all things belonging to the Sravakas and Pratyekabuddhas and  philosophers are thoroughly mastered. Again, Mahamati, as to the power  added, it comes from the original vows made by all the Buddhas. Again,  Mahamati, as to the self-realisation aspect of noble wisdom, it rises  when a Bodhisattva, detaching himself from viewing all things in their  phenomenality, realises the Samadhi-body whereby he surveys the world as  like unto a vision, and further goes on to the attainment of the  Buddha-stage. Mahamati, this is the triplicity of the noble life.  Furnished with this triplicity, noble ones will attain the state of  self-realisation which is the outcome of noble wisdom. For this reason,  Mahamati, you should cultivate noble wisdom in its triple aspect. 
 
### XI(b) 
 
At that moment, Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva knowing what was  going on in the minds of the Bodhisattvas who were gathered there, and  empowered by the power added to him by all the Buddhas, asked the  Blessed One concerning the doctrine known as examining into the reality  of noble wisdom. Tell me, Blessed One, the doctrine of examining into  the reality of noble wisdom, depending on which the one hundred and  eight statements are to be distinguished—the doctrine depending on which  the Tathagatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones will analyse and  disclose the nature and course of false imagination for the sake of (<a name="51"><strong>51</strong></a>) the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas who have fallen  into the way of looking at things from their aspects of generality and  individuality. Thus the Bodhisattvas will be instructed in the analysis  and thorough examination of false imagination, and thereby they will  have the passage purified which leads to the egolessness of things and  persons, and get an illumination on the stages of Bodhisattvahood; and,  further, going beyond the bliss of the tranquillisations_1_ belonging to all the Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and philosophers, will  attain the Dharmakaya of the Tathagata, which belongs to the realm and  course of Tathagatahood transcending thought and in which there is no  rising of the five Dharmas. That is to say, they will attain the  Tathagata-body which is the Dharma intimately bound up with the  understanding born of transcendental knowledge, and which, entering into  the realm of Maya, reaches all the Buddha-lands, the heavenly mansions  of Tushita, and the abode of the Akanishtha. 
 
_1_ That is, <em>dhyana, Samadhi</em> and <em>Samapatti,</em> which practically belong to the same category.

Said the Blessed One: Mahamati, there are some philosophers who are  addicted to negativism, according to whose philosophical view the  non-existence of the hare's horns is ascertained by means of the  discriminating intellect which affirms that the self-nature of things  ceases to exist with the destruction of their causes; and they say that  all things are non-existent just like the hare's horns. 
 
Again, Mahamati, there are others who, seeing distinctions existing  in things as regards the elements, qualities, atoms, substances,  formations, and positions, and, attached to the notion that the hare's  horns are non-existent, assert that the bull has horns. 
 
There are, Mahamati, those who have fallen into the dualistic way of  thinking, being unable to comprehend the truth of Mind-only; they desire  to discriminate a world which is of Mind itself. Mahamati, body,  property, and abode have their existence only when measured in  discrimination. (<a name="52"><strong>52</strong></a>) The hare's horns neither  are nor are not; no discrimination is to be made about them. So it is,  Mahamati, with all things, of which neither being nor non-being can be  predicated; have no discrimination about them! 
 
Again, Mahamati, those who have gone beyond being and non-being, no  more cherish the thought that the hare has no horns; for they never  think that the hare has no horns because of mutual reference, nor do  they think that the bull has horns because no ultimate substance is to  be obtained however minutely the analysis of the horns may go on even to  the subtlest particle known as atom: [that is,] the state in which  noble wisdom is realised is beyond being and non-being. 
 
At that time Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said this to the  Blessed One: Is it not this way, Blessed One, that, seeing how  discrimination takes place, we proceed to refer this to the non-rising  of discrimination and infer that the horns exist not? 
 
The Blessed One said: No, indeed, Mahamati, the non-existence of the  horns has no reference to the non-rising of discrimination. Why is it  not so? Because there is discrimination owing to the idea of the horns.  Indeed, depending upon the idea of the horns, Mahamati, discrimination  takes place. And because of this dependence of discrimination upon the  idea of the horns, Mahamati, and because of this relationship of  dependence and apart from the <em>anyananya</em>_1_ relationship,  one talks of the non-existence of the hare's horns, surely not because  of the reference [to the horns of the bull]. If again, Mahamati,  discrimination is different (<em>anya</em>) from the hare's horns, (<a name="53"><strong>53</strong></a>) it will not take place by reason of the horns  [and therefore the one is not different from the other]; but if it is  not different (<em>ananya</em>), there is a discrimination taking place by  reason of the horns [and therefore the one is different from the  other]. However minutely the atoms are analysed, no horn [-substance] is  obtainable; the notion of the horns itself is not available when thus  reasoned. As neither of them [that is, the bull's nor the hare's] are  existent, in reference to what should we talk of non-existence?  Therefore, Mahamati, the reasoning by reference as regards the  non-existence of the hare's horns is of no avail. The non-existence of  the hare's horns is asserted in reference to their existence [on the  bull; but really a horn itself has no existence from the beginning];  have therefore no discrimination about it! Mahamati, the dualism of  being and non-being as held by the philosophers does not obtain as we  see in the reasoning of horns. 
 
<div>_1_ Literally different and not-different.</div> 
 
Again, Mahamati, there are other philosophers affected with erroneous  views, who are attached to such notions as form, cause, and figure; not  fully understanding the nature of space and seeing that space is  disjoined from form, they proceed to discriminate about their separate  existences. But, Mahamati, space is form, and, Mahamati, as space  penetrates into form, form is space. To establish the relation of  supporting and supported, Mahamati, there obtains the separation of the  two, space and form. Mahamati, when the elements begin to evolve [a  world] they are distinguishable one from another; they do not abide in  space, and space is not non-existent in them. 
 
It is the same with the hare's horns, Mahamati, whose non-existence  is asserted in reference to the bull's horns. But, Mahamati, when the  bull's horns are analysed to their minutest atoms, which in turn are  further analysed, there is after all nothing to be known as atoms. The  non-existence of what, is to be affirmed in reference to what? As to the  other things, too, this reasoning from reference (<a name="54"><strong>54</strong></a>)  does not hold true. 
 
At that time, again, the Blessed One said this to Mahamati the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva; Mahamati, you should discard the views and  discriminations that are concerned with the horns of a hare and a bull,  with space and form. And also, Mahamati, let you and other Bodhisattvas  reflect on the nature of discrimination which they have of the Mind  itself, and let them go into all the Bodhisattva-lands where they should  disclose the way of disciplining themselves in the manifestations of  Mind itself.

Then at that time the Blessed One recited these verses: 
 
125. The world [as we see it] exists not, pluralities of things rise  from the Mind being seen [externally]; body, property, and abode are  manifested to us as of the Alayavijnana. 
 
126. The leaders talk about the Citta, Manas, [Mano-]vijnana, the  [triple] Svabhava, the five Dharmas, the twofold egolessness, and  purification. 
 
127. Long and short, etc., exist mutually bound up; when existence is  asserted, there is non-existence, and where non-existence is asserted,  there is existence. 
 
128. Analysed down to atoms, there is indeed no form to be  discriminated as such; what can be established is the [truth of]  Mind-only, which is not believed by those who cherish erroneous views. 
 
129. This does not belong to the realm of the theoreticians nor to  that of the Sravaka; (<a name="55"><strong>55</strong></a>) the Buddhas disclose  the way of self-realisation. 
 
<a name="XIV"> 
 
### XIV 
 
</a> 
 
At that time again, Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva made a  request of the Blessed One regarding the purification of the outflow  which comes from recognising an objective world which is of Mind itself,  saying, How, O Blessed One, is the outflow purified that takes place  from recognising an external world which is of Mind itself? Is the  purification instantaneous or gradual? 
 
Replied the Blessed One: The outflow that takes place from  recognising an external world which is of Mind itself is gradually  purified and not instantaneously. Mahamati, it is like the amra fruit  which ripens gradually and not instantaneously; in the same way,  Mahamati, the purification of beings_1_ is gradual and not  instantaneous. Mahamati, it is like the potter making pots, which is  done gradually and not instantaneously; in the same way, Mahamati, the  purification of beings by the Tathagata is gradual and not  instantaneous. Mahamati, it is like grass, shrubs, herbs, and trees,  that grow up gradually from the earth and not instantaneously; in the  same way, Mahamati, the purification by the Tathagata of beings is  gradual and not instantaneous; Mahamati, it is like the mastery of  comedy, dancing, singing, music, lute-playing, writing, and [other]  arts, which is gained gradually and not instantaneously; in the same  way, Mahamati, the purification by the Tathagata of all beings is  gradual and not instantaneous. 
 
Mahamati, it is like a mirror indiscriminately and instantaneously  reflecting in it forms and images; (<a name="56"><strong>56</strong></a>) in the  same way, Mahamati, the purification by the Tathagata of all beings is  instantaneous, who makes them free from discrimination and leads them to  the state of imagelessness. Mahamati, it is like the sun or the moon  revealing all forms instantaneously by illuminating them with its light;  in the same way, Mahamati, the Tathagata, by making all beings discard  the habit-energy which issues from the erroneous views they entertain in  regard to an external world which is of the Mind, instantaneously  reveals to all beings the realm of unthinkable knowledge which belongs  to Buddhahood. It is like the Alayavijnana making instantaneously a  world of body, property, and abode, which is what is seen of Mind  itself; in the same way, Mahamati, the Nishyanda-Buddha, instantaneously  maturing the mentality of beings, places them in the palatial abode of  the Akanishtha mansion where they will become practisers of various  spiritual exercises. Mahamati, it is like the Dharmata-Buddha shining  forth instantaneously with the rays that issue from the  Nishyanda-Nirmana [-Buddha]; in the same way, Mahamati, the noble truth  of self-realisation instantaneously shines out when the false  [dualistic] views of existence and non-existence are discarded.

<a name="XV">

</a> 
 
And yet again, Mahamati, what the Dharmata-Nishyanda-Buddha [that is,  the Buddha that flows out of the absolute Dharma] teaches is that all  things are comprehensible under the aspects of individuality and  generality, for they are bound up with causes and conditions of  habit-energy which is accumulated by not recognising an external world  as of Mind itself; that by reason of clinging to these false  imaginations there is multitudinousness of unrealities, which resemble  the various scenes and persons created magically and imagined as really  in existence. Further again, Mahamati, false imaginations arise from  clinging to the notion of relativity. To illustrate: when the magician  depending upon grass, (<a name="57"><strong>57</strong></a>) wood, shrubs, and  creepers, exercises his art, all beings and forms take shape,  magically-created persons are produced, which appear endowed with  individuality and material body, and they are variously and fancifully  discriminated. While they are thus manifesting themselves, Mahamati,  there is no substantiality in them. Likewise, Mahamati, based on the  notion of relativity the false imagination recognises a variety of  appearances which are distinguished by a discriminating mind. And as  their individual appearances are imagined and adhered to, there is  habit-energy, and, Mahamati, so long as the fancying goes on we have  here all that is needed to constitute the self-nature of the false  imagination. Mahamati, this is the discourse of the Nishyanda Buddha. 
 
Again, Mahamati, it is the doing of the Dharmata-Buddha to establish  the exalted state of self-realisation which transcends the phenomena of  the [empirical] mind. 
 
Again, Mahamati, what the Nirmita-Nirmana-Buddha [or Buddha of  transformation] establishes concerns such matters as charity, morality,  meditation, tranquillisation, various forms of transcendental knowledge  and of understanding, the Skandhas, Dhatus, and Ayatanas, emancipation,  the Vijnanas, and the ways in which they function, the forms which they  take, their distinctions and their performances. The Buddha discloses  against the philosophical views that which surpasses forms. 
 
Again Mahamati, the Dharmata-Buddha is unconditioned, free from  conditions, has nothing to do with all doings, senses, and measurements,  and does not belong to the world of the ignorant, Sravakas,  Pratyekabuddhas, and philosophers, who are always clinging to the notion  of an ego. For this reason, Mahamati, you should discipline yourself in  the excellent and exalted way leading to self-realisation; (<a name="58"><strong>58</strong></a>) you should keep yourself away from the views  that recognise the reality of an external world apart from the Mind  itself.

Further again, Mahamati, in the life of the Sravaka-vehicle, there  are two aspects to be distinguished, namely, the excellent and exalted  state of self-realisation, and the attachment to the notion of  self-nature arising from discrimination. What is the excellent, exalted  state of self-realisation belonging to the Sravakas? This is a state of  mental concentration which is attained when one realises states of  emptiness, egolessness, suffering, and impermanence, and the truth that  is free from passions and is ever serene; when one annihilates notions  belonging to the externality of things, such as the Skandhas, Dhatus,  Ayatanas, individuality and generality; and when one has an insight into  reality as it is. Entering upon this state of mental concentration the  Sravakas will attain the blissful abode of exalted self-realisation in  which there is the emancipation belonging to a Dhyana, the path and  fruit of a Samadhi, and the deliverance of a Samapatti, but in which  there is as yet no discarding of habit-energy and no escape from the  imperceivable transformation of death. This, Mahamati, is the Sravaka's  exalted state of self-realisation. Having attained this exalted and  blissful condition of self-realisation as realised by the Sravakas,  Mahamati, the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva may not enjoy by himself the bliss  of cessation, the bliss of Samapatti, but should think compassionately  of other beings and keep ever fresh his original vows. Mahamati, in  whatever exalted and blissful state of self-realisation the Bodhisattva  may find himself, he should never exert himself in the exalted and  blissful state of self-realisation as attained by the Sravakas. 
 
(<a name="59"><strong>59</strong></a>) Mahamati, what is meant by the  attachment to the notion of self-nature arising from discrimination?  This attachment takes place when a man, seeing that the elements and the  qualities such as blue, yellow, warmth, humidity, motility, and  rigidity, have never been created by a creator, yet clings to the  notions of individuality and generality in accordance with the measures  laid down in books of logic. Mahamati, the Bodhisattva, knowing what  this is, must abandon it. Conforming himself to the egolessness of  things and holding back the wrong views regarding the egolessness of a  person, the Bodhisattva should keep himself on the  continuously-ascending journey along the stages. This is the Sravaka's  attachment to the notion of self-nature arising from the discrimination  of existence. 
 
<a name="XVII">

At that time Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said this to the  Blessed One: According to the Blessed One's teaching, the  eternal-unthinkable is the exalted condition of self-realisation and  also of highest reality. Now, do not the philosophers also talk about  the creative agent being the eternal-unthinkable? 
 
The Blessed One replied: No, Mahamati, the eternal-unthinkable  considered by the philosophers to be characteristic of their creator is  untenable. Why? Because, Mahamati, the eternal-unthinkable as held by  the philosophers is not in conformity with the idea of a cause itself.  When, Mahamati, this eternal-unthinkable is not in conformity with the  idea of a cause itself how can this be proved tenable? (<a name="60"><strong>60</strong></a>)  Again, Mahamati, if what is claimed to be the eternal-unthinkable is in  conformity with the idea of a cause [which is eternal] in itself, it  can be eternal; but since the idea of a creator is based upon that of a  [further] cause, it cannot be the eternal-unthinkable. 
 
But, Mahamati, my highest reality is the eternal-unthinkable since it  conforms to the idea of a cause and is beyond existence and  non-existence. Because it is the exalted state of self-realisation it  has its own character; because it is the cause of the highest reality it  has its causation; because it has nothing to do with existence and  non-existence it is no doer; because it is to be classed under the same  head as space, Nirvana, and cessation it is eternal. Therefore,  Mahamati, it is not the same as the eternal-unthinkable of the  philosophers; the eternal-unthinkable of the Tathagatas is thatness  realised by noble wisdom within themselves. For this reason, Mahamati,  let the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva discipline himself in order to attain by  means of noble wisdom the truth of self-realisation which is the  eternal-unthinkable. 
 
Again, further, Mahamati, the eternal-unthinkable of the philosophers  is not characterised with eternality because it has a cause which is  not eternal; what they regard as eternal is not eternal as it is not  characterised with the power that can create itself. If again, Mahamati,  the philosophers prove the eternality of their eternal-unthinkable in  contradistinction to the becoming and therefore the non-eternality of  things created, Mahamati, by the same reasoning (<a name="61"><strong>61</strong></a>)  I can prove that their eternality has no reason to be known as such  just because things created are non-eternal owing to their becoming. 
 
If again, Mahamati, the eternal-unthinkable of the philosophers is in  conformity with the idea of a cause, what they regard as characteristic  of a cause is a non-entity like the horns of a hare; and, Mahamati,  their eternal-unthinkable is no more than a verbal discrimination, in  which, Mahamati, the philosophers' fault consists. Why? Because,  Mahamati, mere verbal discriminations are, indeed, the hare's horns, on  account of their having no characteristic of a self-cause. Mahamati,  moreover, my eternal-unthinkable is really eternal because it finds its  cause in the exalted state of self-realisation, and because it has  nothing to do with a creator, with being and non-being. Its eternality  is not derived from the reasoning which is based upon the external  notion of being and non-being, of eternity and non-eternity. If the  eternal-unthinkable is eternal in consideration of the non-existence and  eternality of external things, we can say of this kind of the  eternal-unthinkable that the philosophers do not know what is meant by  characteristically self-caused. As they are outside the state of  self-realisation attainable by noble wisdom, Mahamati, their discourse  is not to the point. 
 
<a name="XVIII">

Further, Mahamati, those who, afraid of sufferings arising from the  discrimination of birth-and-death, seek for Nirvana, do not know that  birth-and-death and Nirvana are not to be separated the one from the  other; and, seeing that all things subject to discrimination have no  reality, imagine that Nirvana consists in the future annihilation of the  senses and their fields. (<a name="62"><strong>62</strong></a>) They are not  aware, Mahamati, of the fact that Nirvana is the Alayavijnana where a  revulsion takes place by self-realisation. Therefore, Mahamati, those  who are stupid talk of the trinity of vehicles and not of the state of  Mind-only where there are no images. Therefore, Mahamati, those who do  not understand the teachings of the Tathagatas of the past, present, and  future, concerning the external world, which is of Mind itself, cling  to the notion that there is a world outside what is seen of the Mind  and, Mahamati, go on rolling themselves along the wheel of  birth-and-death. 
 
<a name="XIX"> 
 
### XIX 
 
</a> 
 
Further, Mahamati, according to the teaching of the Tathagatas of the  past, present, and future, all things are unborn. Why? Because they  have no reality, being manifestations of Mind itself, and, Mahamati, as  they are not born of being and non-being, they are unborn. Mahamati, all  things are like the horns of the hare, horse, donkey, or camel, but the  ignorant and simple-minded who are given up to their false and  erroneous imaginations, discriminate things where they are not;  therefore, all things are unborn. That all things are in their  self-nature unborn, Mahamati, belongs to the realm of self-realisation  attained by noble wisdom, and does not belong essentially to the realm  of dualistic discrimination cherished by the ignorant and simple-minded.  The self-nature and the characteristic marks of body, property, and  abode evolve when the Alayavijnana is conceived by the ignorant as  grasping and grasped; and then they fall into a dualistic view of  existence where they recognise its rise, abiding, and disappearance,  cherishing the idea that all things are born and subject to  discrimination as to being and non-being. (<a name="63"><strong>63</strong></a>)  Therefore, Mahamati, you should discipline yourself therein [i. e. in  self-realisation]. 
 
<a name="XX"> 
 
### XX 
 
</a> 
 
Again further, Mahamati, there are five groups of people, each of  whom attains its own [spiritual] insight. What are the five? They are:  (1) the group of people whose insight belongs to the Sravaka-vehicle;  (2) the group of people whose insight belongs to the  Pratyekabuddha-vehicle; (3) the group of people whose insight belongs to  the Tathagata-vehicle; (4) the group of indefinite character; and (5)  the group of people to whom no insight is possible. 
 
Mahamati, how does one know the group of people whose insight belongs  to the Sravaka vehicle? There are people the hair of whose body will  stand on end when they know and realise the nature of the Skandhas,  Dhatus, Ayatanas, and [what is meant by] generality and individuality;  their intellect will leap with joy on knowing and practising what  belongs to appearance and not on practising what they know of the  uninterrupted chain of causation, —such ones, Mahamati, are said to be  of the group whose insight belongs to the Sravaka vehicle. Having had an  insight into their own vehicle, they abide at the fifth or the sixth  stage where they do away with the rising of the passions, but not with  the habit-energy; they have not yet passed beyond the inconceivable  transformation-death, and their lion-roar is, "My life is destroyed, my  morality is established, etc."; they will then discipline themselves in  the egolessness of persons and finally gain the knowledge of Nirvana. 
 
Again, Mahamati, there are others who, believing in such things as  ego, being, vital principle, nourisher, supreme spirit, or personal  soul, will seek Nirvana in them. Again, Mahamati, there are still others  who, seeing that all things exist by depending upon causes, will  recognise in this the way to Nirvana. (<a name="64"><strong>64</strong></a>) But,  Mahamati, as they have no insight into the egolessness of things, there  is no emancipation for them. This, Mahamati, is where those of the  Sravaka-vehicle and the philosophers make the mistake in their insight  by regarding non-deliverance as deliverance. Therefore, Mahamati, you  ought to discipline yourself in order to escape this wrong view. 
 
Now, Mahamati, they belong to the group of the Pratyekabuddha-vehicle  who will shed tears and feel the hair of their body stand on end when  the Pratyekabuddha's insight is shown to them. When the teaching to keep  themselves away from social relations and entanglements, not to become  attached to the external world and its manifold form, to perform  miraculous powers by which they can divide their own body and appear  double or perform the transformations, is disclosed to them, they are  thereby entreated. Recognising that they are of the group whose insight  belong to the Pratyekabuddha-vehicle, their discourses will be in  conformity with the insight of the Pratyekabuddha-vehicle. This,  Mahamati, is the characteristic feature of the group of people whose  insight belongs to the Pratyekabuddha-vehicle. 
 
Now, Mahamati, three aspects are distinguishable in the insight  belonging to the group of the Tathagata-vehicle. They are: (1) an  insight whereby one sees into the self-nature of things, which is no  self-nature; (2) an exalted insight which is the attainment of  self-realisation; and (3) an insight into the immensity of the external  Buddha-lands. When, Mahamati, these three aspects are disclosed one  after another and also when the inconceivable realm of the Alayavijnana  is disclosed, where body, property, and abode are seen to be the  manifestation of Mind itself, a man will not be frightened, nor  terrified, nor show any sign of fear; then such a one is to be known as  of the group of people whose insight belongs to the Tathagata-vehicle.  This is, (<a name="65"><strong>65</strong></a>) Mahamati, the characteristic  feature of the insight of those who belong to the Tathagata-vehicle. 
 
Again, Mahamati, when these three forms of insight are disclosed to a  man, he may thereby be pursuaded to discipline himself in them. This,  Mahamati, is the stage of preparation for the establishment of his own  group. In order that he may go up to the stage of imagelessness, there  is this establishment. But the Sravaka who will purify his own  habit-energy of passions by attaining an inner perception into the Alaya  and by seeing into the egolessness of things, will settle himself in  the bliss of the Samadhi and finally will attain the body of  Tathagatahood._1_ 
 
_1_ What is stated about the group of indefinite character  is not quite clear.

Then the Blessed One recited these verses: 
 
130. The fruit of the Stream-entered, and that of the Once-to-come;  the fruit of the Not-to-come and Arhatship— all these are due to mental  perturbation. 
 
131. The triple vehicle, the one vehicle, and the no-vehicle, of  these I talk, for the sake of the dull-witted, and [also] for the wise,  solitude-loving ones. 
 
132. The gate of highest reality has nothing to do with the two forms  of thought-construction [subject and object]; Where the imageless  stands, why should we establish the triple vehicles?

Again, Mahamati, how is it that the Icchantika_1_ never  awaken the desire for emancipation? (<a name="66"><strong>66</strong></a>) Because  they have abandoned all the stock of merit, and because they cherish  certain vows for all beings since beginningless time. What is meant by  abandoning all the stock of merit? It refers to [those Buddhists] who  have abandoned the Bodhisattva collection [of the canonical texts],  making the false accusation that they are not in conformity with the  sutras, the codes of morality, and the emancipation. By this they have  forsaken all the stock of merit and will not enter into Nirvana.  Secondly again, Mahamati, there are Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas who, on  account of their original vows made for all beings, saying, "So long as  they do not attain Nirvana, I will not attain it myself," keep  themselves away from Nirvana. This, Mahamati, is the reason of their not  entering into Nirvana, and because of this they go on the way of the  Icchantika. 
 
_2_ Those who are destitute of the Buddha-nature. 
 
Again, Mahamati said; Who, Blessed One, would never enter Nirvana? 
 
The Blessed One replied: Knowing that all things are in Nirvana  itself from the very beginning, the Bodhisattva-Icchantika would never  enter Nirvana. But those Icchantikas who have forsaken all the stock of  merit [finally] do. Those Icchantikas, Mahamati, who have forsaken all  the stock of merit might some day be influenced by the power of the  Tathagatas and be induced at any moment to foster the stock of merit.  Why? Because, Mahamati, no beings are left aside by the Tathagatas. For  this reason, Mahamati, it is the Bodhisattva-Icchantika (<a name="67"><strong>67</strong></a>)  who never enters into Nirvana. 
 
<a name="XXIII">

Further, Mahamati, let the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva be well acquainted  with the three kinds of Svabhava (self-nature). [What are the three?  They are (1) false discrimination, (2) knowledge of relativity, and (3)  perfect knowledge.] Now, Mahamati, false discrimination rises from form (<em>nimitta</em>).  How, Mahamati, does it rise from form? In [the consideration of] the  relativity aspect of Svabhava, realities appear in various ways, as  having forms, signs, and shapes; when, Mahamati, these objects, forms,  and signs are adhered to [as real], this adherence takes place in two  ways. The Tathagatas, Arhats, and Fully-Enlightened Ones thus declare  false discrimination to consist in attachment to names and attachment to  objects. By the attachment to objects is meant, Mahamati, to get  attached to inner and external things [as realities]. By the attachment  to names is meant to recognise in these inner and external things the  characteristic marks of individuality and generality and to regard them  as definitely belonging to the objects. These two modes of attachment,  Mahamati, constitute false discrimination. The knowledge of the  relativity-aspect (<em>paratantra</em>) rises from the separation of  subject (<em>asraya</em>) and object (<em>alambana</em>). 
 
Now, Mahamati, what is perfect knowledge? It is realised when one  casts aside the discriminating notions of form, name, reality, and  character; it is the inner realisation by noble wisdom. This (<a name="68"><strong>68</strong></a>) perfect knowledge, Mahamati, is the essence of  the Tathagata-garbha. 
 
Then the Blessed One recited this verse: 
 
134. Form, Name, and Discrimination [correspond to] the two forms of  Svabhava, and Right Knowledge and Suchness [correspond to] the Perfect  Knowledge aspect. 
 
This, Mahamati, is called the doctrine that examines into the nature  of the five Dharmas and the two Svabhavas (self-nature), and constitutes  the state of self-realisation attained by noble wisdom, and in this you  and other Bodhisattvas are to discipline yourselves. 
 
<a name="XXIV"> 
 
### XXIV 
 
</a> 
 
Further again, Mahamati, let the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva have a  thorough understanding as to the nature of the twofold egolessness.  Mahamati, what is this twofold egolessness? [It is the egolessness of  persons and the egolessness of things. What is meant by egolessness of  persons? It means that] in the collection of the Skandhas, Dhatus, and  Ayatanas there is no ego-substance, nor anything belonging to it; the  Vijnana is originated by ignorance, deed, and desire, and keeps up its  function by grasping objects by means of the sense-organs, such as the  eye, etc., and by clinging to them as real; while a world of objects and  bodies is manifested owing to the discrimination that takes place in  the world which is of Mind itself, that is, in the Alayavijnana. By  reason of the habit-energy stored up by false imagination since  beginningless time, this world (<em>vishaya</em>) is subject to change and  destruction from moment to moment; it is like a river, a seed, a lamp,  wind, a cloud; [while the Vijnana itself is] like a monkey who is always  restless, like a fly who is ever in search of unclean things and  defiled places, like a fire (<a name="69"><strong>69</strong></a>) which is never  satisfied. Again, it is like a water-drawing wheel or a machine, it [i.  e., the Vijnana] goes on rolling the wheel of transmigration, carrying  varieties of bodies and forms, resuscitating the dead like the demon  Vetala, causing the wooden figures to move about as a magician moves  them. Mahamati, a thorough understanding concerning these phenomena is  called comprehending the egolessness of persons. 
 
Now, Mahamati, what is meant by the egolessness of things? It is to  realise that the Skandhas, Dhatus, and Ayatanas are characterised with  the nature of false discrimination. Mahamati, since the Skandhas,  Dhatus, and Ayatanas are destitute of an ego-substance, being no more  than an aggregation of the Skandhas, and subject to the conditions of  mutual origination which are causally bound up with the string of desire  and deed; and since thus there is no creating agent in them, Mahamati,  the Skandhas are even destitute of the marks of individuality and  generality; and the ignorant, owing to their erroneous discrimination,  imagine here the multiplicity of phenomena; the wise, however, do not.  Recognising, Mahamati, that all things are devoid of the Citta, Manas,  Manovijnana, the five Dharmas, and the [three] Svabhavas, the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva will well understand what is meant by the  egolessness of things. 
 
Again, Mahamati, when the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva has a good  understanding as regards the egolessness of things, before long he will  attain the first stage [of Bodhisattvahood] when he gets a definite  cognition of the imageless. When a definite acquisition is obtained  regarding the aspect of the stages [of Bodhisattvahood], the Bodhisattva  will experience joy, and, gradually and successively going up the  scale, will reach the ninth stage where his insight is perfected, and  [finally the tenth stage known as] Great Dharmamegha. Establishing  himself here, (<a name="70"><strong>70</strong></a>) he will be seated in the  great jewel palace known as "Great Lotus Throne" which is in the shape  of a lotus and is adorned with various sorts of jewels and pearls; he  will then acquire and complete a world of Maya-nature; surrounded by  Bodhisattvas of the same character and anointed like the son of the  Cakravarti by the hands of the Buddhas coming from all the Buddha-lands,  he will go beyond the last stage of Bodhisattvahood, attain the noble  truth of self-realisation, and become a Tathagata endowed with the  perfect freedom of the Dharmakaya, because of his insight into the  egolessness of things. This, Mahamati, is what is meant by the  egolessness of all things, and in this you and other  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas should well exercise yourselves.

At that time, Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said this to the  Blessed One: Pray teach me about making an assertion and refuting it so  that I and other Bodhisattvas, getting rid of the erroneous views that  may rise from assertion and refutation, may at once realise supreme  enlightenment. Having been enlightened they would keep themselves away  from the eternalistic assertions as well as from the nihilistic  refutations, and leave your enlightenment eye unrefuted. 
 
Then the Blessed One again, understanding the request of Mahamati the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva, recited this verse: 
 
135. Assertions and refutations are not to be found in the Mind-only;  the ignorant who understand not that the Mind is [seen in] the form of  body, property, and abode, wander about with assertions and refutations. 
 
(<a name="71"><strong>71</strong></a>) At that moment the Blessed One said this  to elucidate the meaning of this verse: Mahamati, there are four forms  of assertion made concerning things not in existence. What are the four?  (1) The assertion about individual marks that are non-existent; (2) the  assertion about philosophical views which are non-existent [i. e., not  true]; (3) the assertion about a cause which is non-existent; and (4)  the assertion about objects that are non-existent. These, Mahamati, are  the four assertions. 
 
Again, Mahamati, what is meant by the refutation? It means not  examining properly, because of ignorance, any assertions based on  errors. This, Mahamati, is what characterises assertion and refutation. 
 
Further, Mahamati, what are the characteristics of the assertion made  about individual marks that have no existence? It concerns the marks of  individuality and generality in the Skandhas, Dhatus and Ayatanas,  which do not really exist; but taking them for realities and getting  attached to them, a man may affirm that they are just so and not  otherwise. This, Mahamati, characterises the assertion of individual  marks which are non-existent._1_ This assertion and  discrimination, Mahamati, concerning individual marks that are not  existent, rises from one's attachment to the habit-energy which is  amassed, since beginningless time, by varieties of erroneous views  issuing from false imagination. This, Mahamati, characterises the  assertion of individual marks which are non-existent. 
 
Again, Mahamati, by the assertion of philosophical views which are  non-existent [i. e., not true], is meant that in the Skandhas, Dhatus,  and Ayatanas, [some philosophers] assume the existence of an ego, a  being, a soul, a living being, a nourisher, or a spirit. This is said,  Mahamati, to be the assertion of some philosophical views which are  nonexistent [i. e., not true]. 
 
_1_ This is repeated below and is evidently a clerical  error. 
 
Again, Mahamati, by the assertion of a cause that is nonexistent is  meant that [some philosophers] assume the causeless birth of a first (<a name="72"><strong>72</strong></a>) Vijnana, which later comes to have a Maya-like  non-existence; that is to say, the originally unborn Vijnana begins to  function under the conditions of eye, form, light, and memory. The  functioning goes on for a while and then ceases. This, Mahamati, is the  assertion of a cause that is non-existent. 
 
Again, Mahamati, the assertion about objects that are not-existent is  an assertion arising from the attachment to such non-working existences  as space, cessation, and Nirvana. These, Mahamati, are neither existent  nor nonexistent; for all things are devoid of the alternatives of being  and non-being and are to be known, Mahamati, as the horns of a hare, a  horse, or a camel, or like a hair-net. They are discriminated as  realities by the ignorant who are addicted to assertions and refutations  as their intelligence has not penetrated into the truth that there is  nothing but what is seen of the Mind itself. It is otherwise with the  wise. This, Mahamati, is the characteristic point of the assertion about  objects which are non-existent. For this reason, Mahamati, one should  avoid the views based on assertion and refutation.

Further, Mahamati, the Bodhisattvas who are thoroughly acquainted  with the nature of the Citta, Manas, and Manovijnana, of the five  Dharmas, of the [three] Svabhavas, and of the twofold Egolessness, will  assume various personalities for the sake of benefitting others, just  like the imagination that evolves from the seat of the relativity  knowledge, and again, like the mysterious gem that reflects varieties of  colours. Going over to all the Buddha-lands and assemblages, the  Bodhisattvas will listen to the Buddhas, discourse on the nature of all  things which are like a vision, a dream, an illusion, a reflection, and  the lunar vision in water, and which have nothing to do with  birth-and-death, eternality, and extinction; the Bodhisattvas, thus  facing the Tathagatas, will listen to their discourses on the truth that  does not belong to the Sravaka- and Pratyekabuddha-vehicle. They will  then attain a hundred thousand Samadhis, (<a name="73"><strong>73</strong></a>)  indeed, a hundred thousand niyutas of kotis of Samadhis, and by means of  these Samadhis they will go around from one country to another; they  will do homage to the Buddhas, be born in all the celestial mansions,  where they will discourse on the Triple Treasure, manifesting  Buddha-bodies; and, surrounded by Sravakas and Bodhisattvas, they will,  in order to free them from the alternatives of being and non-being,  instruct them to understand thoroughly what is meant by an objective  world which is nothing but Mind itself and in which there are no  realities. 
 
At that time the Blessed One recited this verse: 
 
136. When those who are born of the Buddha see that the world is no  more than Mind itself, they will obtain a body of transformation, which  has nothing to do with effect-producing works, but which is endowed with  the powers, psychic faculties, and self-control.

At that time again Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva made a request  of the Blessed One. Tell me, Blessed One, how all things are empty,  unborn, non-dual, and have no self-nature, so that I and other  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas might be awakened in the teaching of emptiness,  no-birth, non-duality, and the absence of self-nature, and, quitting the  discrimination of being and non-being, quickly realise the highest  enlightenment. 
 
Then the Blessed One said this to Mahamati the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva: Now, Mahamati, listen well and reflect well upon  what I tell you. 
 
Replied Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva, I will indeed, Blessed  One. (<a name="74"><strong>74</strong></a>) The Blessed One said: Emptiness,  emptiness, indeed! Mahamati, it is a term whose self-nature is false  imagination. Because of one's attachment to false imagination, Mahamati,  we have to talk of emptiness, no-birth, non-duality, and absence of  self-nature. In short, then, Mahamati, there are seven kinds of  emptiness: (1) The emptiness of individual marks (<em>lakshana</em>), (2)  the emptiness of self-nature (<em>bhavasvabhava</em>), (3) the emptiness  of no-work (<em>apracarita</em>), (4) the emptiness of work (<em>pracarita</em>),  (5) the emptiness of all things in the sense that they are unpredicable  (<em>nirabhilapya</em>), (6) the emptiness in its highest sense of  ultimate reality realisable only by noble wisdom, and (7) the emptiness  of mutuality (<em>itaretara</em>) which is the seventh. 
 
Mahamati, what then is the emptiness of individual marks? It is that  all things have no [such distinguishing] marks of individuality and  generality. In consideration of mutuality and accumulation, [things are  thought to be realities], but when they are further investigated and  analysed, Mahamati, they are non-existent, and not predicable with  individuality and generality; and because thus no such ideas as self,  other, or both, hold good, Mahamati, the individual marks no longer  obtain. So it is said that all things are empty as to their self-marks. 
 
Again, Mahamati, what is meant by the emptiness of self-nature?  Mahamati, it is that all things in their self-nature are unborn, hence  the emptiness of self-nature, and it is therefore said that things are  empty in their self-nature. 
 
Again, Mahamati, what is meant by the emptiness of no-work? It is  that the Skandhas are Nirvana itself and there is no work doing in them  from the beginning. Therefore, one speaks of the emptiness of no-work. 
 
(<a name="75"><strong>75</strong></a>) Again, Mahamati, what is meant by the  emptiness of work? It is that the Skandhas are devoid of an ego and its  belongings, and go on functioning when there is a mutual conjunction of  cause and action. Thus one speaks of the emptiness of work. 
 
Again, Mahamati, what is meant by the emptiness of all things in the  sense that they are unpredicable? It is that the nature of the false  imagination is not expressible, hence the emptiness of all things in the  sense of their unpredicability. Thus one speaks of the emptiness of  unpredicability. 
 
Again, Mahamati, what is meant by the emptiness in its highest sense  of ultimate reality realisable by noble wisdom? It is that in the  attainment of an inner realisation by means of noble wisdom there is no  trace of habit-energy generated by all the erroneous conceptions [of  beginningless past]. Thus one speaks of the highest emptiness of  ultimate reality realisable by noble wisdom. 
 
Again, Mahamati, what is meant by the emptiness of mutual  [non-existence]? It is this: when a thing is missing here, one speaks of  its being empty there. For instance, Mahamati, in the lecture-hall of  the Mrigarama there are no elephants, no bulls, no sheep, but as to the  Bhikshus I can say that the hall is not devoid of them; it is empty only  as far as they [i. e. the animals] are concerned. Further, Mahamati, it  is not that the lecture-hall is devoid of its own characteristics, nor  that the Bhikshu is devoid of this Bhikshuhood, nor that in some other  places, too, elephants, bulls, and sheep are not to be found. Mahamati,  here one sees all things in their aspect of individuality and  generality, but from the point of view of mutuality (<em>itaretara</em>)  some things do not exist somewhere. Thus one speaks of the emptiness of  mutual [non-existence]. 
 
These, Mahamati, are the seven kinds of emptiness of which mutuality  ranks the lowest of all and is to be put away by you. 
 
(<a name="76"><strong>76</strong></a>) Again, Mahamati, not that things are not  born, but that they are not born of themselves, except when seen in the  state of Samadhi—this is what is meant by "all things are unborn." To  have no self-nature is, according to the deeper sense, to be unborn,  Mahamati. That all things are devoid of self-nature means that there is a  constant and uninterrupted becoming, a momentary change from one state  of existence to another; seeing this, Mahamati, all things are destitute  of self-nature. So one speaks of all things having no self-nature. 
 
Again, Mahamati, what is meant by non-duality? It means that light  and shade, long and short, black and white, are relative terms,  Mahamati, and not independent of each other; as Nirvana and Samsara are,  all things are not-two. There is no Nirvana except where is Samsara;  there is no Samsara except where is Nirvana; for the condition of  existence is not of mutually-exclusive character._1_ Therefore,  it is said that all things are non-dual as are Nirvana and Samsara. For  this reason, Mahamati, you should discipline yourself in [the  realisation of] emptiness, no-birth, non-duality, and no-self-nature. 
 
<div>_1_ Read after T'ang.</div> 
 
Then at that time the Blessed One recited this couplet of verses: 
 
137. I always preach emptiness which is beyond eternalism and  nihilism; Samsara is like a dream and a vision, and karma vanishes not. 
 
138. Space, Nirvana, and the two forms of cessation— thus (<a name="77"><strong>77</strong></a>) the ignorant discriminate the things which are  not effect-producing, but the wise stand above being and non-being. 
 
At that time again, the Blessed One said this to Mahamati the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva; This [teaching of] emptiness, no-birth,  non-duality, and no-self-nature is found in all the sutras of all the  Buddhas, and this doctrine is recognised in every one of them. However.  Mahamati, the sutras are the teaching in conformity with the  dispositions of all beings and deviate from the [real] sense, and not  the truth-preserving statement. Mahamati, it is like unto the mirage  which entices the deer with its treacherous springs, the springs are not  there but the deer are attached, imagining them to be real. So with the  teachings disclosed in all the sutras, they are for all beings for the  gratification of their own discriminating minds. They are not the  truth-preserving statements meant for noble wisdom to grasp. For this  reason, Mahamati, be in conformity with the sense and be not engrossed  in the word-teaching.

</a> 
 
At that time, Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said this to the  Blessed One: Now the Blessed One makes mention of the Tathagata-garbha  in the sutras, and verily it is described by you as by nature bright and  pure, as primarily unspotted, endowed with the thirty-two marks of  excellence, hidden in the body of every being like a gem of great value,  which is enwrapped in a dirty garment, enveloped in the garment of the  Skandhas, Dhatus, and Ayatanas, and soiled with the dirt of greed,  anger, folly, and false imagination, (<a name="78"><strong>78</strong></a>) while  it is described by the Blessed One to be eternal, permanent, auspicious,  and unchangeable. Is not this Tathagata-garbha taught by the Blessed  One the same as the ego-substance taught by the philosophers? The ego as  taught in the systems of the philosophers is an eternal creator,  unqualified, omnipresent, and imperishable. 
 
The Blessed One replied: No, Mahamati, my Tathagata-garbha is not the  same as the ego taught by the philosophers; for what the Tathagatas  teach is the Tathagata-garbha in the sense, Mahamati, that it is  emptiness, reality-limit, Nirvana, being unborn, unqualified, and devoid  of will-effort; the reason why the Tathagatas who are Arhats and  Fully-Enlightened Ones, teach the doctrine pointing to the  Tathagata-garbha is to make the ignorant cast aside their fear when they  listen to the teaching of egolessness and to have them realise the  state of non-discrimination and imagelessness. I also wish, Mahamati,  that the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas of the present and future would not  attach themselves to the idea of an ego [imagining it to be a soul].  Mahamati, it is like a potter who manufactures various vessels out of a  mass of clay of one sort by his own manual skill and labour combined  with a rod, water, and thread, Mahamati, that the Tathagatas preach the  egolessness of things which removes all the traces of discrimination by  various skilful means issuing from their transcendental wisdom, that is,  sometimes by the doctrine of the Tathagata-garbha, sometimes by that of  egolessness, and, like a potter, by means of various terms,  expressions, and synonyms. For this reason, Mahamati, the philosophers'  doctrine of an ego-substance is not the same (<a name="79"><strong>79</strong></a>)  as the teaching of the Tathagata-garbha. Thus, Mahamati, the doctrine  of the Tathagata-garbha is disclosed in order to awaken the philosophers  from their clinging to the idea of the ego, so that those minds that  have fallen into the views imagining the non-existent ego as real, and  also into the notion that the triple emancipation is final, may rapidly  be awakened to the state of supreme enlightenment. Accordingly,  Mahamati, the Tathagatas who are Arhats and Fully-Enlightened Ones  disclose the doctrine of the Tathagata-garbha which is thus not to be  known as identical with the philosopher's notion of an ego-substance.  Therefore. Mahamati, in order to abandon the misconception cherished by  the philosophers, you must strive after the teaching of egolessness and  the Tathagata-garbha.

</a> 
 
At that moment then the Blessed One recited this verse: 
 
139. The personal soul, continuity, the Skandhas, causation, atoms,  the supreme spirit, the ruler, the creator, —[they are] discriminations  in the Mind-only._1_ 
 
<a name="XXX">

</a> 
 
At that time Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva in consideration of  future generations made this request again of the Blessed One: Pray tell  me, Blessed One, about the perfecting of the discipline whereby the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas become great Yogins. 
 
The Blessed One replied: There are four things, Mahamati, by  fulfilling which the Bodhisattvas become great Yogins. What are the  four? They are: (1) To have a clear understanding as to what is seen of  Mind itself,_2_ (2) to discard the notions of birth, (<a name="80"><strong>80</strong></a>) abiding, and disappearance, (3) to look into  [the truth] that no external world obtains, and (4) to seek for the  attainment of inner realisation by noble wisdom. Provided with these  four things the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas become great Yogins. 
 
_1_ This verse has strangely found its way here. 
 
_2_ This is rather a clumsy translation of <em>svacitta-drisya.  Drisya</em> is "what is seen," that is, this visible world, or this  external, objective world, which according to the <em>Lankavatara</em> is a  manifestation of Mind itself. When this truth is realised, the  objective world loses its reality as such, and we no more cling to it as  if it were a final irreducible fact which stands oppressively against  the mind. The Buddhist idea of interpreting existence idealistically is  more religious than logical, for Buddhists want to elevate the value of  spirit absolutely above matter so that the latter will be amenable to  all the commands to be given by the former. 
 
How, Mahamati, does the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva come to have a clear  understanding as to what is seen of Mind itself? He comes to it by  recognising that this triple world is nothing but Mind itself, devoid of  an ego and its belongings, with no strivings, no comings-and-goings;  that this triple world is manifested and imagined as real, under the  influence of the habit-energy accumulated since beginningless time by  false reasoning and imagination, and with the multiplicity of objects  and actions in close relationship, and in conformity with the ideas of  discrimination, such as body, property, and abode. Thus, Mahamati, the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva acquires a thoroughly clear understanding as to  what is seen of Mind itself. 
 
How again, Mahamati, does the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva discard notions  of birth, abiding, and disappearance? By this it is meant that all  things are to be regarded as forms born of a vision or a dream and have  never been created since there are no such things as self, the other, or  bothness. [The Bodhisattvas] will see that the external world exists  only in conformity with Mind-only; and seeing that there is no stirring  of the Vijnanas and that the triple world is a complicated network of  causation and owes its rise to discrimination, (<a name="81"><strong>81</strong></a>)  they find that all things, inner and external, are beyond  predicability, that there is nothing to be seen as self-nature, and that  [the world] is not to be viewed as born; and thereby they will conform  themselves to the insight that things are of the nature of a vision,  etc., and attain to the recognition that things are unborn. Establishing  themselves on the eighth stage of Bodhisattvahood, they will experience  a revulsion [in their consciousness] by transcending the Citta, Manas,  and Manovijnana, and the five Dharmas, and the [three] Svabhavas, and  the twofold Egolessness, and thereby attain the mind-made body (<em>Manomayakaya</em>).  Thus, Mahamati, the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva will discard the notion of  birth, abiding, and disappearance._1_ 
 
_1_ The proper place of this last sentence is here as  restored; it is found in the Sanskrit text near the end of page 81. 
 
Said Mahamati,_1_ what is meant by the will-body, Blessed  One? The Blessed One replied: It means that one [in this body] can  speedily move unobstructed as he wills; hence the will-body, Mahamati.  For instance, Mahamati, the will [or mind] travels unobstructed over  mountains, walls, rivers, trees, etc., many a hundred thousand yojanas  they may be away, when a man recollects the scenes which had previously  come into his perception, while his own mind keeps on functioning in his  body without the least interruption or hindrance. In the same fashion,  Mahamati, the will-body, in the attainment of the Samadhi called  Maya-like and adorned with such marks as the powers, the psychic  faculties, and the self-control, will be born in the noble paths and  assemblies, moving about as freely as he wishes, as he recalls his  original vows and worlds in order to bring all beings to maturity. 
 
_1_This whole paragraph is a digression, a sort of  explanatory note. The will-body (<em>manomayakaya</em>) is again referred  to later on, p. 115 et seq. 
 
Then, Mahamati, what is meant by the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva (<a name="82"><strong>82</strong></a>) having a good insight into the non-existence of  external objects? It means, Mahamati, that all things are like unto a  mirage, a dream, a hair-net; and seeing that all things are here  essentially because of our attachment to the habit-energy of  discrimination which has been maturing since beginningless time on  account of false imagination and erroneous speculation, the Bodhisattvas  will seek after the attainment of self-realisation by their noble  wisdom. Mahamati, furnished with these four things,  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas become great Yogins. Therefore, in these,  Mahamati, you should exercise yourself. 
 
<a name="XXXI">

</a> 
 
At that time Mahamati again made a request of the Blessed One: Pray  tell me, Blessed One, about the causation of all things, whereby I and  other Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas can see into the nature of causation, and  by getting rid of the discrimination [which issues in the philosophical  views of] eternalism and nihilism, we may no more discriminate as to the  gradual or simultaneous rising of all things. 
 
Replied the Blessed One: Mahamati, there are two factors of causation  by which all things come into existence: external and inner. Mahamati,  the external factors are a lump of clay, a stick, a wheel, thread,  water, a worker, and his labour, the combination of all of which  produces a jar. As with the jar, Mahamati, which is made of a lump of  clay, or a piece of cloth made of thread, or a matting made of fragrant  grass, or the sprout growing out of a seed, or fresh butter which is  produced from sour milk by a man churning it with his own labour, (<a name="83"><strong>83</strong></a>) so it is, Mahamati, with all things which,  governed by external causes, appear one after another in continuous  succession. As regards the inner factors of causation, Mahamati, they  are of such kind as ignorance, desire, and action, which make up our  idea of causation. Born of these, Mahamati, there is the manifestation  of the Skandhas, Dhatus, and Ayatanas. They are not separable  [realities]_1_ but discriminated [as such] by the ignorant. 
 
Now, Mahamati, there are six causes: (1) possibility-cause, (2)  dependence-cause, (3) objectivity-cause, (4) agency-cause, (5)  manifesting-cause, and (6) indifference-cause._2_ The  possibility-cause means, Mahamati, that when a cause to be becomes  effective there is the rising of things inner and outer. The  dependence-cause means, Mahamati, that when conditions to be, become  effective there is the rising of the Skandha-seeds, etc., inner and  outer. Further, the objectivity-cause means, Mahamati, that bound by the  objective world [the Vijnana] keeps up its continuous activity. Again,  Mahamati, the agency-cause means that like a sovereign king a cause  invested with supreme authority asserts itself. Again, the  manifesting-cause means that when the discriminating faculty rises, as  the result it reveals individual marks as a lamp does forms, etc.  Lastly, the indifference-cause means that when there is a dissolution (<a name="84"><strong>84</strong></a>) the power of combination discontinues, and  there rises a state of non-discrimination. 
 
_1_ Wei reads this without the negative particle, while  T'ang omits the whole sentence together with the foregoing, <em>pratityasamutpadasamjnanam  pratilabhante.</em> This latter is also omitted in this translation as  the translator regards its insertion here as a clerical error, which  perhaps was also the idea of the T'ang. 
 
_2_ The Chinese 觀待 (T'ang), 相待 (Wei), or simply 待 (Sung)  points to <em>apeksha</em> rather than to <em>upeksha</em>. In this ease,  "mutual reference" is better. 
 
These, Mahamati, are the outcome of discrimination carried on by the  ignorant and simple-minded, and there is no gradual nor simultaneous  rising of existence. Why? Because, Mahamati, if there is a simultaneous  rising of existence, there would be no distinction between cause and  effect, and there would be nothing to characterise a cause as such. If a  gradual rising is admitted, there is no substance that holds together  individual signs, which makes gradual rising impossible. While a child  is not yet born, Mahamati, the term father has no significance._1_ The logician argues that there is that which is born and that which  gives birth by the mutual functioning of such causal factors as cause,  subsistence, continuity, acceleration, and others; and they conclude  that there is a gradual rising of existence. But, Mahamati, this gradual  rising does not obtain except by reason of their attachment to the  notion of self-nature. When the [ideas of] body, property, and abode are  cherished in what is nothing but the manifestation of Mind itself, the  external world is perceived under the aspects of individuality and  generality, which, however, are not realities; and therefore, Mahamati,  neither a gradual nor a simultaneous rising of things is possible. It is  only when the Vijnana evolves by reason of discrimination which  discriminates the manifestation of Mind itself [that existence is said  to come into view]. For this reason, Mahamati, you must strive to get  rid of notions of gradation and simultaneity in the combination of the  causal activities. Thus it is said: 
 
140. Nothing whatever is born or ceases to exist by reason of  causation; when causation is discriminated there is birth and cessation. 
 
(<a name="85"><strong>85</strong></a>) 141. It is not to keep off the idea of  birth and disappearance which takes place in causation; it is to keep  off the wrong imagination as to causation, which is cherished by the  ignorant. 
 
142. The being and non-being of things subject to causation has no  reality; the triple world owes its existence to the Mind put into  confusion by reason of habit-energy. 
 
143. Not ever being in existence, what things are there that are  born? [but] in causation nothing is lost; when effect-producing objects (<em>samskrita</em>)  are regarded as like unto a barren woman's child or a flower in the  sky, one perceives that grasping (subject) and grasped (object) are an  error and desists [from committing the same error]. 
 
144. There is nothing that is to be born, nor is there anything that  has been born; even causation is not; it is because of wordly usage that  things are talked of as existing. 
 
_1_ In this and what follows the translator has adopted the  reading of T'ang.

### XXXII 
 
</a> 
 
At that moment again Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said this to  the Blessed One: Pray tell me, Blessed One, about the teaching known as  the essence of discrimination as regards words, whereby, Blessed One, I  and other Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas, comprehending and becoming well  acquainted with the essence of discrimination as regards words, will be  thoroughly informed of the signification of two things, expression and  expressed, and, thereby immediately attaining supreme enlightenment,  will explain the signification of these two things, expression and  expressed, for the purification of all beings. 
 
Replied the Blessed One: Then, Mahamati, listen well and reflect  well, (<a name="86"><strong>86</strong></a>) for I will tell you about it. 
 
Well done! said Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva and listened to  the Blessed One. 
 
The Blessed One said this to him: There are, Mahamati, four kinds of  word-discrimination. They are: (1) Words denoting individual marks, (2)  dream-words, (3) words growing out of the attachment to erroneous  speculations and discriminations, and (4) words growing out of the  discrimination that knows no beginning. 
 
Now, Mahamati, the words denoting individual marks rise from  discriminating forms and characteristic signs as real in themselves and  becoming attached to them. The dream-words, Mahamati, rise from the  unreal surroundings which reveal themselves [before the mind] when it  recollects its previous experience. The words growing out of the  attachment to erroneous speculations and discriminations, Mahamati, rise  from recollecting deeds once previously committed. The words growing  out of the discrimination that has been functioning since beginningless  time, Mahamati, rise from the habit-energy whose seeds have been growing  out of the clinging to erroneous speculations and false imaginations  since beginningless time. I say, Mahamati, these are the four features  of word-discrimination, which is the answer to your question. 
 
<a name="XXXIII"> 
 
### XXXIII 
 
</a> 
 
At that time again, Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva requested of  the Blessed One to speak on this subject: Pray tell me again, Blessed  One, about the conditions whereby the word-discrimination manifests  itself. Where, whence, how, and by whom do words indicating  discrimination take place among the people? 
 
Said the Blessed One: Mahamati, the word-discrimination goes on  taking place by the coordination of the head, chest, nose, throat,  palate, lips, tongue, and teeth. 
 
Said Mahamati; Again, Blessed One, (<a name="87"><strong>87</strong></a>) are  words to be considered different (<em>anya</em>) or not-different (<em>ananya</em>)  from discrimination? 
 
Replied the Blessed One: Mahamati, they are neither different nor  not-different. Why? Because words rise, Mahamati, with discrimination as  their cause. If, Mahamati, words are different from discrimination,  they cannot have it for cause. Then if they are not different, words  cannot express the sense, which they do. Therefore, words and  discrimination are neither different nor not-different. 
 
Then Mahamati said: Again, Blessed One, are words themselves the  highest reality? or is what is expressed in words the highest reality? 
 
The Blessed One replied: Mahamati, words are not the highest reality,  nor is what is expressed in words the highest reality. Why? Because the  highest reality is an exalted state of bliss, and as it cannot be  entered into by mere statements regarding it, words are not the highest  reality. Mahamati, the highest reality is to be attained by the inner  realisation of noble wisdom; it is not a state of word-discrimination;  therefore, discrimination does not express the highest reality. And  then, Mahamati, words are subject to birth and destruction; they are  unsteady, mutually conditioning, and are produced by the law of  causation. And again, Mahamati, what is mutually conditioning and  produced by the law of causation cannot express the highest reality,  because the indications [pointing to the distinction between] self and  not-self are non-existent. Mahamati, words are these indications and do  not express [the highest reality]. 
 
(<a name="88"><strong>88</strong></a>) Further, Mahamati, word-discrimination  cannot express the highest reality, for external objects with their  multitudinous individual marks are non-existent, and only appear before  us as something revealed out of Mind itself. Therefore, Mahamati, you  must try to keep yourself away from the various forms of  word-discrimination. 
 
<a name="XXXIV"> 
 
### XXXIV 
 
</a> 
 
Thus it is said: 
 
145. In all things there is no self-nature, words too are devoid of  reality; as the ignorant understand not what is meant by emptiness, yes,  by emptiness, they wander about. 
 
146. In all things there is no self-nature, they are mere words of  people; that which is discriminated has no reality; [even] Nirvana is  like a dream; nothing is seen to be in transmigration, nor does anything  ever enter into Nirvana. 
 
147. As a king or a wealthy householder, giving his children various  clay-made animals, pleases them and makes them play [with the toys], but  later gives them real ones; 148. So, I, making use of various forms and  images of things, instruct my sons; but the limit of reality <em>(bhutakoti)</em> can [only] be realised within oneself. 
 
<a name="XXXV"> 
 
### XXXV 
 
</a> 
 
At that time Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva again (<a name="89"><strong>89</strong></a>)  said this to the Blessed One: Pray tell me, Blessed One, about the  attainment of self-realisation by noble wisdom, which does not belong to  the path and the usage of the philosophers; which is devoid of [all  such predicates as] being and non-being, oneness and otherness, bothness  and not-bothness, existence and non-existence, eternity and  non-eternity; which has nothing to do with the false imagination, nor  with individuality and generality; which manifests itself as the truth  of highest reality; which, going up continuously by degrees the stages  of purification, enters upon the stage of Tathagatahood; which, because  of the original vows unattended by any striving, will perform its works  in infinite worlds like a gem reflecting a variety of colours; and which  is manifested [when one perceives how] signs of individuation rise in  all things as one realises the course and realm of what is seen of Mind  itself, and thereby I and other Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas are enabled to  survey things from the point of view which is not hampered by marks of  individuality and generality nor by anything of the false imagination,  and may quickly attain supreme enlightenment and enable all beings to  achieve the perfection of all their virtues. 
 
Replied the Blessed One: Well done, well done, Mahamati! and again,  well done, indeed, Mahamati! Because of your compassion for the world,  for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, for  the welfare, benefit, happiness of many people, both of celestial beings  and humankind, Mahamati, you present yourself before me and make this  request. Therefore, Mahamati, listen well and truly, and reflect, for I  will tell you. 
 
Assuredly, said Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva, and gave ear to  the Blessed One. 
 
(<a name="90"><strong>90</strong></a>) The Blessed One said this to him:  Mahamati, since the ignorant and the simple-minded, not knowing that the  world is what is seen of Mind itself, cling to the multitudinousness of  external objects, cling to the notions of being and non-being, oneness  and otherness, bothness and not-bothness, existence and non-existence,  eternity and non-eternity, as being characterised by self-nature which  rises from discrimination based on habit-energy, they are addicted to  false imaginings. Mahamati, it is like a mirage in which the springs are  seen as if they were real. They are imagined so by the animals who,  thirsty from the heat of the season, would run after them. Not knowing  that the springs are their own mental hallucinations, the animals do not  realise that there are no such springs. In the same way, Mahamati, the  ignorant and simple-minded with their minds impressed by various  erroneous speculations and discriminations since beginningless time;  with their minds burning with the fire of greed, anger, and folly;  delighted in a world of multitudinous forms; with their thoughts  saturated with the ideas of birth, destruction, and subsistence; not  understanding well what is meant by existent and non-existent, by inner  and outer; the ignorant and simple-minded fall into the way of grasping  at oneness and otherness, being and non-being. Mahamati, it is like the  city of the Gandharvas which the unwitted take for a real city, though  it is not so in fact. This city appears in essence owing to their  attachment to the memory of a city preserved in seed from beginningless  time. This city is thus neither existent nor non-existent. In the same  way, Mahamati, clinging to the memory (<em>vasana</em>) of erroneous  speculations and doctrines since beginningless time, they hold fast to  ideas such as oneness and otherness, being and non-being, and their  thoughts are not at all clear about what is seen of Mind-only. (<a name="91"><strong>91</strong></a>) Mahamati, it is like a man, who, dreaming in  his sleep of a country variously filled with women, men, elephants,  horses, cars, pedestrians, villages, towns, hamlets, cows, buffalos,  mansions, woods, mountains, rivers, and lakes enters into its inner  appartments and is awakened. While awakened thus, he recollects the city  and its inner apartments. What do you think, Mahamati? Is this person  to be regarded as wise, who is recollecting the various unrealities he  has seen in his dream? 
 
Said Mahamati: Indeed, he is not, Blessed One. 
 
The Blessed One continued: In the same way the ignorant and  simple-minded who are bitten by erroneous views and are inclined toward  the philosophers, do not recognise that things seen of the Mind itself  are like a dream, and are held fast by the notions of oneness and  otherness, of being and non-being. Mahamati, it is like the painter's  canvas on which there is no depression nor elevation as imagined by the  ignorant. In the same way, Mahamati, there may be in the future some  people brought up in the habit-energy, mentality, and imagination based  on the philosophers' erroneous views; clinging to the ideas of oneness  and otherness, of bothness and not-bothness, they may bring themselves  and others to ruin; they may declare those people nihilists who hold the  doctrine of no-birth apart from the alternatives of being and  non-being. They [argue against] cause and effect, they are followers of  the wicked views whereby they uproot meritorious causes of unstained  purity. They are to be kept far away by those whose desires are for  things excellent. They are those whose thoughts are entangled in the  errors of self, other, and both, (<a name="92"><strong>92</strong></a>) in the  errors of imagining being and non-being, assertion and refutation, and  hell will be their final refuge. Mahamati, it is like the dim-eyed ones  who, seeing a hair-net, would exclaim to one another, saying: "It is  wonderful! it is wonderful! Look, O honourable sirs!" And the said  hair-net has never been brought into existence. It is in fact neither an  entity nor a non-entity, because it is seen and not seen. In the same  manner, Mahamati, those whose minds are addicted to discrimination of  the erroneous views as cherished by the philosophers, and who are also  given up to the realistic ideas of being and non-being, oneness and  otherness, bothness and not-bothness, will contradict the good Dharma,  ending in the destruction of themselves and others. Mahamati, it is like  a firebrand-wheel which is no real wheel but which is imagined to be of  such character by the ignorant, but not by the wise. In the same  manner, Mahamati, those whose minds have fallen into the erroneous views  of the philosophers will falsely imagine in the rise of all beings  oneness and otherness, bothness and not-bothness. 
 
Mahamati, it is like those water-bubbles in a rainfall which have the  appearance of crystal gems, and the ignorant taking them for real  crystal gems run after them. Mahamati, they are no more than  water-bubbles, they are not gems, nor are they not-gems, because of  their being so comprehended [by one party] and being not so comprehended  [by another]. In the same manner, Mahamati, those whose minds are  impressed by the habit-energy of the philosophical views and  discriminations will regard things born as nonexistent and those  destroyed by causation as existent. 
 
_1_Further, Mahamati, by setting up the three forms of  measure and the [five] members of a syllogism, (<a name="93"><strong>93</strong></a>)  [the philosophers] make the discrimination that there is a reality  existing by itself, which is attained by the realisation of noble  wisdom, and devoid of the two Svabhavas. [This discrimination however  is] not right. [The Buddhist doctrine is this:] Mahamati, when a  [psychological] revulsion takes place in the Yogins [by the  transcendence of] the Citta, Manas, and Vijnana, they cast off the  [dualistic] discrimination of grasped and grasping in what is seen of  Mind itself, and entering the Tathagata-stage attain the realisation of  noble wisdom; and in this there is no thought of existence and  non-existence. Again, Mahamati, if there is the grasping of existence  and non-existence in the realm attained by the Yogins, there will be in  them the grasping of an ego, a nourisher, a supreme soul, or a person.  Again, Mahamati, the teaching pointing to self-nature, individuality and  generality of things, is that of the Transformation Buddha and not that  of the Dharmata Buddha. Again, Mahamati, such teaching is meant for the  ignorant, being in conformity with their mentality, their way of  thinking and viewing things; any establishment that favours the way of  self-nature, fails to reveal the truth of self-realisation to be  attained by noble wisdom and the blissful abode of the Samadhi. 
 
_1_ This whole paragraph must be independently treated. 
 
Mahamati, it is like the trees reflected in water; they are  reflections and yet are not-reflections, the trees are [real] figures,  and yet no-figures. In the same manner, Mahamati, those who are  impressed by the habit-energy of the philosophical views carry on their  discrimination regarding oneness and otherness, bothness and  not-bothness, being and non-being, for their minds are not enlightened  as regards what is seen of Mind-only. 
 
Mahamati, it is like a mirror reflecting all colours and images (<a name="94"><strong>94</strong></a>) as afforded by the conditions and without  discrimination; and they are neither images nor not-images, because they  are seen as images and also as not-images. And, Mahamati, they are  discriminated forms of what is seen of Mind itself, which are known to  the ignorant as images. In the same manner, Mahamati, oneness and  otherness, bothness and not-bothness, are reflected images of Self-Mind  while they appear as if real. 
 
Mahamati, it is like an echo giving the sound of a human voice, of a  river, or of the wind; it is neither existent nor non-existent, because  it is heard as a voice and yet as not a voice. In the same way,  Mahamati, the notions of being and non-being, oneness and otherness,  bothness and not-bothness are the discriminations of Self-Mind and  habit-energy. 
 
Mahamati, it is like a mirage which in conjunction with the sun  appears with its flowing waves on the earth where there are no grass,  shrubs, vines, and trees. They are neither existent nor non-existent,  according to the desire for them or its absence. In the same way,  Mahamati, the discriminating Vijnana of the ignorant which is impressed  with the habit-energy of false imaginations and speculations since  beginningless time, is stirred like a mirage even in the midst of  reality revealed by means of noble wisdom, by the waves of birth,  subsistence, and destruction, of oneness and otherness, bothness and  not-bothness, being and non-being. 
 
Mahamati, it is like Pisaca who by means of his spell makes a corpse  or a wooden image throb with life though it has no power of its own; but  here the ignorant cling to the non-existent imagining them to have the  power of movement. In the same way, Mahamati, (<a name="95"><strong>95</strong></a>)  the ignorant and simple-minded committing themselves to the erroneous  philosophical views are thoroughly devoted to the ideas of oneness and  otherness, but their assertion is not at all well grounded. For this  reason, Mahamati, in order to attain the noble reality attainable within  yourself, you should cast off the discriminations leading to the  notions of birth, abiding, and destruction, of oneness and otherness,  bothness and not-bothness, being and non-being. 
 
Therefore, it is said: 
 
149. The Skandhas, of which the Vijnana is the fifth, resemble the  reflections of the trees in water; they are to be regarded as Maya and a  dream, they are so by thought-construction; make no discriminations! 
 
150. This triple world resembles a hair-net, or water in a mirage  which is agitated; it is like a dream, Maya; and by thus regarding it  one is emancipated. 
 
151. Like a mirage in the spring-time, the mind is found bewildered;  animals imagine water but there is no reality to it. 
 
152. Thus the Vijnana-seed is evolved and the world comes into view;  the ignorant imagine it is born, just like the dim-eyed ones perceive  things in the darkness. 
 
153. Since beginningless time, the ignorant are found transmigrating  through the paths, enwrapped in their attachment to existence; as a  wedge is induced by another wedge, they are led to the abandonment [of  their wrappage]. 
 
154. By regarding the world as always like a magically-moving corpse,  or a machine, or like a dream, or a lightning, or a cloud; (<a name="96"><strong>96</strong></a>) the triple continuation is torn asunder and one  is emancipated. 
 
155. There is here nothing of thought-construction, it is like an  image in the air; when they thus understand all there is nothing to  know. 
 
156. Here is nothing but thought-construction and name. You seek in  vain for individual signs; the Skandhas are like a hair-net wherein  discrimination goes on. 
 
157. A world of multitudes_1_ is a hair-net, a vision, a  dream, and the city of the Gandharvas; it is [a wheel made by] a  firebrand, a mirage; it is a non-entity, only an appearance to people. 
 
158. Eternity and non-eternity; oneness, too, bothness and  not-bothness as well: these are discriminated by the ignorant who are  confused in mind and bound up by errors since beginningless time. 
 
159. In a mirror, in water, in an eye, in a vessel, and on a gem,  images are seen; but in them there are no images [i. e. realities]  anywhere to take hold of. 
 
160. Like a mirage in the air, so is a variety of things mere  appearance; they are seen in diversity of forms, but are like a child in  a barren woman's dream.

Further, Mahamati, the religious teaching of the Tathagatas is free  from the four statements. That is, it is devoid of oneness and  otherness, of bothness and not-bothness, is free from being and  non-being, assertion and refutation; the religious teaching of the  Tathagatas is headed by the [four noble] truths, the [twelvefold] chain  of origination, and [the eightfold noble] path leading to emancipation. (<a name="97"><strong>97</strong></a>) The religious teaching of the Tathagatas,  Mahamati, is not fastened to these ideas: Prakriti, Isvara,  causelessness, spontaneity, atoms, time and self-nature. Again,  Mahamati, [the Tathagatas, leading beings] successively forwards like  the leader of a caravan, in order to purify them from the two hindrances  of passion and knowledge, will establish them in the one hundred and  eight statements of imagelessness and also in the characteristic  distinctions of the vehicles, of the stages [of Bodhisattvahood], and of  the constituents [of enlightenment].

Further, Mahamati, there are four kinds of Dhyanas. What are the  four? They are: (1) The Dhyana practised by the ignorant, (2) the Dhyana  devoted to the examination of meaning, (3) the Dhyana with Tathata  (suchness) for its object, and (4) the Dhyana of the Tathagatas. 
 
What is meant by the Dhyana practised by the ignorant? It is the one  resorted to by the Yogins exercising themselves in the discipline of the  Sravakas and Pratyekabuddhas, who perceiving that there is no  ego-substance, that things are characterised with individuality and  generality, that the body is a shadow and a skeleton which is transient,  full of suffering and is impure, persistently cling to these notions  which are regarded as just so and not otherwise, and who starting from  them successively advance until they reach the cessation where there are  no thoughts. This is called the Dhyana practised by the ignorant. 
 
Mahamati, what then is the Dhyana devoted to the examination of  meaning? It is the one [practised by those who,] having gone beyond the  egolessness of things, individuality and generality, the untenability of  such ideas as self, other, and both, which are held by the  philosophers, proceed to examine and follow up the meaning of the  [various] aspects of the egolessness of things and the stages of  Bodhisattvahood. This is the Dhyana devoted to the examination of  meaning. 
 
What, Mahamati, is the Dhyana with Tathata for its object? When [the  Yogins recognise that] the discrimination of the two forms of  egolessness is mere imagination, and that where he establishes himself  in the reality of suchness (<em>yathabhuta</em>) there is no rising of  discrimination, I call it the Dhyana with Tathata for its object. 
 
(<a name="98"><strong>98</strong></a>) What, Mahamati, is the Dhyana of the  Tathagata? When [the Yogin], entering upon the stage of Tathagatahood  and abiding in the triple bliss which characterises self-realisation  attained by noble wisdom, devotes himself for the sake of all beings to  the [accomplishment of] incomprehensible works, I call it the Dhyana of  the Tathagatas. Therefore, it is said: 
 
161. There are the Dhyana for the examination of meaning, the Dhyana  practised by the ignorant; the Dhyana with Tathata for its object, and  the pure Dhyana of the Tathagata. 
 
162. The Yogin, while in his exercise, sees the form of the sun or  the moon, or something looking like a lotus, or the underworld, or  various forms like sky, fire, etc. 
 
163. All these appearances lead him to the way of the philosophers;  they throw him down into the state of Sravakahood, into the realm of the  Pratyekabuddhas. 
 
164. When all these are tossed aside and there is a state of  imagelessness, then a condition in conformity with Tathata presents  itself; and the Buddhas will come together from all their countries and  with their shining hands will stroke the head of this benefactor.

At that time Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva again said this to  the Blessed One: Thou speakest of Nirvana, Blessed One. What is meant by  this term Nirvana? 
 
Replied the Blessed One: When the self-nature and the habit-energy of  all the Vijnanas, including the Alaya, Manas, and Manovijnana, from  which issues the habit-energy of wrong speculations—when all these go  through a revulsion, I and all the Buddhas declare that there is  Nirvana, and the way and the self-nature of this Nirvana is emptiness,  which is the state of reality. 
 
(<a name="99"><strong>99</strong></a>) Further, Mahamati, Nirvana is the realm  of self-realisation attained by noble wisdom, which is free from the  discrimination of eternality and annihilation, existence and  non-existence. How is it not eternality? Because it has cast off the  discrimination of individuality and generality, it is not eternality.  How about its not being annihilation? It is because all the wise men of  the past, present, and future have attained realisation. Therefore, it  is not annihilation. 
 
Again, Mahamati, the great Parinirvana is neither destruction nor  death. Mahamati, if the great Parinirvana is death, then it will be a  birth and continuation. If it is destruction, then it will assume the  character of an effect-producing deed. For this reason, Mahamati, the  great Parinirvana is neither destruction nor death. Neither has it  anything to do with vanishing;_l_ it is the goal of the Yogins.  Again, Mahamati the great Parinirvana is neither abandonment nor  attainment, neither is it of one meaning nor of no-meaning; this is said  to be Nirvana. 
 
Further, Mahamati, Nirvana conceived by the Sravakas and  Pratyekabuddhas consists in recognising individuality and generality, in  escaping social intercourse, in not having a perverted view of the  world, and not raising discrimination. This is their notion of Nirvana.

Further, Mahamati, there are two kinds of characteristic signs of  self-nature. (<a name="100"><strong>100</strong></a>) What are these two kinds?  They are the attachment to words as having self-nature, and the  attachment to objects as having self-nature. The attachment to words as  having self-nature, Mahamati, takes place owing to one's clinging to the  habit-energy of words and false imaginings since beginningless time.  And the attachment to objects as having self-nature, Mahamati, takes  place from not knowing that the external world is no more than  Self-Mind.

Further, Mahamati, there are two kinds of the sustaining power which  issues from the Tathagatas who are Arhats and Fully-Enlightened Ones;  and sustained by this power [the Bodhisattvas] would prostrate  themselves at their feet and ask them questions. What is this twofold  power that sustains the Bodhisattvas? The one is the power by which they  are sustained to go through the Samadhis and Samapattis; while the  other is the power whereby the Buddhas manifest themselves in person  before the Bodhisattvas and baptise them with their own hands. Then,  Mahamati, sustained by the power of the Buddhas, the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas at their first stage will attain the  Bodhisattva-Samadhi, known as the Light of Mahayana, which belongs to  the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas. They will immediately see the Tathagatas,  Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones appearing before them personally, who  come from all the different abodes in the ten quarters of the world and  who now facing the Bodhisattvas will impart to them their sustaining  power displayed with the body, mouth, and words. Mahamati, as is the  case with Vajragarbha the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva, and with other  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas who are in possession of similar character and (<a name="101"><strong>101</strong></a>) virtue, so, Mahamati, with the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas at the first stage, they will attain the  Tathagatas' power sustaining them in their Samadhis and Samapattis. By  virtue of their stock of merit accumulated for a hundred thousand  kalpas, they will, successively going up the stages and getting  thoroughly acquainted with what they should do and should not do,  finally reach the stage of Bodhisattvahood called Dharmamegha. Here the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva finds himself seated on a throne in the Lotus  Palace, and surrounded by the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas of a similar  class; a tiara decorated and ornamented with all kinds of precious  stones is on his head, and his body_1 _shines brilliantly like  the moon in the yellowish gold colour of the Campaka flower. The Buddhas  now come from their worlds in the ten quarters, and with their  lotus-like hands, sprinkle the forehead of the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva  who is seated on the throne in the Lotus Palace; the Buddhas thus give  him a baptism personally by hand as when a great king invested with  supreme authority [baptises his crown-prince]. This Bodhisattva and  these Bodhisattvas are said to be sustained by the Buddhas' power, being  thus baptised by [their] hands. Mahamati, this is the twofold  sustaining power imparted to the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas, who, sustained  by this twofold sustaining power, personally come into the presence of  all the Buddhas. In no other way are the Tathagatas, Arhats,  Fully-Enlightened Ones to be interviewed. 
 
<div>_1_ According to the Chinese translations.</div> 
 
Further, Mahamati, (<a name="102"><strong>102</strong></a>) whatever Samadhis,  psychic faculties, and teachings are exhibited by the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas, they are sustained by the twofold sustaining  power of all the Buddhas. If, Mahamati, the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas show  their eloquence without the Buddhas' sustaining power, the ignorant and  simple-minded will also show their eloquence. [But the latter do not.]  Why? Because of the sustaining power [on the one hand] and its absence  [on the other]. Where the Tathagatas enter with their sustaining power  there will be music not only in various musical instruments and vessels  but also even in grass, shrubs, trees, and mountains, Mahamati, yes, in  towns indeed, palaces, houses, and royal abodes. How much more those  endowed with sentiency! The mute, blind, and deaf will be cured of their  deficiencies, Mahamati, and will enjoy their emancipation. Such,  Mahamati, is the great extraordinary virtue of the sustaining power  imparted by the Tathagatas. 
 
Further, Mahamati said: Why is it, Blessed One, that when the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas are established in the Samadhis and Samapattis,  and when they are baptised at the most exalted stage, the Tathagatas,  Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones, bestow their sustaining power on them? 
 
Replied the Blessed One: It is in order to make them avoid the evil  ones, karma, and passions, to keep them away from the Dhyana and stage  of the Sravakahood, to have them realise the stage of Tathagatahood, and  to make them grow in the truth and experience already attained. For  this reason, Mahamati, the Tathagatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones  sustain with their power the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas. If they were not  thus sustained, Mahamati, (<a name="103"><strong>103</strong></a>) they would fall  into the way of thinking and feeling as cherished by the wrong  philosophers, Sravakas, or evil ones, and would not attain the highest  enlightenment. For this reason, the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas are upheld  by the Tathagatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones. Thus it is said: 
 
165. The sustaining power is purified by the Buddhas' vows; in the  baptism, Samadhis, etc., from the first to the tenth [stage], [the  Bodhisattvas are in the embrace of the Buddhas]. 
 
<a name="XLI">

At that time again Mahamati the Bodhisattva said thus to the Blessed  One: The chain of origination as told by the Blessed One depends on a  cause producing an effect, and that it is not a theory established on  the principle of a self-originating substance. The philosophers also  proclaim a causal origination when they say that all things rise  conditioned by a supreme spirit, Isvara, a personal soul, time, or atom.  How is it that the rise of all things is explained by the Blessed One  in another terminology bearing on causation but in its meaning not  different? Blessed One, the philosophers explain birth from being and  non-being, while, according to the Blessed One, all things coming into  existence from nothingness pass away by causation,_1_ that is  to say, the Blessed One has Ignorance from which there rises Mental  Conformation until we reach Old Age and Death. This teaching as  explained by the Blessed One is the doctrine of no-causation and not  that of causation. According to the Blessed One,_2_ "that being  so, this is"—if this is simultaneous conditionality and not successive  mutuality, it is not right. There, Blessed One, the philosophers, (<a name="104"><strong>104</strong></a>) teaching excels, and not thine. Why? The  cause assumed by the philosophers is not dependent upon the chain of  origination and produces effects. But, Blessed One, thy cause has  reference to its effect and the effect to its cause, and thus there is  an interconnection of causal links, and from this mutuality follows the  fault of non-finality. When people talk about, "That being so, this is. "  there is a state of causelessness. 
 
_1_ This is according to the Chinese translations; in the  Sanskrit text there is apparently an omission. 
 
_2_ The T'ang reading seems to give the best sense. 
 
Replied the Blessed One: Not so, Mahamati, mine is not a causeless  theory of causation which results in an [endless] interconnection of  causes and conditions. I speak of "That being so, this is" because of my  seeing into the nature of the external world which is nothing but  Self-Mind and because of its unreality of grasped (object) and grasping  (subject). However, Mahamati, when people clinging to the notion of  grasped and grasping fail to understand the world as something seen of  Mind itself; and, Mahamati, by them the fault is committed as they  recognise the external world as real with its beings and non-beings, but  not by my theory of causation.

Further, Mahamati said: Blessed One, is it not because of the reality  of words that all things are? If not for words, Blessed One, there  would be no rising of things. Hence, Blessed One, the existence of all  things is by reason of the reality of words. 
 
Said the Blessed One: Even when there are no [corresponding] objects  there are words, Mahamati; for instance, the hare's horns, the  tortoise's hair, a barren woman's child, etc. (<a name="105"><strong>105</strong></a>)—they  are not at all visible in the world but the words are; Mahamati, they  are neither entities nor nonentities but expressed in words. If,  Mahamati, you say that because of the reality of words the objects are,  this talk lacks in sense. Words are not known in all the Buddha-lands;  words, Mahamati, are an artificial creation. In some Buddha-lands ideas  are indicated by looking steadily, in others by gestures, in still  others by a frown, by the movement of the eyes, by laughing, by yawning,  or by the clearing of the throat, or by recollection, or by trembling.  Mahamati, for instance, in the worlds of the Steady-Looking and in those  of Exquisite Odours, and in the Buddha-land of Samantabhadra the  Tathagata, Arhat, Fully-Enlightened One, the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas by  steadily looking without a wink attain the recognition of all things as  unborn and also various most excellent Samadhis. For this reason,  Mahamati, the validity of all things has nothing to do with the reality  of words. It is observed, Mahamati, even in this world that in the  kingdom of such special beings as ants, bees, etc., they carry on their  work without words. Thus it is said: 
 
166. As space, the hare's horns, and a barren woman's child are  non-entities except as expressed in words, so is this existence  imagined. 
 
167. When causes and conditions are in combination the ignorant  imagine the birth [of this world]; (<a name="106"><strong>106</strong></a>) as  they fail to understand this reason, they wander about in the triple  world which is their dwelling.

At that time Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva again said this to  the Blessed One: Blessed One, where dost thou pronounce sound to be  eternal? 
 
The Blessed One replied: According to error, Mahamati; since even to  the wise there is this error, only that they are free from perversion.  Mahamati, it is like the unwitted in the world who conceive a perverted  idea regarding a mirage, a firebrand wheel, a hair-net, the city of the  Gandharvas, Maya, a dream, a reflected image, and an Aksha-purusha, but  with the knowing it is not so, though it. does not mean that those  illusions do not appear to them. When, Mahamati, there is this error,  diversities of forms are seen, though to this error the idea of  impermanence is inapplicable. Why? Because it cannot be characterised  with the ideas of being and non-being. Again, Mahamati, how are the  ideas of being and non-being inapplicable to this error? Because all the  ignorant take in varieties of situations, like the waves of the ocean  and the waters of the Ganges which are not seen by the Pretas, but seen  [by others]. For this reason, Mahamati, the error-existence [or this  world of illusion] is not, but as this water is manifest to other people  it is not a non-existence either. Thus to the wise, the error is  neither a perversion nor a non-perversion. And for this reason,  Mahamati, the error in itself is characterised with permanency, having  the nature of non-distinction [as far as its own appearance is  concerned]. Mahamati, being discriminated as regards its diversified  individual signs, (<a name="107"><strong>107</strong></a>) the error is perceived  as differentiated. Thus the error, [as far as its own nature is  concerned], is characterised with permanency. Again, Mahamati, how is  the error to be considered reality? Mahamati, for this reason that as  regards this error the wise cherish neither a perverted knowledge nor an  unperverted knowledge. It is [such as it is and] not otherwise. In  case, Mahamati, the wise should cherish any thought whatever in this  error, it goes contrary to the reality attainable by noble wisdom. If  there is anything at all here it is the prattling of the ignorant, it is  not the talk of the wise. 
 
Again, when the error is discriminated according to a perverted and  an unperverted view, it gives rise to two classes of family, one of  which is the family of the wise, and the other the family of the  ignorant and simple-minded. Now, Mahamati, the family of the wise is  divisible into three kinds, that is, the Sravakas, the Pratyekabuddhas,  and the Buddhas. Mahamati, how does the Sravakayana family rise from the  discrimination whereby the ignorant conceive the error? Mahamati, there  is the rise of the �Sravakayana family where the attachment to the  notions of individuality and generality is kept up. This is the way,  Mahamati, this error gives rise to the Sravakayana family. Mahamati, how  does the Pratyekabuddhayana family rise as the error is discriminated?  Mahamati, when in this error the attachment to the notions of  individuality and generality (<a name="108"><strong>108</strong></a>) leads one to  a retirement from social life, there rises the Pratyebuddhayana family.  Mahamati, how is there the rise of the Buddhayana family when this  error is discriminated by the intelligent? Mahamati, when the world is  understood to be nothing but Mind itself, the existence and  non-existence of external objects ceases to be discriminated, and there  is the rise of the Buddhayana family. Mahamati, this is the family, that  is, what is meant by the family. 
 
Again, Mahamati, when the error is discriminated by the ignorant,  there is the manifestation of varieties of objects which calls forth the  assertion [on their part] that this is so and not otherwise; whence  rises the family of the transmigration vehicle. For this reason,  Mahamati, the error is discriminated by the ignorant as characterised by  multitudinousness, and this error is neither a reality nor an  unreality. Thus, Mahamati, this error being discriminated by the wise  turns into Tathata (suchness) with them, by virtue of a revulsion which  takes place in them concerning the Citta, Manas, Manovijnana, false  reasoning, habit-energy, the [three] Svabhavas, and the [five] Dharmas.  Thus, Mahamati, there is this statement that Tathata is Mind  emancipated. Mahamati, the meaning of this statement is here thus  clearly expressed by me, that is, by the discarding of discrimination is  meant the abandonment of all discriminations. So much for this  statement. 
 
Mahamati said, Blessed One, is the error an entity or not? 
 
The Blessed One replied: It is like Maya, Mahamati, the error has no  character in it making for attachment; if, Mahamati, the error had any  character in it making for attachment, (<a name="109"><strong>109</strong></a>) no  liberation would be possible from the attachment to existence, the  chain of origination would be understood in the sense of creation as  held by the philosophers. 
 
Mahamati said: Blessed One, if the error is like Maya, it will  thereby be the cause of another error. 
 
The Blessed One said: No, Mahamati, Maya cannot be the cause of the  error, because of its incapability of producing evils and faults; and  thus, Mahamati, Maya does not give rise to evil thoughts and faults.  Again, Mahamati, Maya has no discrimination of itself; it rises when  invoked by the magical charm of a certain person. It has in itself no  habit-energy of evil thoughts and faults that, issuing from  self-discrimination, affect it. [Therefore,] there are no faults in it.  This is only due to the confused view fondly cherished by the ignorant  regarding Mind, and the wise have nothing to do with it. So it is said: 
 
168. The wise do not see [the(?)] error, nor is there any truth in  its midst; if truth is in its midst, [the(?)] error would be truth. 
 
169. If there is the rising of individual forms (<em>nimitta</em>)  apart from all error, this will indeed be error, the defiled is like  darkness._1_

Further, Mahamati, Maya is not an unreality, because it has the  appearance of reality; and all things have the nature of Maya. 
 
Said Mahamati: Is it, Blessed One, that all things are like Maya  because Maya is something imagined and clung to as having  multitudinousness of individual forms? (<a name="110"><strong>110</strong></a>) Or  is it due to the incorrect imagining of individual forms? If all things  have the likeness of Maya because Maya is something imagined and clung  to as having multitudinousness of individual forms, then see, Blessed  One, things are not like Maya. Why? Because forms are seen in the  multitudinousness of individual signs not without due causes. If they  ever appear without due causes, assuming the multitudinousness of  individual signs and shapes, [then] they would be like Maya. For this  reason, Blessed One, that things are like Maya is not because they [i.  e. all things and Maya] are both alike in being imagined and clung to as  having multitudinousness of individual signs. 
 
Said the Blessed One: It is not, Mahamati, that all things are Maya  because they are both alike in being imagined and clung to as having  multitudinousness of individual signs, but that all things are like Maya  because they are unreal and like a lightning-flash which is seen as  quickly disappearing. Mahamati, a lightning appears and disappears in  quick succession as is manifest to the ignorant; in the same way,  Mahamati, all things assume individuality and generality according to  the discrimination [of the Mind] itself. When the state of imagelessness_2_ is recognised, objects which are imagined and clung to as in possession  of individual signs cease to assert themselves. Thus it is said: 
 
170. Maya is not without reality, because it has something resembling  it; the reality of all things is talked of [in a similar manner]; they  are unreal like a lightning-flash [appearing and disappearing] quickly,  and therefore they are regarded as resembling Maya.

Further, Mahamati said: Now according to the Blessed One, all things  are unborn (<a name="111"><strong>111</strong></a>) and resemble Maya; but,  Blessed One, is there not the fault of contradiction between the  previous statement and the later one? It is asserted by thee that that  all things are unborn is due to their having the nature of Maya._1_ 
 
The Blessed One replied: Mahamati, when all things are asserted  to be unborn because of their having the nature of Maya, there is no  fault of contradiction between my previous statement and my later one.  Why? Because birth is no-birth, when it is recognised that the world  that presents itself before us is no more than Mind itself; and as to  all external objects of which we state that they are or are not, they  are to be seen as non-existent and unborn; and thus, Mahamati, there is  here no fault of contradiction between my previous statement and my  later one. But, Mahamati, in order to cast aside the philosophers'  thesis on birth by causation, it is asserted that all things are like  Maya and unborn. Mahamati, the philosophers who are the gathering of the  deluded, foster the notion of deriving the birth of all things from  that of being and non-being, and fail to regard it as caused by the  attachment to the multidinousness which rises from the discrimination  [of the Mind] itself. Mahamati, no fear rises in me [by making this  statement]._2_ In this light, Mahamati, the term "unborn" is to  be understood. 
 
_1_ This last sentence is missing in T'ang, whereas Wei has:  "It is said by the Tathagata that all things are unlike maya." 
 
_2_ T'ang, says: I say that all things are non-existent  because of their being unborn. Wei: I say that all things are unborn  when existent, unborn when non-existent. Sung: I do not [say] that the  existent and the non-existent are born. 
 
Again, Mahamati, the teaching that all things exist is given in order  to admit transmigration, to check nihilism which says "Nothing is," and  to make my disciples accept the doctrine that asserts the reality of  karma in various forms and birth in the various worlds, for by admitting  the terminology of existence we admit transmigration. Mahamati, the  teaching that all things are characterised with the self-nature of Maya  is meant to make the ignorant and simple-minded cast aside the idea of  self-nature in anything; (<a name="112"><strong>112</strong></a>) as they cherish  the thoughts characterised with error, as they do not clearly grasp the  meaning of the world which is no more than the Mind itself, they imagine  and cling to causation, work, birth, and individual signs; in order to  check this I teach that all things are characterised in their  self-nature with the nature of Maya and a dream. Attached to erroneous  thoughts they contradict both themselves and others by not seeing all  things as they really and truly are. Mahamati, to see all things as they  really and truly are means to realise that there is nothing to be seen  but Mind itself. So it is said: 
 
171. In the theory of no-birth, causation is not accepted [as is  maintained by the ignorant]; where existence is accepted transmigration  prevails; seeing that [all things] are like Maya, etc., one does not  discriminate individual signs.

Further, Mahamati, we will explain the characteristics of name-body,  the sentence-body, and the syllable-body; for when name-body,  sentence-body, and syllable-body are well understood, the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas conformable to the signification of a sentence  and a syllable will quickly realise supreme enlightenment and thereby  awaken all beings to it. Mahamati, by name-body is meant the object  depending on which a name obtains, the body is this object; in another  sense the body means substance (<em>sarira</em>). Mahamati, this is the  body of a name. By the body of a sentence is meant what it signifies,  the real object, determining its sense definitely. In another sense, it  completes its reference. Mahamati, this is my teaching as regards the  sentence-body. By the syllable-body (<a name="113"><strong>113</strong></a>) is  meant that by which names and sentences are indicated; it is a symbol, a  sign; in another sense, it is something indicated. 
 
Again, Mahamati, the sentence (<em>pada</em>) -body means the  completion of the meaning expressed in the sentence. Again, Mahamati, a  name (or a letter, <em>nama)</em> means each separate letter distinguished  as to its self-nature from <em>a</em> to <em>ha.</em> Again, Mahamati, a  syllable (<em>vyanjana</em>) is short, long, or lengthy. Again, Mahamati,  regarding the sentence (<em>pada</em>) -body the idea of it is obtained  from the foot-prints left on the road by elephants, horses, people,  deer, cattle, cows, buffalos, goats, rams, etc. Again, Mahamati, names (<em>nama</em>)  and syllables (<em>vyanjana</em>) belong to the four Skandhas which being  formless are indicated by names; thus are names made. By means of the  differently characterised names there are syllables (<em>vyanjana</em>);  thus are syllables made. This, Mahamati, is the meaning of the body of a  name (<em>nama</em>), a sentence (<em>pada</em>), and a syllable (<em>vyanjana</em>).  You should endeavour to have a thorough understanding of these terms.  It is thus said: 
 
172. Because of the distinction between <em>nama, pada,</em> and <em>vyanjana,</em> the ignorant, the dull-witted, stick to them like the elephant in deep  mud.

(<a name="114"><strong>114</strong></a>) Further, Mahamati, in the time to  come, those wrong-headed ones who are inclined to false speculations  owing to their deficiency of knowledge concerning truth and cause may be  asked by the wise, regarding that which is liberated from the dualistic  conceptions of things such as oneness and otherness, bothness and  not-bothness; and thus asked, they may answer, saying, "It is no  question; it is not at all properly put—that is to say, the question:  Are form, etc. and transiency to be considered one or different?" 
 
In the same way, Nirvana and the Skandhas, indices and indicated,  qualities and qualified, realities and the elements, seen and seeing,  dust and atoms, knowledge and the Yogins—[are these to be considered one  or different?] Such questions concerning the various aspects of  existence lead successively from one thing to another without end, and  those who are asked about these unexplainable questions would declare  that they were put aside by the Blessed One as impossible to answer.  However, these deluded people are unable to realise [the meaning of]  what they heard [from the Buddha] because of their deficiency of  knowledge. The Tathagatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones do not explain  these things to all beings because of their wish to keep the latter  from the fear-inspiring phrases. 
 
Mahamati, these inexplicables (<em>vyahriani</em>) are not taken up for  consideration by the Tathagatas in order to keep the philosophers away  from their wrong views and theories. Mahamati, the philosophers may  declare thus: what life is that is the body, or life is one thing, body  is another. In these they make inexplicable statements. Mahamati,  entirely bewildered by the idea of a creator, the philosophers make an  inexplicable statement, but that is not found in my teaching. In my  teaching, Mahamati, discrimination does not take place because I teach  to stand above grasped and grasping. (<a name="115"><strong>115</strong></a>) How  could there be any setting aside here? But, Mahamati, to those who are  addicted to grasped and grasping, as they do not have a thorough  understanding of the world which is no more than what is seen of the  Mind itself, there is something to be set aside [as inexplicable].  Mahamati, the Tathagatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones teach the  Dharma to all beings by means of the four forms of questioning and  answering. As to the propositions that are set aside [as inexplicable],  Mahamati, they are made use of by me on some other occasions for those  whose senses are not yet fully matured; but for those of matured senses  there is nothing to set aside.

Further, Mahamati, all things being devoid of doing and doer are  unborn; as there is no doer, all things are therefore said to be unborn.  Mahamati, all things are without self-nature. Why? Because, Mahamati,  when they are examined by self-knowledge, there are no such signs  obtainable which characterise them with individuality and generality;  therefore, all things are said to have no self-nature. Again, Mahamati,  in all things there is no taking birth, no going-out. Why? Because,  Mahamati, the signs of individuality and generality are seen as existing  and yet they are non-existent; they are seen as going out, and yet they  do not go out. For this reason, Mahamati, all things are neither taking  birth, nor are they going out. Again, Mahamati, all things are never  annihilated. Why? For this reason that the individual signs that make up  the self-nature of things are nonexistent, and all things are beyond  reach. Therefore, all things are said never to be annihilated. Again,  Mahamati, all things are not eternal. Why? (<a name="116"><strong>116</strong></a>)  Because the rising of individual signs is characterised with  non-eternality. Therefore, all things are said not to be eternal. Again,  Mahamati, all things are eternal. Why? Because the rising of individual  signs is no-rising and is non-existent; and all things are eternal  because of their non-eternality. Therefore, Mahamati, all things are  said to be eternal. Thus it is said: 
 
173. _1_The four kinds of explanation are: direct statement,  questioning, discernment, and setting aside; whereby the philosophers  are kept away. 
 
174. The Sankha and the Vaiseshika philosophers teach birth from a  being or from a non-being; all that are proclaimed by them are the  inexplicables. 
 
175. When the self-nature [of all things] is examined by knowledge,  it is beyond reach; therefore, they are without self-nature and  unattainable.

At that time Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva again said this to  the Blessed One: Pray tell me, Blessed One, regarding the Stream-entered  and their special attainment which characterises the state of the  Stream-entered, whereby I and other Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas thoroughly  becoming acquainted with the Stream-entered and their special attainment  characterising the state of the Stream-entered, will proceed to know  the means and conduct which characterises the state of the  Once-returning, Never-returning, and Arhatship; and they will then  explain the Dharma to all beings in this manner. Having understood the  twofold form of egolessness and (<a name="117"><strong>117</strong></a>) having  cleansed themselves of the twofold hindrance, they will by degrees go  through the stages of Bodhisattvahood each of which has its own  characteristics, and attaining Tathagatahood whose spiritual realm is  beyond conceivability, they will be like a multicoloured gem and will  accomplish what is good for the lives of all beings, providing them with  every teaching, condition, deportment, body, and enjoyment. 
 
Replied the Blessed One: Listen well Mahamati, and take well to  heart; I will tell you. 
 
Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva answering him said: Very well,  Blessed One. 
 
The Blessed One then said this: Mahamati, in the fruit attained by  the Sravakas, three kinds are distinguishable. What are the three? They  are graded, Mahamati, low, middle, and the highest. The low ones will be  reborn seven times when their existence will come to an end; the  middling will attain Nirvana in three or five births; the highest will  attain Nirvana in this birth. Mahamati, for these three classes [of the  Stream-entered] there are three kinds of knots: weak, middling, and  strong. What are these three knots, Mahamati? They are: (1) the view of  an individual personality, (2) doubt, and (3) the holding-on to moral  practices. Mahamati, when all these three knots are in succession  promoted to the higher stage then_1_ will be the attainment of  Arhatship. 
 
Mahamati, there are two kinds of the view of an individual  personality; that is, (1) the inborn one and (2) the one <em>due</em> to  the false imagination; it is like [the relation between] the relativity  view and the false imagination [of the three] Svabhavas. (<a name="118"><strong>118</strong></a>)  For instance, Mahamati, depending on the relativity view of things  there arise varieties of attachments to the false imagination. But this  [existence] is neither a being, nor a non-being, nor a  being-and-non-being; it is not a reality because of the false  imagination, and, being discriminated by the ignorant, assumes varieties  of individual signs to which they are strongly attached just as the  deer does to a mirage. Mahamati, this is the view of an individual  personality falsely imagined by the Stream-entered, which has been  accumulated for a long time by their ignorance and attachment. This is  destroyed when the egolessness of a person is attained by which the  clinging ceases. 
 
Mahamati, the inborn view of an individual personality as held by the  Stream-entered [is destroyed in this way]. When this body which belongs  equally to each of us is considered, it is perceived that it consists  of form and the other four Skandhas, that form takes its rise from the  elements and their belongings, that the elements are mutually  conditioning, and that hence there is no aggregate known as form. When  thus the Stream-entered realise that the idea of being and non-being is a  partial view [of truth], the view of individual personality is  destroyed. When the view of individual personality is thus destroyed,  covetousness will never assert itself. This, Mahamati, is what  characterises the view of individual personality. 
 
Again, Mahamati, as regards the nature of doubt, when the Dharma is  attained, and realised, and thoroughly understood as to its  characteristics, and when the twofold view of individual personality is  destroyed as previously described, no doubt is cherished in the teaching  [of the Buddhas]. And there is no thought [in the minds of the  Stream-entered] to follow the lead of any other teacher because of [the  difference between] purity and non-purity. This,. Mahamati, is what is  meant by doubt [discarded] (<a name="119"><strong>119</strong></a>) by the  Stream-entered. 
 
Again, Mahamati, how is it that the Stream-entered do not hold  themselves to the morality? They do not because they clearly see into  the nature of suffering wherever they may be reborn. [What is meant by]  the holding? Mahamati, that the ignorant and simple-minded observe the  rules of morality, piety, and penance, is because they desire thereby to  attain worldly enjoyments and happinesses; they cherish the hope of  being born in agreeable conditions. And [the Stream-entered] do not hold  [to the rules of morality], for their thoughts are turning only towards  the exalted state of self-realisation, and the reason why they devote  themselves to the details of morality is that they wish to master such  truths as are in conformity with non-discrimination and undefiled  outflows. This, Mahamati, is the way in which the Stream-entered Ones  hold to morality and piety. Mahamati, by thus breaking up the three  knots the Stream-entered will discard covetousness, anger, and folly. 
 
Mahamati said: Many kinds of covetousness are taught by the Blessed  One; which one of them is to be cast aside? 
 
The Blessed One replied: The world where love grows, i. e., the  desire for sexual embrace, showing itself in beating, slapping,  suggesting, kissing, embracing, smelling, looking-sidewise, or gazing  may give one momentary pleasures but is productive of future grief.  [With the Stream-entered] there is no greed for such. Why? Because they  are abiding in the bliss of the Samadhi which they have attained. Hence  this casting aside, but not of the desire for Nirvana. 
 
(<a name="120"><strong>120</strong></a>) Again, Mahamati, what is the fruit of  the Once-returning? There is once in them the discrimination of forms,  signs, and appearances; but as they learn not to view individual objects  under the aspect of qualified and qualifying, and as they know well  what marks the attainment of the Dhyana, they once come back into the  world, and putting an end to suffering, realise Nirvana. Hence the  appellation "Once-returning. " 
 
Again, Mahamati, what is meant by Never-returning? It means that  while there is yet the viewing of individual objects as characterised by  being and non-being in the past, present, and future, the  discrimination does not return with its errors and faults, the dormant  passions do not assert themselves, and the knots are completely cut off  never to return. Hence the appellation "Never-returning." 
 
Again, Mahamati, the Arhat is the one who has attained the Dhyanas,  Samadhis, emancipations, powers, psychic faculties, and with whom there  are no more passions, sufferings, and discriminations. Hence the  appellation "Arhat." 
 
Mahamati said: Now, the Blessed One declares that there are three  kinds of Arhats: to which one of the three is this term "Arhat" to be  applied? To one who makes straightway for the path of cessation? Or to  one who neglects all his accumulated stock of merit for the sake of his  vow to enlighten others? Or to one who is a form of the Transformation  [Buddha]? 
 
Replied the Blessed One: Mahamati, [the term "Arhat"] applies to the  Sravaka who makes straightway for the path of cessation, and to no  others. Mahamati, as for the others, they are those who have finished  practising the deeds of a Bodhisattva; they are forms of the  Transformation Buddha. With skilful means born of their fundamental and  original vows (<a name="121"><strong>121</strong></a>), they manifest themselves  among the multitudes in order to adorn the assemblages of the Buddhas.  Mahamati, here in these paths and abodes of existence they give out  varieties of teachings which are based on discrimination; that is to  say, as they are above such things as the attainment of the fruit, the  Dhyanas, the Dhyana-practisers, or subjects for meditation, and as they  know that this world is no more than what is seen of the Mind itself,  they discourse on the fruit attained [for the sake of all beings].  Further, Mahamati, if the Stream-entered should think."These are the  fetters, but I am disengaged from them, " they commit a double fault:  they still hold to the vices of the ego, and they have not freed  themselves from the fetters. 
 
Further, Mahamati, in order to go beyond the Dhyanas, the  immeasurables, and the formless world, the signs of this visible world  which is Mind itself should be discarded. The Samapatti leading to the  extinction of thought and sensation does not enable one to transcend the  world of particulars, for there is nothing but Mind. So it is said: 
 
176. The Dhyanas, the immeasurables, the formless, the Samadhis, and  the complete extinction of thought (<em>nirodha</em>)—these do not exist  where the Mind alone is. 
 
177. The fruit of the Stream-entered, and that of the Once-returning,  and that of the Never-returning, and Arhatship—these are the bewildered  states of mind. 
 
178. The Dhyana-practiser, the Dhyana, the subject for it, the  destruction, the seeing of the truth, —these are no more than  discriminations; when this is recognised there is emancipation. 
 
<a name="L">

</a> 
 
(<a name="122"><strong>122</strong></a>) Further, Mahamati, there are two kinds  of intellect: the intellect as an examining function, and the intellect  which functions in connection with the attachment to ideas of  discrimination. As for the intellect that examines, Mahamati, it is that  act of intellect which examines into the self-nature of things, finding  it to be devoid of the four propositions, and unattainable. This is  known as the intellect that examines. What is meant by [being devoid of]  the four propositions? It means to be devoid of oneness and otherness,  bothness and not-bothness, being and non-being, eternity and  non-eternity. These are called the four propositions. Mahamati, train  yourself to examine carefully all things as regards these four  propositions. What, Mahamati, is the intellect which functions in  connection with the attachment to ideas of discrimination? It is the  intellect with which the Mind is discriminated and the ideas arising  therefrom are adhered to [as real]; and this adherence gives rise to the  conceptions of warmth, fluidity, motility, and solidity as  characterising the gross elements; while the tenacious holding to  proposition, reason, definition, and illustration, leads to the  assertion of a non-entity [as entity]. This is called the intellect that  functions in connection with the attachment to ideas of discrimination. 
 
This, Mahamati, is what characterises the two kinds of intellect, in  accordance with which the Bodhisattvas, thoroughly mastering the signs  of egolessness of persons and things, (<a name="123"><strong>123</strong></a>)  and, by means of knowledge of imagelessness, becoming conversant with  the stage of examination and practice, will attain the first stage [of  Bodhisattvahood] and acquire one hundred Dhyanas. Attaining the  excellent Samadhis, they will see one hundred Buddhas and Bodhisattvas,  they will enter into one hundred kalpas that were prior to the present  and also into those that will follow the present, they will illuminate  one hundred Buddha-lands, and, illuminating one hundred Buddha-lands,  they will understand the signs belonging to the higher stages; and by  virtue of the most exalted vows they will manifest wonderful powers,  they will be baptised by [the Buddhas] when they reach the stage of  Dharmamegha (law-cloud); and realising the inmost realm of the  Tathagatas, they will be provided with things which are closely  connected with the ten inexhaustible vows; and, in order to bring all  beings into maturity, they will shine out in various forms with the rays  of transformation; they will be quite absorbed in the bliss of  self-realisation. 
 
<a name="LI">

Further, Mahamati, the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas are to be well  acquainted with the primary and the secondary elements. How do the  Bodhisattvas know the primary and the secondary elements? Mahamati, the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas are to know this that the truth is that the  primary elements have never come into existence, and that, Mahamati,  these elements are unborn. Thus understood, there is nothing in the  world but what is discriminated [by our imagination]. When it is  recognised that the visible world is no more than Mind itself, external  objects cease to be realities, and there is nothing but what is  discriminated by the mind and perceived [as external]. That is to say,  let it be understood that the triple world has nothing to do with the  primary and the secondary elements, (<a name="124"><strong>124</strong></a>) that  it is removed from the four propositions and philosophical systems, that  it has nothing to do with a personal ego and what belongs to it; and  that it establishes itself in the abode of real reality, where it is  seen in its own form, i. e. in its unborn state. 
 
Mahamati, what is meant by the elements derived from the primary  elements? The element discriminated as vascidity produces the realm of  water, inner and outer; the element discriminated as energy produces the  realm of fire, inner and outer; the element discriminated as motility  produces the realm of air, inner and outer; the element discriminated as  divisibility of form gives birth to the realm of earth together with  space, inner and outer. Because of the attachment to the incorrect  truths there is the aggregation of the five Skandhas giving rise to the  elements primary and secondary. 
 
Again, Mahamati, the Vijnana has its cause in our attachment to and  the desire for the multitudinousness of statements and objective fields;  and it continues to evolve in another path of existence. Mahamati, the  secondary elements such as earth, etc., [are said] to have their cause  in the primary elements which, however, are non-existent. Because,  Mahamati, of things endowed with being, characteristics, marks,  perceivableness, abode, and work, one can say that they are born of the  combination of various effect-producing [elements]; but not of things  which are devoid of characteristic marks. For this reason, Mahamati, the  elements primary and secondary are the discriminations of the  philosophers and not mine.

Further, Mahamati, I will explain what characterises the self-nature  of the Skandhas. Mahamati, what are the five Skandhas? They are form, (<a name="125"><strong>125</strong></a>) sensation, thought, conformation, and  consciousness. Mahamati, four of these have no material forms—sensation,  thought, conformation, and consciousness. Form, Mahamati, belongs to  what is made of the four primary elements, and these elements differ  from one another in their individual signs. But the four Skandhas that  are without form cannot be reckoned as four, they are like space. For  instance, Mahamati, space cannot be numbered, and it is due to our  discrimination that it is designated as such; in the same way, Mahamati,  the Skandhas that are beyond calculability as they have no  number-marks, are not to be predicated as existing and non-existing, and  are beyond the four propositions; but to the ignorant they are  described as subject to numeration, but not so to the wise. 
 
Again, Mahamati, by the wise the five Skandhas are regarded as  thought-constructions, devoid of [dualisties such as] otherness and  not-otherness; for they are like varieties of forms and objects in a  vision, like images and persons in a dream. As they have no better  substance for their support, and as they obstruct the passage of noble  wisdom, there is what is known as the Skandha-discrimination. This,  Mahamati, is what characterises the self-nature of the Skandhas. This  discrimination must be discarded by you, and having discarded this, you  should declare the truth of solitude. Keeping back the views held by the  philosophers, the truth of solitude is to be announced in all the  Buddha-assemblies, Mahamati, and thereby the teaching of the egolessness  of things is purified and you will enter upon the stage of Far-going (<em>duramgama</em>).  Entering upon the stage of Duramgama you will become the master of many  Samadhis, and, attaining the will-body (<a name="126"><strong>126</strong></a>)  you will realise the Samadhi known as Mayopama (Maya-like). Thoroughly  conversant with the powers, psychic faculties and self-control, you will  be the supporter of all beings like the earth. Mahamati, as the great  earth is the supporter of all beings, so is the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva  the supporter of all beings.

Further, Mahamati, there are four kinds of Nirvana. What are the  four? They are: (1) the Nirvana which is attained when the self-nature  of all things is seen as nonentity; (2) the Nirvana which is attained  when varieties of individual marks characterising all things are seen as  non-entities; (3) the Nirvana which is attained when there is the  recognition of the non-existence of a being endowed with its own  specific attributes; and (4) the Nirvana which is attained when there  takes place the severance of the bondage conditioning the continuation  of individuality and generality of the Skandhas. Mahamati, these four  views of Nirvana belong to the philosophers and are not my teaching.  According to my teaching, Mahamati, the getting rid of the  discriminating Manovijnana—this is said to be Nirvana. 
 
Mahamati said: Does not the Blessed One establish eight Vijnanas? 
 
The Blessed One replied: I do, Mahamati. 
 
Mahamati said: If eight Vijnanas are established, why do you refer to  the getting-rid of the Manovijnana and not of the seven [other]  Vijnanas [as well]? 
 
The Blessed One said: With the Manovijnana as cause and supporter,  Mahamati, there rise the seven Vijnanas. Again, Mahamati, the  Manovijnana is kept functioning, as it discerns a world of objects and  becomes attached to it, and by means of manifold habit-energy [or  memory] (<a name="127"><strong>127</strong></a>) it nourishes the Alayavijnana.  The Manas is evolved along with the notion of an ego and its belongings,  to which it clings and on which it reflects. It has no body of its own,  nor its own marks; the Alayavijnana is its cause and support. Because  the world which is the Mind itself is imagined real and attached to as  such, the whole psychic system evolves mutually conditioning. Like the  waves of the ocean, Mahamati, the world which is the mind-manifested, is  stirred up by the wind of objectivity, it evolves and dissolves. Thus,  Mahamati, when the Manovijnana is got rid of, the seven Vijnanas are  also got rid of. So it is said: 
 
179. I enter not into Nirvana by means of being, of work, of  individual signs; I enter into Nirvana when the Vijnana which is caused  by discrimination ceases. 
 
180. With it [i. e. the Manovijnana] for its cause and support, the  Manas secures its use; the Vijnana causes the Citta to function, and is  supported [by it]. 
 
181. Like a great flood where no waves are stirred because of its  being dried up, the Vijnana [-system] in its various forms ceases to  work when there is the annihilation [of the Manovijnana].

Further, Mahamati, I will tell you about the various features of the  false imagination (<em>parikalpita</em>); and when you and the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas are well acquainted with each of them in its  specific form, you will get away from discrimination; and seeing well  and knowing the way of inner realisation by noble wisdom and also the  ways of speculation by the philosophers, (<a name="128"><strong>128</strong></a>)  you will cast off discriminations such as grasped and grasping, and will  not be induced to discriminate in respect to the multiple aspects of  relativity-knowledge (<em>paratantra</em>), as well as the forms of the  false imagination. What are the various features of the false  imagination, Mahamati? They are the discriminations as regards (1) words  (<em>abhilapa</em>), (2) meaning, (3) individual marks, (4) property, (5)  self-nature, (6) cause, (7) philosophical views, (8) reasoning, (9)  birth, (10) no-birth, (11) dependence, and (12) bondage and  emancipation. These, Mahamati, are the various features of the false  imagination. 
 
Now, Mahamati, what is the discrimination of words? That is the  becoming attached to various sweet voices and singing—this is the  discrimination as regards words. 
 
What is the discrimination of meaning? It is the discrimination by  which one imagines that words rise depending on whatever subjects they  express, and which subjects one regards as self-existent and belonging  to the realisation of noble wisdom. 
 
What is the discrimination of individual marks? It is to imagine in  whatever is denoted by words the multitudinousness of individual marks  which are like a mirage, and, clinging tenaciously to them, to  discriminate all things according to these categories: warmth, fluidity,  motility, and solidity. 
 
What is the discrimination of property? It is to desire a state of  wealth such as gold, silver, and various precious stones. 
 
What is the discrimination of self-nature? It is to make  discrimination according to the imaginary views of the philosophers in  reference to the self-nature of all things (<a name="129"><strong>129</strong></a>)  which they stoutly maintain, saying, "This is just it, and there is no  other." 
 
What is the discrimination of cause? That is, to distinguish the  notion of causation in reference to being and non-being and to imagine  that there are cause-signs—this is the discrimination of cause. 
 
What is the discrimination of philosophical views? That means getting  attached to the philosophers' wrong views and discriminations  concerning such notions as being and non-being, oneness and otherness,  bothness and not-bothness. 
 
What is the discrimination of reasoning? It means the teaching whose  reasoning is based on the grasping of the notion of an ego-substance and  what belongs to it. 
 
What is the discrimination of birth? It means getting attached to the  notion that things come into existence and go out of it according to  causation. 
 
What is the discrimination of no-birth? It is to discriminate that  all things are from the beginning unborn, that the causeless substances  which were not, come into existence by reason of causation. 
 
What is the discrimination of dependence? It means the mutual  dependence of gold and the filament [which is made of gold]. 
 
What is the discrimination of bondage and emancipation? It is like  imagining that there is something bound because of something binding as  in the case of a man who by the help of a cord ties a knot or loosens  it. 
 
These, Mahamati, are the various features of the false imagination,  to which all the ignorant and simple-minded ones cling, imagining that  things are or are not. Those attached to the notion of relativity are  attached to the notion of multitudinousness of things rising from the  false imagination. It is like seeing varieties of objects depending on  Maya, but these varieties thus revealing themselves are discriminated by  the ignorant as something other than Maya itself according to their way  of thinking. (<a name="130"><strong>130</strong></a>) Now, Mahamati, Maya and  varieties of objects are neither different nor one. If they were  different, varieties of objects would not have Maya for their cause. If  Maya were one with varieties of objects, there would be no distinction  between the two, but as there is the distinction these two—Maya and  varieties of objects—are neither one nor different. For this reason you  and the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas should never give yourselves up to the  notion of being and non-being.

So it is said: 
 
182. The Citta is bound up with the objective world; the intellect's  function is to speculate; and in the excellent state of imagelessness  there is the evolving of transcendental wisdom (<em>prajna</em>). 
 
183. According to the false imagination, [self-substance] is, but  from the point of view of relativity (<em>paratantra</em>) it is not;  owing to perversion, what is discriminated is grasped [as real]; in the  relativity there is no discrimination. 
 
184. Multitudinousness of differentiations is imagined [as real by  the ignorant], but being like Maya they obtain not; varieties of  individual forms are discriminated as such, but they [really] do not  obtain. 
 
185. [To imagine] individual forms is wrong, it puts one in bondage;  they are born of Mind due to the false imagination of the ignorant;  based on the relativity they are discriminated. 
 
186. The existence thus subjected to discrimination is no other than  its relativity aspect; (<a name="131"><strong>131</strong></a>) the false  imagination is of various forms; based on the relativity, discrimination  is carried on. 
 
187. Conventional truth (<em>samvriti</em>) and ultimate truth (<em>paramartha</em>)—if  there be a third, non-entity is its cause; the false imagination  belongs to the conventional; when it is cut asunder, there is the realm  of the wise. 
 
188. As to the Yogins there is one reality which reveals itself as  multiplicity and yet there is no multiplicity in it; so is the nature of  the false imagination. 
 
189. As by the dim-eyed a variety of objects is seen and imagined  while the dimness itself is neither a form (<em>rupa</em>) nor a no-form (<em>arupa</em>),  so is the relativity [discriminated] by the unknowing ones. 
 
190. As is pure gold, water free from dirt, the sky without a cloud,  so is [the Mind] pure when detached_1_ from the false  imagination. 
 
191. Falsely-imagined existence is not, but from the relativity point  of view it is, assertion and refutation are destroyed when one is freed  from the imagination. 
 
192. If the relativity-aspect of existence is, while the imagination  is not, this means that there is a being apart from being and that a  being is born of a non-being. 
 
193. Depending on the false imagination there obtains the  relativity-aspect of existence; from the conjunction of form and name  there rises false imagination. 
 
194. False imagination can never be perfect knowledge (<em>nishpanna</em>),  it is not productive of anything else [but itself]; (<a name="132"><strong>132</strong></a>)  then one knows what is meant by ultimate truth whose self-nature is  purity. 
 
195. There are ten kinds_2_ of false imagination and six  kinds of relativity; in the knowledge of Tathata innerly attained there  is no differentiation. 
 
196. Truth consists in [knowing] the five Dharmas and also the three  Svabhavas; when the Yogin thus comprehends [the truth], he does not  transgress Tathata. 
 
197. According to the form of relativity, there are those names that  belong to false imagination; and the various aspects of false  imagination arise from relativity. 
 
_1_ Throughout the text, <em>vikalpa</em> is translated  "discrimination" or "imagination," but here the term is evidently used  as negating the function of <em>kalpita</em> which stands in these verses  for <em>parikalpita</em>. 
 
_2_ All the Chinese texts have "twelve" instead of "ten." 
 
198. When well pondered with intelligence (<em>buddhi</em>) there is  neither relativity nor false imagination; where perfect knowledge is,  there is nothing [dualistically] existent; for how with intelligence can  discrimination take place? 
 
199. Where perfect knowledge is, the existent cannot be qualified  with being and non-being; in what cannot be qualified with being and  non-being, how can there be these two Svabhavas? 
 
200. Because of false imagination, the two Svabhavas are established;  where there is false imagination multitudinousness of things is  recognised, which being purified the [spiritual] condition of the wise  obtains. 
 
201. Where there is false imagination there is multitudinousness of  objects, which are discriminated under the aspect of relativity; if  otherwise discriminated, one becomes attached to the teachings of the  philosophers. 
 
202. What is imagined being subjected to further imagination, there  are various views from which rises the doctrine of causal origination; (<a name="133"><strong>133</strong></a>) when the dualistic discrimination is got rid  of, there indeed is perfect knowledge._1_ 
 
_1_ This whole section treats of the threefold Svabhava,  chiefly explaining where Parikalpita (false imagination) is  differentiated from Paratantra (relativity view). While the explanation  sometimes appears quite complicated, the main point is clear enough. The  Kalpita is a net of wrong interpretations woven about the Paratantra,  which is the dualistic view of existence, and which is valid as far as  it goes. But to reach the Nishpanna (perfect knowledge) it is necessary  to transcend all forms of dualism, for the Paratantra is by no means  ultimate truth.

Further, Mahamati said: Pray tell me, Blessed One, about the one  vehicle that characterises the inner realisation of noble wisdom,  whereby, Blessed One, I and other Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas, becoming  conversant with the one vehicle which marks the inner attainment of  noble wisdom, may be established without depending on anybody else in  the teaching of the Buddha. 
 
Said the Blessed One: Then, Mahamati, listen well and reflect within  yourself as I tell you. 
 
Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said, Yes, I will, Blessed One;  and gave ear to the Blessed One. 
 
Thereupon the Blessed One said: In accordance with the authoritative  teachings in which there are no discriminations, Mahamati, let the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva retire by himself to a quiet secluded place,  where he may reflect within himself, not relying on anybody else, but by  means of his own inner intelligence, in order to discard erroneous  views and discriminations, make successive advances and exert himself to  finally enter upon the stage of Tathagatahood. This, Mahamati, is the  characteristic feature of the inner realisation to be gained by means of  noble wisdom. 
 
What characterises the way of the one vehicle? I call it the one  vehicle because thereby one recognises and realises the path leading to  the one vehicle. How is this path of the one vehicle to be recognised  and realised? The recognition of the one vehicle is obtained when there  is no rising of discrimination by doing away with the notion of grasped  and grasping and by abiding in the reality of suchness (<em>yathabhuta</em>).  Mahamati, this recognition of the one vehicle, (<a name="134"><strong>134</strong></a>)  except by the Tathagata himself, has never been obtained before by  anybody else—the philosophers, Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, Brahmans, etc.  For this reason, Mahamati, this is known as the one vehicle. 
 
Mahamati said: For what reason is it that the Blessed One speaks of  the triple vehicle and not of the one vehicle? 
 
The Blessed One replied: Because there is no teaching whereby the  Sravakas and Pratyekabuddhas can realise Nirvana by themselves, I do not  speak of the one vehicle. Thus, Mahamati, the Sravakas and  Pratyekabuddhas are disciplined, segregated, and trained in meditation  according to the discourse of the Tathagata, whereby they are led to  emancipation and not by themselves. 
 
Further, Mahamati, as they have not yet destroyed the habit-energy  (memory) of karma and the hindrance of knowledge, all the Sravakas and  Pratyekabuddhas are unable to realise the egolessness of things and have  not attained the inconceivable transformation-death, I preach to the  Sravakas [and Pratyekabuddhas] the triple vehicle and not the one  vehicle._1_ When, Mahamati, destroying all the evil  habit-energy, they realise the egolessness of things, they who are now  free from the evil habit-energy will not be intoxicated by the Samadhis  and will be awakened into the realm of no-evil-outflows. Now being taken  into a super-world which is the realm of no-evil-outflows, they will  gather up all the material for the attainment of the Dharmakaya which is  of severeign power and beyond conception. So it is said: 
 
203. The Deva vehicle, the Brahma vehicle, the Sravaka vehicle, (<a name="135"><strong>135</strong></a>) the Pratyekabuddha vehicle, and the Tathagata  vehicle, of these I speak. 
 
204. So long as there is a mind making conscious efforts, there can  be no culmination as regards the various vehicles; when a revulsion  takes place in the mind, there is neither a vehicle nor one who rides in  it. 
 
205. There is really no establishment of various vehicles, and so I  speak of the one vehicle;_2_ but in order to carry the ignorant  I talk of a variety of vehicles. 
 
_1_ Transfer <em>naikayanam</em> (line 9) to line 10 after <em>yanatrayam</em>. 
 
_2_ According to the Chinese translations. 
 
206. There are three emancipations, and in all things there is no  ego-substance; knowledge and passions are of the same nature, when [one  is] emancipated they are discarded. 
 
207. Like a piece of wood floating on the waves of the ocean, the  Sravaka obsessed with individual marks is driven along [the stream of  existence]. 
 
208. Though disengaged from the actively-functioning passions, they  [the Sravakas] are still bound up with the habit-energy of the passions;  intoxicated with the liquor of the Samadhi, they still have their abode  in the realm of outflows. 
 
209. In this there is no course of finality, nor retrogression  either; [losing himself] in the attainment of the Samadhi-body, he is  not at all awakened even to the end of kalpas. 
 
210. Like unto the drunkard who, being awakened from his  intoxication, regains his intelligence, [the Sravakas] will have the  realisation of the Buddha's truth, which is his own body.

(<a name="136"><strong>136</strong></a>) At that time again the Blessed One  said this to Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva: I will tell you,  Mahamati, about the various forms of the will-body; listen well and  reflect well within yourself. I will tell you. 
 
Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said; I will, Blessed One, and  gave ear to the Blessed One. 
 
The Blessed One then said this: There are three kinds of will-body,  Mahamati. What are the three? They are: (1) the will-body obtained in  the enjoyment of the Samadhi; (2) the will-body obtained by recognising  the self-nature of the Dharma; and (3) the will-body which is assumed  [by a Bodhisattva according to] the class of beings [to be saved] and  which perfects and achieves [without a thought of its own achievement].  By realising the higher stages successively after the first is attained,  the Yogin will experience them [all]. 
 
Now, Mahamati, what is the will-body attained in the enjoyment of the  Samadhi? It is this: when [the Yogin] in the third, fourth, fifth  stages removes the various discriminations going on in his mind and is  at rest,_1_ the waves of consciousness are no more stirred in  the Mind-ocean and the Vijnana functions are quieted, the bliss of which  is enjoyed by him; and when he thus recognises the non-existence of the  external world, which is no more than his own mind, he is said to have  the will-body._2_ 
 
_1_ It will be interesting for the Chinese readers of the <em>Lankavatara</em> to notice that the compound, <em>svacitta-vividha-viveka-vihara,</em> is  here read in three different ways by the three Chinese translators,  showing how variously a Sanskrit compound allows itself to be  interpreted. This is one of numerous such examples to be met with  throughout the text. 
 
Sung: 種種自心寂靜安. The mind itself, variously  [discriminating], grows quiet and finds its rest. 
 
Wei: 自心寂靜行種種行. The mind itself is quiet and  practises various deeds. 
 
T'ang: 離種種心寂然不動. Discarding various  [mentations], the mind is quiet and immovable. 
 
_2_ Page 136, line 14, delete <em>abhava</em> and <em>manaso</em>. 
 
(<a name="137"><strong>137</strong></a>) What is the will-body obtained by  recognising the self-nature of the Dharma? When [the Yogin] of the  eighth stage has a thoroughgoing penetration into the nature of things  which is like Maya and not image-producing, he experiences a revulsion  at the seat of consciousness and obtains the Samadhi known as Maya-like  and other Samadhis. By entering upon the Samadhis he gains a body which  exhibits various powers of self-mastery and supernatural activity, which  moves according to his wish as quickly as a flower opens up, which  resembles Maya, a dream, and a reflected image, and which is not a  product of the elements but has something analogous to what is produced  of the elements, which is furnished with all the differences  appertaining to the world of forms and yet is able to follow up all the  assemblages in the Buddha-lands. This is the body which has a  thoroughgoing knowledge of the self-nature of the Dharma and for this  reason is called will-body. 
 
Now what is the will-body which is born in accordance with the class  and which perfects and achieves? When [the Yogin] is thoroughly  conversant with all the characteristics of self-realisation and its  bliss which pervades the teachings of the Buddha, he is said to have the  body which is will-made, born with [the class], perfecting and  achieving. Mahamati, you should exert yourself in order to have a  thoroughly penetrating knowledge of these three marks of the will-body.  So it is said: 
 
1. My Mahayana is neither a vehicle, nor a sound, nor words; it is  neither the truth, nor emancipation, nor the realm of imagelessness. 
 
2. Yet the Mahayana is a vehicle on which the Samadhis are carried  leading to various creative activities; the several forms of the  will-body are adorned with the flowers of the sovereign will.

(<a name="138"><strong>138</strong></a>) At that time again Mahamati the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said this to the Blessed One: The five  immediacies are preached by the Blessed One; and what are these five,  Blessed One, which being committed by a son or a daughter of a good  family cause them to fall into the Avici hell? 
 
The Blessed One replied: Then, Mahamati, listen well and reflect, for  I will tell you. 
 
Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said; Certainly, Blessed One, and  gave ear to the Blessed One. 
 
The Blessed One said thus to him: What are the five immediacies? They  are: (1) the murdering of the mother, (2) of the father, (3) of the  Arhat, (4) the breaking-up of the Brotherhood, and (5) causing the body  of the Tathagata to bleed from malice. 
 
Now what is meant by the mother of all beings? It is desire which is  procreative, going together with joy and anger and upholding all with  motherliness. Ignorance representing fatherhood brings about one's  rebirth in the six villages of the sense-world. When there takes place a  complete destruction of both roots, fatherhood and motherhood, it is  said that mother and father are murdered. When there is a complete  extermination of the subordinate group of passions such as anger, etc.,  which are like an enemy, a venomous rat, the murdering of the Arhat is  said to take place. What is meant by the breaking-up of the Brotherhood?  When there is a complete fundamental breaking-up of the combination of  the Skandhas whose characteristic mark is a state of mutual dependence  among dissimilarities, it is said that the Brotherhood is split up. (<a name="139"><strong>139</strong></a>) Mahamati, when the body of the eight  Vijnanas, which erroneously recognises individuality and generality as  being outside the Mind—which is seen [by the ignorant] in the form of an  external world—is completely extirpated by means of faulty  discriminations, that is, by means of the triple emancipation and the  non-outflows, and when thus the faulty mentality of the Vijnana-Buddha  is made to bleed, it is known as an immediacy-deed. These, 
 
Mahamati, are the five inner immediacies, and when they are  experienced by a son or a daughter of a good family, there is an  immediacy-deed of realisation as regards the Dharma. 
 
Further, Mahamati, there are five external immediacies which I will  point out to you, in order that you and other Bodhisattvas in the future  may thereby be saved from ignorance. What are these five? They are  those immediacies which are described in the canonical texts, and those  who commit these crimes can never experience any one of these  manifestations, except those Transformation [-Buddhas] who are sustained  by the power [of the Tathagatas] and have already attained a  realisation. The Sravakas of transformation, Mahamati, who are sustained  by the sustaining power either of the Bodhisattvas or Tathagatas, may  see somebody else practising deeds of wickedness, and they will  repeatedly make great efforts to turn him away from his wickness and  faulty views, and to make him realise the non-reality of wickedness and  faulty views by laying down his burden. This is the way I demonstrate  facts of the transformation, the sustaining power, and the realisation.  Mahamati, there is, however, no realisation for those who are sheer  offenders of the immediacies, (<a name="140"><strong>140</strong></a>) except when  they come to the recognition of the truth that an external world is  nothing but_1_ the Mind itself, seeing that body, property, and  abiding place are discriminations, and that the notion of an ego and  its belongings are to be kept away; or, when they are released from the  fault of self-discrimination by encountering a good friend at some time  or other, or at any time, and being born in some other path of  existence. So it is said: 
 
3. Desire is said to be the mother and ignorance the father; the  Vijnana which recognises an objective world is [compared to] the Buddha. 
 
4. The secondary group of passions is the Arhat, the amassing of the  five Skandhas the Brotherhood; as these are to be destroyed immediately  they are known as immediacy-deeds.

Again Mahamati said: Pray tell me, Blessed One, what makes the  Buddhas and the Blessed Ones such as they are: that is, [what is] the  Buddha-nature of the Buddhas?_1_ 
 
Said the Blessed One: when the egolessness of things as well as of  persons is understood, when the knowledge of the twofold hindrance is  thoroughly taken hold of, when the twofold death (<em>cyuti</em>) is  accomplished, and when the twofold group of passions is destroyed,  there, Mahamati, is the Buddha-nature of the Buddhas and the Blessed  Ones. When these teachings are experienced by the Sravakas and  Pratyekabuddhas, this is their Buddha-nature. So it is said: 
 
5. The twofold egolessness, the twofold group of passions, the  twofold hindrance, and the inconceivable transformation-death, —when  these are attained, there is the Tathagata.

(<a name="141"><strong>141</strong></a>) At that time again, Mahamati the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said this to the Blessed One: According to what  deeper sense_2_ did you make this announcement before the  congregation, that "I am all the Buddhas of the past," and that "I have  gone through many a birth in varieties of forms, being thus at times the  king Mandhatri, Elephant, Parrot, Indra, Vyasa, Sunetra, and other  beings in my one hundred thousand births?" 
 
Said the Blessed One: There are, according to the deeper sense, four  kinds of sameness distinguished, Mahamati, and the Tathagatas, Arhats,  Fully-Enlightened Ones make this assertion: I was thus at that time the  Buddha Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni, and Kasyapa. What are the four kinds of  sameness which are distinguished according to the deeper sense? They  are: (1) sameness of letters, (2) sameness of words, (3) sameness of  teachings, and (4) sameness of the body. According to this fourfold  sameness in the deeper sense, the Tathagatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened  Ones make the announcement before the congregation. 
 
_2_ <em>Samdhaya.</em> There is no reference to this in Wei  and Sung. The term has a special sense here and elsewhere in the <em>Lankavatara</em>. 
 
Now, Mahamati, what is the sameness of letters? It is that my name is  [spelt] B-u-d-d-h-a, and these letters are also used for other Buddhas  and Blessed Ones; Mahamati, these letters in their nature are not to be  distinguished one from another; therefore, Mahamati, there is the  sameness of letters. 
 
Now, Mahamati, what is the sameness of words with regard to the  Tathagatas, Arhats, and (<a name="142"><strong>142</strong></a>) Fully-Enlightened  Ones? It is that sixty-four sounds of the Brahman language are  distinguished by me, and these identical sixty-four sounds of the  Brahman language are also uttered by the Tathagatas, Arhats, and  Fully-Enlightened Ones, and their Kalavinka-like notes are the same with  all of us, as we are indistinguishable in this respect. 
 
Now, Mahamati, what is the sameness of the body? It is that I and  other Tathagatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones are the same as regards  our Dharmakaya and the [thirty-two] signs and the [eighty] minor  excellencies of bodily perfection—no distinction existing among us,  except that the Tathagatas manifest varieties of forms according to the  different dispositions of beings, who are to be disciplined by varieties  of means. 
 
Now, Mahamati, what is the sameness of the teaching? It is that I as  well as they [other Tathagatas] are all conversant with the teachings  belonging to the thirty-seven branches of enlightenment. According to  the deeper sense which is concerned with this fourfold sameness, the  Tathagatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones make their announcement  before the congregation. So it is said: 
 
6. "I am Kasyapa, Krakucchanda, and Kanakamuni"; this I preach who  come out of the sameness for the sake of the sons of the Buddha.

Again Mahamati said: It is said by the Blessed One that from the  night of the Enlightenment till the night of the Parinirvana, the  Tathagata (<a name="143"><strong>143</strong></a>) in the meantime has not uttered  even a word, nor will he ever utter; for not-speaking is the Buddha's  speaking. According to what deeper sense is it that not-speaking is the  Buddha's speaking? 
 
The Blessed One replied: By reason of two things of the deeper sense,  Mahamati, this statement is made. What are the two things: They are the  truth of self-realisation and an eternally-abiding reality. According  to these two things of the deeper sense the statement is made by me. Of  what deeper sense is the truth of self-realisation? What has been  realised by the Tathagatas, that is my own realisation, in which there  is neither decreasing nor increasing; for the realm of self-realisation  is free from words and discriminations, having nothing to do with  dualistic terminology. 
 
What is meant by an eternally-abiding reality? The ancient road of  reality, Mahamati, has been here all the time, like gold, silver, or  pearl preserved in the mine, Mahamati; the Dharmadhatu abides foreover,  whether the Tathagata appears in the world or not; as the Tathagata  eternally abides so does the reason (<em>dharmata</em>) of all things;  reality foreover abides, reality keeps its order, like the roads in an  ancient city. For instance, Mahamati, a man who is walking in a forest  and discovering an ancient city with its orderly streets may enter into  the city, and having entered into it, he may have a rest, conduct  himself like a citizen, and enjoy all the pleasures accruing therefrom. (<a name="144"><strong>144</strong></a>) What do you think, Mahamati? Did this man  make the road along which he enters into the city, and also the various  things in the city? 
 
Mahamati said: No, Blessed One. 
 
The Blessed One said: Just so, Mahamati, what has been realised by  myself and other Tathagatas is this reality, the eternally-abiding  reality (<em>sthitita</em>), the self-regulating reality (<em>niyamata</em>),  the suchness of things (<em>tathata</em>), the realness of things (<em>bhutata</em>),  the truth itself (<em>satyata</em>). For this reason, Mahamati, it is  stated by me that from the night of the Tathagata's Enlightenment till  the night of his entrance into Nirvana, he has not in the meantime  uttered, nor ever will utter, one word. So it is said: 
 
7. From the night of Enlightenment till that of Nirvana, I have not  in the meantime made any proclamation whatever._1_ 
 
8. It is on account of the deeper meaning that the eternally-abiding  reality of self-realisation is talked of by me; and between myself and  [all the other] Buddhas, in this respect, there is no distinction  whatever. 
 
<div>_1_ The Zen masters frequently refer to this important  declaration.</div>

At that time, Mahamati made this request of the Blessed One: Pray  tell me, Blessed One, about the being and non-being of all things; and  when myself and other Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas are freed of the notions  of being and non-being, may we quickly attain supreme enlightenment. 
 
(<a name="145"><strong>145</strong></a>) The Blessed One replied: Then,  Mahamati, listen well and reflect well within yourself; I will tell you. 
 
Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said, Certainly, Blessed One, and  gave ear to the Blessed One. 
 
Then the Blessed One said: People of this world are dependent on two  things, Mahamati, that is, they are dependent on the idea of being and  on that of non-being, and they fall into the views whereby they take  pleasure either in nihilism or in realism. They imagine emancipation  where there is no emancipation. 
 
Now, Mahamati, who are the people dependent on the notion of being?  It means this that they regard the world as rising from causation which  is really existent, and that the actually existing and becoming world  does not take its rise from causation which is non-existent. This will  not be the case if the world is something non-existing. They thus talk  of the really-existing world as arising from the reality of causation.  This is the realistic view of causation as held by some people. 
 
Now, Mahamati, what is meant by being dependent upon the idea of  non-being? It means, Mahamati, admitting greed, anger, and folly, and  yet discriminating as regards the non-reality of what makes up greed,  anger, and folly; and, Mahamati, there is one who does not admit the  reality of things because of their being devoid of individual marks; and  there is another who, seeing that the Buddhas, Sravakas, and  Pratyekabuddhas are free from greed, anger, and folly, because of all  things being devoid of individual marks, [think that greed, anger, and  folly] do not exist. 
 
Now, Mahamati, who of these is the one doomed to ruin? 
 
Said Mahamati; Blessed One, it is he who, admitting greed, anger, and  folly, yet refuses to admit them. 
 
(<a name="146"><strong>146</strong></a>) The Blessed One said: Well said  indeed, Mahamati! Again thou hast indeed spoken well, Mahamati! Not only  is he himself doomed to ruin because of his notion of greed, anger, and  folly as existent and yet as not-existent, but he ruins even the  character of the Buddha, the Sravaka, and the Pratyekabuddha. Why?  Because the passions are not to be taken hold of innerly and outwardly,  because they are neither different nor not-different. Mahamati, greed,  anger, and folly too are not to be taken hold of innerly as well as  outwardly; they have no substance of their own and they are not to be  admitted; Mahamati, as there is no reality in the nature of greed,  anger, and folly, [he who fails to understand this] is the one who ruins  the character of the Buddha, Sravaka, and Pratyekabuddha. The Buddha,  Sravaka, and Pratyekabuddha are by nature emancipated as there is in  them no cause for being bound and binding; Mahamati, [on the other  hand,] where there is a state of being bound there are the binding and  the cause of bondage. [And yet there is] one who talks thus, [that is,  denies causation]; such is doomed to ruin. Mahamati, this characterises  nihilism and realism. 
 
This is stated by me in accordance with the deeper sense. It is  better to cherish the notion of an ego-substance as much as Mount Sumeru  than to have the notion of emptiness derived from the self-conceited  view of being and non-being. One who is conceited in the view of being  and non-being is indeed doomed to ruin. Those who are delighted in  cherishing notions of individuality and generality fail to understand  that an external world is nothing but Mind itself and has no reality;  and as they do not understand this they regard things external as  transient, for they suffer every moment changes which follow one after  another, now splitting, now dividing, while the Skandhas, Dhatus, and  Ayatanas succeeding one another and combining with one another, now come  forward and (<a name="147"><strong>147</strong></a>) now pass away. They who thus  disregarding words of the scriptures are given up to wrong  discriminations are also doomed to ruin. So it is said: 
 
9. As far as the duality of being and non-being extends, there is the  realm of intellection; when this realm vanishes, intellection  completely ceases. 
 
10. When the external world is not grasped [as real] there is neither  causation nor reality; there is the essence of suchness (<em>thatata</em>),  which is the [spiritual] realm of the wise. 
 
11. Those who believe in the birth of something that has never been  in existence and, coming to exist, finally vanishes away, —which leads  them to assert that things come to exist, things pass away, according to  causation, —such people have no foothold in my teaching. 
 
12. It is not by the philosophers, not by the Buddhas, not by myself,  not by anybody else, but by causation that being obtains; how can one  talk of non-being? 
 
13. When being obtains by causation, who can bring about non-being?  By reason of the wrong views based on the doctrine of birth, being and  non-being are discriminated. 
 
14. When it is realised that there is nothing born, nothing passing  away, there is no way to admit its being and not-being; the world is to  be regarded as quiescent.

At that time again Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva requested of  the Blessed One, saying: Pray point out to me, Blessed One; pray point  out to me, Sugata; pray point out to me, Tathagata, Arhat,  Fully-Enlightened One! Pray tell me, Most Excellent One! (<a name="148"><strong>148</strong></a>)  What is the characteristic of the realisation by which I and other  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas, becoming thoroughly conversant with its  meaning, may quickly attain the highest enlightenment, and, relying upon  themselves, will not be led away by any speculations or philosophies? 
 
Said the Blessed One: Then listen well, Mahamati, and well reflect  within yourself; I will tell you. 
 
Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said; Certainly, I will; and gave  ear to the Blessed One. 
 
Thereupon the Blessed One said this: There are two ways of  characterising the realisation attained by all the Sravakas, the  Pratyekabuddhas, and the Bodhisattvas: the realisation itself and the  teaching [about it]. Now, Mahamati, by the realisation itself is meant  that it is the realm of inner attainment; its characteristic features  are that it has nothing to do with words, discriminations, and letters;  that it leads one up to the realm of non-outflows; that it is the state  of an inner experience; that it is entirely devoid of philosophical  speculations and [the doings of] evil beings; and that, destroying  philosophical speculations and [the doings of] evil beings, it shines  out in its own inner light of attainment. These, Mahamati, are the  characteristics of the realisation. 
 
Now, Mahamati, what is meant by the teaching [concerning it]? It is  variously given in the nine divisions of the doctrinal works; it keeps  one away from the dualistic notions of being and non-being, of oneness  and otherness; first making use of skilful means and expedients, it  induces all beings to have a perception [of this teaching] so that  whoever is inclined towards it, may be instructed in it. This, Mahamati,  is the characteristic of the teaching. Let, therefore, Mahamati, you  and other Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas (<a name="149"><strong>149</strong></a>) exert  yourselves in this. 
 
15. Realisation and teaching, self-attainment and doctrinal  instruction—those who have an insight into the difference will not be  led away by philosophical authorities. 
 
16. There is no truth in any object that is imagined by the ignorant;  deliverance is where there is no objective world; why is this not  sought by the speculators? 
 
17. The world of the Samskritas is observed as the continuation of  birth-and-death, whereby dualisms are nourished, and because of this  perversion [the truth] is not perceived. 
 
18. There is just one truth, which is Nirvana—it has nothing to do  with the Manas (intellection); the world seen as subject to  discrimination resembles a plantain tree, a dream,_1_ a vision. 
 
19. No greed there is, no anger, nor folly either, and again, no  personal ego; from desire start the Skandhas, which resemble a dream.

At that time again Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva requested of  the Blessed One, saying: Pray tell me, Blessed One, pray tell me,  Sugata, regarding what characterises wrong discrimination (<em>abhutaparikalpa</em>).  Blessed One, tell me as to the how, what, why, and who of wrong  discrimination, which, when rising and going on, constitutes what is  known as wrong discrimination; that is to say, to what kind of thought  is the term wrong discrimination applicable? or what kind of  discrimination is to be called wrong? 
 
(<a name="150"><strong>150</strong></a>) The Blessed One said: Well said, well  said, Mahamati; and again, well said, indeed, Mahamati! You who have  been admitted [into the order of Bodhisattvas], Mahamati, think of this  matter which is worth asking about, for the welfare of many people, for  the happiness of many people, because of your compassion for the world,  for the benefit of the multitudes, for the welfare and happiness of  celestial beings and humankind. Therefore, Mahamati, listen well and  reflect well within yourself as I tell you. 
 
Certainly, Blessed One; said Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva, and  gave ear to the Blessed One. 
 
Then the Blessed One said thus to him: When the multitudinousness of  objects is wrongly imagined [as real] and attached to, discrimination  goes on evolving; and, Mahamati, as people are attached tenaciously to  the notion of grasping, as they have not ascertained in their minds as  to the nature of the objective world which is no more than the Mind  itself, as they have fallen into the dualistic view of being and  non-being, and, Mahamati, as they are nourished by the habit-energy of  the views and discriminations of the philosophers, they perceive the  multitudinousness of external objects [as real] and become attached to  them; and for this reason a system of mentation—mind and what belongs to  it —is discriminated and is spoken of [as real], and with the assertion  of an ego-soul and its belongings, the system goes on functioning. 
 
Said Mahamati: As you say, Blessed One, when the multitudinousness of  external objects is wrongly imagined [as real] and attached to by  people, discrimination goes evolving on; and they fall into the  dualistic view of being and non-being,_1_ they nourish the  views and discriminations of the philosophers which are based on the  notion of grasped and grasping; (<a name="151"><strong>151</strong></a>) and as  they perceive the multitudinousness of external objects [as real] and  become attached to them, a system of mentation—mind and what belongs to  it —is discriminated and is spoken of [as real] and goes on functioning  owing to the fact that the external world is not recognised as nothing  but the Mind itself, and that the multitudinousness of things is  tenaciously clung to as subject to [the notion of] being and non-being.  This being the case, Blessed One, the multitudinousness of external  objects which is characterised with the dualism of being and non-being,  is to be said neither existent nor non-existent, and does not render  itself to the formation of the philosophical views. [Inasmuch as the  external world owes its existence to discrimination, it in itself must  be said to be devoid of all forms of dualism.] Blessed One, in the same  way the highest reality is declared to be devoid of [all forms of  logical analysis such as] the means of proof, sense-perception,  syllogistic arguments, illustration, reasoning, etc. How is it, Blessed  One, that while, on the one hand, the discrimination of multiplicity is  said to go on operating on the strength of the attachment which attaches  itself to the multiplicity of external unrealities, the attachment, on  the other hand, to the highest reality does not give rise to  discrimination which goes on functioning in its own way? Is it not,  Blessed One, unfair reasoning on your part to say, "It gives rise [to  discrimination]" in one place, and to say in another place, "It does  not"? _2_According to the Blessed One, depending on and  attaching to the dualism of being and non-being, there evolve views  characteristic of wrong discrimination as when the magician produces  varieties of people that are not at all real and complete objects. Thus  signs of existence and non-existence are falsely imagined and go on so  imagined; [but in fact existence itself is] devoid of discrimination. If  so, how does one come to cherish the dualism as held by a man of the  world? 
 
_1_ This is omitted in T'ang. 
 
_2_ The whole passage below does not appear in Sung. The  text seems to be confused and it is difficult to make out what it really  means. The present translation is merely tentative. It mainly follows  the T'ang interpretation; Wei gives no sense as far as one can see. 
 
Said the Blessed One: Mahamati, discrimination, indeed, does not  evolve, nor is it put away. Why? Because there is no evolving of  discrimination as regards being and non-being; because the perception of  objective realities is not real; because all that is seen is to be  recognised as nothing but the Mind itself. (<a name="152"><strong>152</strong></a>)  Mahamati, discrimination does not evolve, nor is it put away. But,  Mahamati, for the sake of the ignorant who are addicted to  discriminating the multiplicity of things which are of their own Mind,  it is said by me that discrimination whose first function is to produce  effects takes its rise owing to the attachment to the aspect of  multiplicity as characteristic of objects. How otherwise, Mahamati, can  the ignorant and simple-minded have an insight into the Mind itself  which they discriminate, and see themselves freed from the notion of an  ego and what belongs to it, and also freed from the wrong conception of  cause and effect? And, again, how can they recognise that there is  nothing but Mind itself and cause a revulsion at the inmost seat of  consciousness (<em>cittasraya</em>)? How can they have a clear perception  of all the stages and attain the inner realisation of the Tathagatas,  which transcends the five Dharmas, the three Svabhavas, and the idea of  reality as well as discrimination? For this reason, Mahamati, I state  that discrimination takes its rise from our attachment to the  multiplicity of objects which are not real, and that emancipation comes  from our thoroughly understanding the meaning of reality as it is and  also the meaning of multiplicity of things which evolve from  discrimination. So it is said: 
 
20. Those who, regarding the world as evolving from causes and  conditions, are attached to these notions as well as to the fourfold  proposition, fail to understand my teaching. 
 
21. The world cannot be predicated anywhere as being, or as  non-being, or as being-and-non-being, as is discriminated by the  ignorant who regard it as subject to causes and conditions, 
 
22. When the world is seen [to be unpredicable with such notions as]  being, non-being, or being-and-non-being, (<a name="153"><strong>153</strong></a>)  a change takes place in the mind, and egolessness is attained. 
 
23. All things are unborn because they are born of causation;  anything that is born of causation is an effect, and from an effect  nothing is produced. 
 
24. From an effect no effect is produced; [if you assert this,] you  commit the fault of a double effect; and this double effect being  untenable, no existence comes from an effect. 
 
25. When the Samskrita [i. e. anything produced] is regarded as free  from [the dualism of] depended and depending, there decidedly is  Mind-only, and hence my teaching of Mind-only. 
 
26. The [Mind as] norm is the abode of self-nature which has nothing  to do with a world of causation; of this norm which is perfect existence  and the highest Brahma, _1_ I speak. 
 
27. An ego-soul is a truth belonging to thought-construction, in  which there is no real reality; the self-nature of the Skandhas is also a  thought-construction, as there is no reality in it. 
 
_1_ The Chinese all have "the Pure" for this. Does it mean  "the Absolute" cleansed of all dualistic impurities? 
 
28. The sameness is of four kinds: individual forms, cause, the  coming into being,_1_ and the sameness of non-ego is the  fourth: these are subjects of discipline for the Yogins. 
 
29. [There is a state which is] removed from all philosophical views,  free from imagined and imagining, of no attainment, and of no  birth—this I call Mind-norm. 
 
30. Of neither existence nor non-existence do I speak, but of  Mind-only which has nothing to do with existence and non-existence, and  which is thus_2_ free from intellection. 
 
(<a name="154"><strong>154</strong></a>) 31. Suchness (<em>tathata</em>),  emptiness, realm of truth (<em>dharmadhatu</em>), the various forms of the  will-body— these I call Mind-only. 
 
32. Multiplicity of objects evolves from the conjunction of  habit-energy and discrimination; it is born of Mind, but is regarded by  people as existing outwardly: this I call Mind-only. 
 
33. The external world is not, and multiplicity of objects is what is  seen of Mind; body, property, and abode— these I call Mind-only.

At that time Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said this to the  Blessed One: This is said by the Blessed One that the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva and others should not grasp meaning [or reality, <em>artha</em>],  according to words. But, Blessed One, why should not the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva grasp meaning from words? What are words? What is  meaning? 
 
Said the Blessed One: Then, Mahamati, listen well and reflect within  yourself well; I will tell you. 
 
Thereupon said Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva, Certainly,  Blessed One; and gave ear to the Blessed One. 
 
The Blessed One then said this to him: Now, Mahamati, how is speech  produced? Depending on discrimination and habit-energy [or memory] as  the cause, there is the conjunction and the distinction of sounds and  letters, which, issuing from the teeth, jaws, palate, tongue, lips, and  the cavity of the mouth, make mutual conversations possible. This is  speech. Now, Mahamati, what is meaning? (<a name="155"><strong>155</strong></a>)  The Bodhisattva-Mahasattva is said to have grasped meaning well, when,  all alone in a lonely place, he walks the path leading to Nirvana, by  means of his transcendental wisdom (<em>prajna</em>) which grows from  learning, thinking, and meditation, and causing a revulsion first at the  source of habit-energy by his self-knowledge (<em>svabuddhi</em>), abides  on the stages of self-realisation where he leads a life full of  excellent deeds. 
 
Further, Mahamati, the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva who is conversant with  words and meaning observes that words are neither different nor  not-different from meaning and that meaning stands in the same relation  to words. If, Mahamati, meaning is different from words, it will not be  made manifest by means of words; but meaning is entered into by words as  things [are revealed] by a lamp. It is, Mahamati, like a man carrying a  lamp to look after his property. [By means of this light] he can say:  This is my property and so is kept in this place. Just so, Mahamati, by  means of the lamp of words and speech originating from discrimination,  the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas can enter into the exalted state of  self-realisation which is free from speech-discrimination. 
 
Further, Mahamati, if a man becomes attached to the [literal] meaning  or words and holds fast to their agreement in regard to the original  state of Nirvana which is unborn and undying, the Triple vehicle, the  one vehicle, the five [Dharmas], mentation, the [three] Svabhavas, etc.,  he will come to cherish views either affirmative or negative. As  varieties of objects are seen in Maya and are discriminated [as real],  statements are erroneously made, discriminations erroneously go on. (<a name="156"><strong>156</strong></a>) It is by the ignorant that discriminations  thus go on; it is otherwise with the wise._1_ 
 
_1_ The reading is move or less after T'ang. <em>Abhinivesam  pratitya</em> (p. 155, line 15) is dropped, and <em>tad yatha mahamate  anyatha hi maya-vaicitryam drashtavyam avyatha</em> (p. 155, line 17—p.  156, line 1) does not appear in T'ang, and as it is partly a repetition  of what precedes, not to speak of its making the whole passage obscure,  it is omitted in this translation. 
 
So it is said: 
 
34. _1_Those who following words, discriminate and assert  various notions, are bound for hell because of their assertions. 
 
35. The ego-soul is not with the Skandhas, nor are the Skandhas in  the ego-soul. They are not as they are discriminated, nor are they  otherwise. 
 
36. The reality of objects is seen being discriminated by the  ignorant; if it were so as they are seen, all would be seeing the truth. 
 
37. As all things are unreal, there is neither defilement nor purity;  things are not as they are seen, nor are they otherwise.

Further, Mahamati, I will tell you about the features of Jnana  (absolute knowledge) and Vijnana (relative knowledge)_2_; and  when you and other Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas are well conversant with  these distinctive features of Jnana and Vijnana, you will quickly  realise supreme enlightenment. There are three kinds of Jnana—worldly,  super-worldly, and transcendental. Now, worldly knowledge belongs to the  philosophers and to the ignorant and simple-minded who are attached to  the dualistic views of being and non-being. Super-worldly knowledge  belongs to all the Sravakas and Pratyekabuddhas who are attached to the  notions of individuality and generality. Transcendental knowledge which  is free from the dualism of being and non-being, belongs to the  Bodhisattvas and takes its rise when they thoroughly examine things of  imagelessness, see into the state of no-birth and no-annihilation, and  realise egolessness at the stage of Tathagatahood._3_ 
 
_1_ According to the Chinese versions. 
 
_2_ The use of <em>vijnana</em> in this sense is unusual in  the <em>Lanka;</em> while <em>jnana, aryajnana, prajna,</em> and <em>buddhi</em> are frequently used as synonyms. 
 
_3_ The passage between "Now, worldly knowledge" and  "Tathagatahood" which is restored here according to T'ang and Sung, is  found in the Sanskrit text inserted after the next paragraph, p. 157,  11. 8-13. 
 
(<a name="157"><strong>157</strong></a>) Vijnana is subject to birth and  destruction, and Jnana is not subject to birth and destruction. Further,  Mahamati, Vijnana falls into [the dualism of] form and no-form, being  and non-being, and is characterised with multiplicity; but Jnana is  marked with the transcendence of [the dualism of] form and no-form.  Further, Mahamati, Vijnana is characterised with accumulation and Jnana  with non-accumulation. Jnana is of three kinds: that which assertains  individuality and generality, that which assertains birth and decay, and  that which assertains no-birth and no-decay. 
 
Further, Mahamati, Jnana is devoid of attachment; Vijnana attaches  itself to the multitudinousness of objects. Again, Vijnana is produced  from the concordance of the triple combination;_1_ Jnana, in  its self-nature, has nothing to do with combination or concordance.  Again, Mahamati,_2_ Jnana is characterised with  unattainability; it is the inner state of self-realisation by noble  wisdom, (<a name="158"><strong>158</strong></a>) and as it neither enters nor goes  out, it is like the moon in water. So it is said: 
 
38. Karma is accumulated by Citta, and discriminated by Jnana; and  one acquires by Prajna the state of imagelessness and the powers. 
 
39. Citta is bound up with an objective world, Jnana evolves with  reflection; and Prajna evolves in the exalted state of imagelessness and  in the excellent conditions. 
 
40. Citta, Manas, and Vijnana are devoid of thoughts and  discriminations;_3_ it is the Sravakas and not the Bodhisattvas  that try to reach reality by means of discrimination. 
 
_1_ Read <em>trisamgatyutpadayogalaksanam</em> (lines 15-10),  and <em>asamgatiyogasva�</em> (line 16), according to Sung and T'ang. 
 
_2_ T'ang and Sung have inserted here: Vijnana is  characterised with attainability. 
 
_3_ Is this in accord with the general drift of thought  maintained in the text? T'ang and Sung have: Citta, Manas, and Vijnana,  when devoid of thought and discrimination, attain the state of  non-discrimination; this belongs to the Bodhisattvas and not to the  Sravakas. 
 
41. The Tathagata's Jnana is pure, [resting] in quietude in the most  excellent patience [or recognition of truth]; it is productive of  excellent sense and is devoid of purposive-ness (<em>samudacara-varijitam</em>). 
 
42. Prajna, with me, is of three kinds; whereby the wise grow  powerful, individual signs are discriminated, and all things are  manifested._1_ 
 
43. My Prajna has nothing to do with the two vehicles, it excludes  the world of beings; that of the Sravakas evolves from their attachment  to the world of beings; the Tathagata's Prajna is spotless_2_ because of its being in accord with Mind-only.

Further, Mahamati, there are nine kinds of transformation as held by  the philosophers endorsing the doctrine of transformation. They are: (1)  the transformation of form; (<a name="159"><strong>159</strong></a>) (2) the  transformation of characteristics; (3) the transformation of cause; (4)  the transformation of concordance; (5) the transformation of view; (6)  the transformation of origin; (7) the transformation of nature; (8) the  transformation of manifest conditions; and (9) the transformation of  manifest work. These, Mahamati, are the nine views of transformation  expounded by all the philosophers in accordance with their secret  teaching, and they are all founded upon the dualism of being and  non-being. 
 
Now, Mahamati, by the transformation of form is meant the alteration  of form in appearance as gold takes various shapes when made into all  kinds of ornament. For example: gold is seen made into a bracelet, a  necklace, a fylfot, or what not; though the gold itself remains the  same, varieties of articles [made of it] are all different in form, that  is, in their transformations. In the same way, Mahamati, there is a  general transformation of things which is discriminated by other  philosophers as coming from a causal agency. They are not right, nor are  they otherwise. All differentiation in transformation is to be regarded  as due to discrimination, such as the thickening of milk into curds and  the ripening of fruit into a liquor. Mahamati, like this thickening and  ripening each transformation is a transformation rising from  discrimination, which is discriminated by the philosophers; really there  is nothing transformed, for the external objects of which being and  non-being are discriminated, are what is seen of Mind itself and have no  reality of their own. In the same way, Mahamati, what is regarded by  the ignorant and simple-minded as the evolving of objects is no more  than the discrimination of their own mind, and, (<a name="160"><strong>160</strong></a>)  Mahamati, there is really nothing evolving, nothing disappearing, as it  is like seeing things that evolve in a vision and a dream. Mahamati, it  is like perceiving the rise and disappearance of things in a dream; it  is like the birth and death of a barren woman's child. So it is said: 
 
44. The transformation of the form in time, and the embracing [of the  soul] in the elements and sense-organs, which is in its middle-way  existence (<em>antarabhava</em>)—they who [thus] imagine [the birth of a  child] are not wise men. 
 
45. The Buddhas do not discriminate the world as subject to the chain  of origination; but they regard the causation which rules this world as  something like the city of the Gandharvas.

At that time, Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva asked the Blessed  One to explain concerning the deep-seated attachment to the existence of  all things and the way of emancipation, saying: Pray tell me, Blessed  One, pray tell me Tathagata, Arhat, Fully-Enlightened One, concerning  the characteristics of our deep attachment to existence and of our  detachment from it. When I and other Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas understand  well the distinction between attachment and detachment, we shall know  what is the skilful means concerning them, and shall no more become  attached to words according to which we grasp meaning. When we  understand well what is meant by attachment to the existence of all  things and the detachment from them, we shall destroy our discrimination  of words and letters; and, by means of our wisdom (<em>buddhi</em>),  enter into all the Buddha-lands and assemblies; be well stamped with the  stamp of the powers, the self-control, the psychic faculties, and the  Dharanis; and, well furnished with the wisdom (<em>buddhi</em>) in the ten  inexhaustible vows and shining with varieties of rays pertaining to the  Transformation Body, (<a name="161"><strong>161</strong></a>) behave ourselves  with effortlessness like the moon, the sun, the jewel, and the elements;  and hold such views at every stage as are free from all the signs of  self-discrimination; and, seeing that all things are like a dream, like  Maya, etc., [shall be able to] enter the stage and abode of Buddhahood,  and deliver discourses on the Dharma in the world of all beings and ill  accordance with their needs, and free them from the dualistic notion of  being and non-being in the contemplation of all things which are like a  dream and Maya, and free them also from the false discrimination of  birth and destruction; and. finally, [shall be able to] establish  ourselves where there is a revulsion at the deepest recesses [of our  consciousness], which is more than words [can express]. 
 
Said the Blessed One: Well said, well said, Mahamati! Listen well to  me then, Mahamati, and reflect well within yourself; I will tell you. 
 
Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said, Certainly, I will, Blessed  One; and gave ear to the Blessed One. 
 
The Blessed One said to him thus: Mahamati, immeasurable is our  deep-seated attachment to the existence of all things the significance  of which we try to understand after words. For instance, there are the  deep-seated attachments to signs of individuality, to causation, to the  notion of being and non-being, to the discrimination of birth and  no-birth, to the discrimination of cessation and no-cessation, to the  discrimination of vehicle and no-vehicle, of Samskrita and Asamskrita,  of the characteristics of the stages and no-stages, and the attachment  to discrimination itself, and to that arising from enlightenment, the  attachment to the discrimination of being and non-being on which the  philosophers are so dependent, and the attachment to the triple vehicle  and the one vehicle, which are discriminated. 
 
These and others, Mahamati, are the deep-seated attachments cherished  by the ignorant and simple-minded (<a name="162"><strong>162</strong></a>) to  their discriminations. Tenaciously attaching themselves to these the  ignorant and simple-minded go on ever discriminating like the silk-worms  who, with their own thread of discrimination and attachment, enwrap not  only themselves but others and are charmed with the thread; and thus  they are ever tenaciously attached to the notions of existence and  non-existence. [But really] Mahamati, there are no signs here of  deep-seated attachment or detachment. All things are to be seen as  abiding in solitude where there is no evolving of discrimination.  Mahamati, the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva should have his abode where he can  see all things from the viewpoint of solitude. 
 
Further, Mahamati, when the existence and non-existence of the  external world are understood to be due to the seeing of the Mind itself  in these signs, [the Bodhisattva] can enter upon the state of  imagelessness where Mind-only is, and [there] see into the solitude  which characterises the discrimination of all things as being and  non-being and the deep-seated attachments resulting therefrom. This  being so, there are in all things no signs of a deep-rooted attachment  or of detachment. Here, Mahamati, is nobody in bondage, nobody in  emancipation, except those who by reason of their perverted wisdom_1_ recognise bondage and emancipation. Why? Because in all things neither  being nor non-being is to be taken hold of. 
 
Further, Mahamati, there are three attachments deep-seated in the  minds of the ignorant and simple-minded. They are greed, anger, and  folly; and thus there is desire which is procreative and is accompanied  by joy and greed; closely attached to this there takes place a  succession of births in the [five] paths. Thus there are the five paths  of existence for all beings who are found closely attached [to greed,  anger, and folly]. When one is cut off from this attachment, (<a name="163"><strong>163</strong></a>) no signs will be seen indicative of  attachment or of non-attachment. 
 
_1_ Read <em>buddhya,</em> instead of <em>budhya</em>. 
 
Further, Mahamati, depending upon and attaching to the triple  combination which works in unison, there is the continuation of the  Vijnanas incessantly functioning; and because of the attachment there is  a continued and deep-felt assertion of existence. When the triple  combination which causes the functioning of the Vijnanas no more takes  place, there is the triple emancipation, and when this is kept in view,  there is no rising of any combination. So it is said: 
 
46. The imagining of things not existent—this is characteristic of  attachment [deeply seated in all beings]; when the truth of this is  thoroughly understood, the net of attachment is cleared away. 
 
47. The ignorant take hold of the knowledge of existence according to  words and are bound up like the silk-worm with their own  discriminations; hence their ignorance of attachment [deeply seated in  their minds].

Further, Mahamati said: According to the Blessed One, in all things  that are variously discriminated by discrimination there is no  self-nature, as it is nothing but [the creation of] false imagination (<em>parikalpita</em>);  if, Blessed One, it is but [the creation of] false imagination and  there is nothing in the world which is to be conceived as indicative of  self-nature, does it not, Blessed One, come to this, according to your  statement, that there is neither defilement nor purification, because  all things are of the nature of false imagination? 
 
Said the Blessed One: Mahamati, it is just as you say. The  self-nature of things is the discrimination of the ignorant and  simple-minded, and it is not as it- is discriminated by them. (<a name="164"><strong>164</strong></a>) Mahamati, it is the creation of false  imagination; nothing indicative of self-nature is to be ascertained.  But, Mahamati, there is the self-nature of things such as is ascertained  by the wise, by their wise knowledge, by their wise insight, by their  wise transcendental vision. 
 
Said Mahamati: Blessed One, if there is the self-nature of things  such as is ascertained by the wise, by their wise knowledge, by their  wise insight, by their wise transcendental vision which is neither human  nor celestial vision, and if there is no such self-nature as is  discriminated by the ignorant and simple-minded, how, Blessed One, can  the ignorant and the simple-minded abandon their discriminations, as  they have no way to recognise the presence of an exalted reality (<em>aryabhavavastu</em>)?  For they are neither perverted nor unperverted, Blessed One. [that is,  they are what they are]. Why? Because they are unable to have an insight  into the self-nature of exalted reality, because they see the course of  things in the aspect of being and non-being. And Blessed One, the  reality_1_ cannot be such as is discriminated even by the wise,  because the aspect of reality as it is in itself cannot be an object  [of discrimination by anybody]; because, Blessed One, what appears to  the wise as the self-nature of reality is no more than the creation of  their imagination, which is predicable with the notion of causation and  no-causation; that is, they also cherish in their own way the idea of a  being with self-nature. [And they would say] that this is a realm that  belongs to somebody else and is not that [of the ignorant]. This is  committing the fault of non-finality, for thus what constitutes the  self-nature of reality becomes impossible to know. Blessed One, what is  derived from the imagination cannot be the self-nature of reality. How  is it (<a name="165"><strong>165</strong></a>) that while things are said to exist  owing to the imagination_2_ [or discrimination], they are said  again not to be such as are imagined? 
 
_1_ <em>Vastu</em> and <em>bhava</em> are both used here in the  sense of reality. 
 
_2_ Throughout this text, <em>parikalpa, vikalpa, pratikalpa,</em> and <em>prativikalpa</em> are used interchangeably 
 
Blessed One, [it is true that] according to the way the imagination  is carried on, the self-nature of reality conceived may vary; for when  the cause is not alike, the notion of reality that thus comes to be  cherished may not be alike. But according to you, Blessed One, while the  imagination is kept on going with the wise as well as with the  ignorant, the latter alone fail to see reality as it is; and yet you  tell us that the reason why it is said that things are not really such  as are imagined by the imagination is to make all beings discard their  imagination. Now, Blessed One, is it that in order to have all beings  free from the notion of being [which is realism] and of non-being [which  is nihilism], you in turn make them cherish a realistic view of  existence_1_ by telling them to uphold the idea of the  self-nature of reality, whereby they are led to cling to the realm of  noble wisdom? Why do you deny the truth of solitude by teaching the  doctrine of reality whose self-nature is [according to you] noble  wisdom?_2_ 
 
Said the Blessed One: Mahamati, it is not true that I deny truth of  solitude, nor that I fall into a realistic view by upholding the noble  doctrine of self-existing reality. But in order to save all beings from  becoming frightened, who are addicted from beginningless past to the  notion of self-nature, it is told them that there is truth of solitude,  after making them realise by means of noble wisdom that reality in its  self-nature is made the subject of attachment [by the ignorant].  Mahamati, the doctrine of self-nature is not taught by me. But,  Mahamati, those who have realised by themselves truth of solitude as it  really is and are abiding in it, will see that [this existence of] error  has no form; and thereby knowing that what is seen is nothing but the  Mind itself, (<a name="166"><strong>166</strong></a>) they are kept away from  [dualistically] viewing an external world_3_ under the aspect  of being and non-being; they are stamped well with the stamp of suchness  which is gained by the triple emancipation; they will have an intuition  into the self-nature of all things by the wisdom which is acquired  within themselves, and thus get away from such ideas of reality as to  lead themselves to realism and nihilism.

Further, Mahamati, the thesis: "All things are unborn" is not to be  maintained by the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva as valid. Why? Of this thesis  it is to be stated that anything of which something is asserted partakes  thereby of the nature of being, and that the reason for this thesis is  characterised with the quality of birth; while it is being asserted by  the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva that all things are unborn, the very  assertion destroys his thesis. The thesis that all things are unborn  acts against the one who holds it because it is born of the principle of  mutuality. Even when this thesis of no-birth is to be maintained within  the extent of existence itself, the notion of no-birth cannot hold  itself in it, and the statement, the thesis, that all things are unborn  is destroyed since it is dependent on the members of the syllogism. As  regards the thesis maintaining the no-birth_1_ of being and  non-being, Mahamati, this thesis, to be valid, must be within the limits  of existence itself; but there is no aspect of existence which can be  regarded either as being or as non-being. If, Mahamati, the no-birth of  all things is to be asserted by this thesis of no-birth, (<a name="167"><strong>167</strong></a>)  the very attempt defeats the thesis itself._2_ Therefore, this  thesis is not to be upheld. Because many faults come out in connection  with the members of the syllogism, and because in these syllogistic  members there is a mutual mixing-up of reasons, this thesis is not to be  upheld. 
 
_1_ Literally, "is not born." 
 
_2_ <em>Pratijnayam......pratijna bhavati</em> (lines 1-4) is  omitted in the translation following T'ang and Sung, as it does not add  to the clearing up of the meaning. 
 
As with [the thesis that] all things are unborn, so with [the thesis  that] all things are empty and have no self-nature—neither is to be  maintained by the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva. But, Mahamati, this is to be  pointed out by the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva, that things in their  self-nature are like Maya, like a dream; for they are in one way  perceived [as existing] and in another way are not perceived [as such],  and all things are thus seen in [two] ways, in accordance either with  knowledge or ignorance. Let it be pointed out that all things are like  Maya and a dream, except when the feeling of fear is aroused in the  minds of the ignorant. Mahamati, the ignorant and the simple-minded are  addicted to the views of being and non-being, and are liable to tremble  [at our teaching]; Mahamati, let them not be frightened away from the  Mahayana. So it is said: 
 
48. There is no self-nature, no thought-construction, no reality, no  Alaya-vijnana; these, indeed, are so many discriminations cherished by  the ignorant who like a corpse are bad logicians. 
 
(<a name="168"><strong>168</strong></a>) 49. All things are unborn—[this  thesis] is established by all the philosophers; [but] nothing whatever  is ever born, [no establishment is needed,] things are all linked by  causation. 
 
50. All things are unborn—no such discrimination is made by  transcendental knowledge; when a certain conclusion is made depending on  a cause, there is no sound judgment in it. 
 
51. As a hair-net is what is wrongly perceived by those who are  dim-eyed, so existence discriminated [as real] is due to the wrong  discrimination of the ignorant. 
 
52. The triple world is no more than thought-construction (<em>prajnapti</em>),  there is no reality in its self-nature; by means of this  thought-constructed reality, logicians go on discriminating. 
 
53. Individual form, reality, thought-construction, — these are  [only] a mental disturbance; transcending all this, my sons will walk  where there is no discrimination. 
 
54. As in a mirage in the air, the thought of water is cherished  where there is no water, so things are seen by the ignorant otherwise  than by the wise. 
 
55. The insight of the wise, who move about in the realm of  imagelessness, is pure, is born of the triple emancipation, is released  from birth and destruction. 
 
56. Where all things are wiped away, even a state of imagelessness  ceases to exist for the Yogins; in the sameness of existence and  non-existence, the fruit [of wisdom] is born to the wise. 
 
(<a name="169"><strong>169</strong></a>) 57. How does existence cease to exist?  How does the sameness take place? When the mind fails to understand  [the truth], there is disturbance inside, outside, and in the middle;  with the cessation [of the disturbance] the mind sees the sameness.

Further, Mahamati said: It is told by the Blessed One, again, that  [true] knowledge is gained independent of any object supporting it, and  whatever statements one makes about it are no more than  thought-construction, and that as this thought-construction is not to be  seized as real, the seizing act of the seizer itself ceases, and when  there is thus no seizing, knowledge which is known as discrimination no  more evolves. Now, Blessed One, [how is transcendental knowledge  unobtainable?] Is it unobtainable because of our not recognising the  generality and individuality of things, their pluralities, their  unities? Or is it unobtainable because [such ideas as] individuality,  generality, multiplicity, and self-nature overpower one another? Or is  it unobtainable because of the obstructions presented by a wall, a  mountain, an earth-work, a rampart, or by earth, wind, water, or fire?  Or because of remoteness or nearness? Or does the knowledge fail to  obtain its object of cognition because of [the imperfection of] the  sense-organs due to youth, age, or blindness? If, Blessed One, knowledge  was not obtainable because of our not recognising individuality,  generality, unity and plurality, then, Blessed One, such cannot be  [transcendental] knowledge; it is to be called ignorance (<em>ajnana</em>),  for in spite of the fact that objects to be known are before us we do  not know them. Again, if knowledge is unobtainable because [such ideas  as] individuality, generality, multiplicity, and self-nature overpower  one another, such is ignorance (<em>ajnana</em>). (<a name="170"><strong>170</strong></a>)  Blessed One, it is not [transcendental] knowledge. Where there is  something to be known, Blessed One, knowledge evolves; where there is  nothing, none evolves; knowledge is possible [only] where there is a  correspondence with that which is known. Again, if knowledge is  unobtainable because of the obstruction presented by a wall, mountain,  earthwork, rampart, or by earth, water, wind, or fire, or due to farness  or nearness, or on account of the imperfection of the sense-organs as  in the case of an infant, the aged, and the blind, such as is  unattainable is not [transcendental] knowledge; it is ignorance, for the  object to be known is there but the knowing faculty is lacking. 
 
Said the Blessed One: Mahamati, such [knowledge as is unobtainable]  is not ignorance, such is [transcendental] knowledge; Mahamati, it is  not ignorance. It is not because of the deeper sense that I say this,  but when [we know that] there is knowledge gained independent of any  supporting object, whatever statements we make about it are no more than  thought-constructions. That [transcendental] knowledge is unobtainable  is due to the recognition that there is nothing in the world but what is  seen of the Mind, and that these external objects to which being and  non-being are predicated are non-existent. As this [knowledge] is  unobtainable, there is no evolving of knowing and known, and as thus the  triple emancipation is realised, there is unattainable knowledge [which  is transcendental]. But logicians being under the habit-energy of the  wrong reasoning which has been carried on since beginningless time as to  existence and non-existence are unable to know all this, and, while not  knowing it, they are concerned with [such notions as] external objects,  substances, forms, indications, existence and non-existence; and yet  they declare that the cessation of discrimination is [the state of] the  Mind-only. As they are tenaciously clinging to the thought of an  ego-soul and all that belongs to it, they are really unable to  understand what is meant by the doctrine of Mind-only, (<a name="171"><strong>171</strong></a>)  and go on discriminating knowing and known. And because of their  discriminating knowing and known, they think of things as existent and  non-existent, and declaring that [transcendental knowledge] is  unobtainable, abide in nihilism. So it is said: 
 
58. If [transcendental] knowledge fails to see an objective world  which lies before it, such is ignorance and not knowledge; this teaching  belongs to the logicians. 
 
59. If [transcendental] knowledge fails to see, though various  obstructions far and near, its own unique object that does not present  itself [as an object], such is to be called wrong knowledge. 
 
60. If [transcendental] knowledge fails to know, on account of  defective senses such as infancy, old age, and blindness, its own object  which is present, such is to be called wrong knowledge.

Further, Mahamati, the ignorant and simple-minded keep on dancing and  leaping fascinated with their wrong reasonings, falsehoods, and  self-discriminations, and are unable to understand the truth of  self-realisation and its discourse in words; clinging to the external  world which is seen of the Mind itself, they cling to the study of the  discourses which are a means and do not know properly how to assertain  the truth of self-realisation which is the truth unspoiled by the  fourfold proposition. 
 
Said Mahamati: Blessed One, it is just as you say. Pray tell me,  Blessed One, about the characteristic features of the truth of  self-realisation and about the discourses on it, whereby I and other  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas in future time, understanding what they are, may  keep ourselves away from the wrong logicians such as the philosophers  and those who belong to the vehicles of the Sravaka and the  Pratyekabuddha. 
 
(<a name="172"><strong>172</strong></a>) Said the Blessed One: Then, Mahamati,  listen well and reflect well within yourself; I will tell you. 
 
Certainly, Blessed One; said Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva and  gave ear to the Blessed One. 
 
The Blessed One said this to him: Mahamati, there are two forms of  teaching the truth attained by the Tathagatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened  Ones of the past, present, and future. They are: the teaching by  discourses, and the teaching by the establishment of self-realisation.  What is meant 
 
by the studying of the discourses is this, Mahamati: there are  various materials and canonical texts and discourses by which sentient  beings are taught according to their dispositions and inclinations. What  then is the truth of self-realisation by which the Yogins turn away  from discriminating what is seen of the Mind itself? There is an exalted  state of inner attainment which does not fall into the dualism of  oneness and otherness, of bothness and not-bothness; which goes beyond  the Citta, Manas, and Manovijnana; which has nothing to do with logic,  reasoning, theorising, and illustrating; which has never been tasted by  any bad logicians, by the philosophers, Sravakas, and Pratyekabuddhas,  who have fallen into the dualistic views of being and non-being— this I  call self-realisation. This, Mahamati, is what characterises the truth  of self-realisation and discoursing on it, and in this you and the other  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas are to discipline themselves. So it is said: 
 
61. I have two forms of teaching the truth: self-realisation and  discoursing. I discourse with the ignorant and [disclose]  self-realisation to the Yogins. 
 
<a name="LXXIII">

</a> 
 
(<a name="173"><strong>173</strong></a>) At that time again, Mahamati the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said this to the Blessed One: It was told at one  time by the Blessed One, the Tathagata, the Arhat, the Fully-Enlightened  One, that the Lokayatika who is [skilled in] various forms of  incantation and in the art of eloquence is not to be honoured, adored,  and reverently attended upon; for what one gains from such devotions is  worldly enjoyments and not the Dharma [or Truth]. For what reason is  this said, Blessed One, that by devoting ourselves to the Lokayatika who  is skilled in varieties of incantations and in the art of eloquence,  worldly enjoyments are gained but not the Dharma [or Truth]? 
 
Said the Blessed One: The Lokayatika who is skilled in varieties of  incantations and in the art of eloquence, Mahamati, puts the minds of  the ignorant in utter confusion by means of various reasonings, by  [clever manipulation of] words and phrases, and what he teaches being  the mere prattle of a child as far as one can make out is not at all in  accordance with truth nor in unison with sense. For this reason,  Mahamati, the Lokayatika is said to be skilled in varieties of  incantations and in the art of eloquence. He attracts the ignorant by  making clever use of various words, [but] he never leads them to the way  of truth and right teaching. As he himself does not understand what all  things mean, he puts the minds of the ignorant into utter confusion by  his dualistic views, thus ruining himself. Not being released of the  transition from one path to another, not understanding that there is  nothing but what is seen of the Mind itself, and attaching himself to  the idea of self-nature in external things, the Lokayatika knows no  deliverance from discrimination. For this reason, Mahamati, the  Lokayatika who is clever in various incantations (<a name="174"><strong>174</strong></a>)  and in the art of eloquence, being thus never emancipated from such  calamities_1_ as birth, age, disease, sorrow, lamentation,  pain, and despair, leads the ignorant into bewilderment by means of  various words, phrases, reasons, examples, and conclusions.

Mahamati, Indra was a brilliant [Lokayatika] whose knowledge made him  master of many treatises and who was himself the author of a work on  sound. He had a disciple who assuming the body of a serpent went up to  heaven and got into the society of the god Indra. Making up a thesis he  challenged the god: Either your one-thousand-spoked chariot be smashed  to pieces, or every one of my own serpent-hoods be cut off. In the  argument the Lokayatika disciple who had assumed the form of a serpent  defeated [the god-opponent], whereupon the one-thousand-spoked chariot  was smashed to pieces. The disciple then came down again to this world.  In such a way, Mahamati, [the Lokayatika] has a system composed of  various reasonings and exemplifications, and, knowing well even the  minds of the animal world, puts the gods and fighting demons in utter  confusion by means of various words and phrases; he then makes them  tenaciously adhere to the notion of coming and going (<em>ayavyaya</em>);  how much more human beings! For this reason, Mahamati, the Lokayatika is  to be shunned, for he carries with him the cause leading to the birth  of pain. No homage, no reverence, no service is to be shown him.  Mahamati, the attainment of the Lokayatika does not go beyond the realm  of the body and knowledge belonging to it, though he may explain his  materialism by using varieties of words and phrases (<a name="175"><strong>175</strong></a>)  amounting to a hundred thousand. But in after times, after five hundred  years, divisions will take place [among his followers] leading them to  wrong reasonings and demonstrations; divisions will abound because of  this, not being able to hold disciples. Thus, Mahamati, materialism  splitting into many parties and adhering to varieties of reasonings is  explained by the philosophers, each of whom clings to his way of  reasoning as he knows no truth existing by itself. While this is not at  all the case with [all] the philosophers who have their own treatises  and doctrines, materialism is asserted under various disguises which are  explained by a hundred thousand different methods; there is in them  [also] no truth existing by itself, and they do not recognise that  theirs is materialism because of their stupidity._1_ 
 
<div>_1_ Read <em>mohat</em> instead of <em>mohohat</em>.</div> 
 
Said Mahamati: If all the philosophers teach materialism by means of  various words, phrases, examples, and conclusions, which are not the  truth as it is, but are their own selfish assertions tenaciously  maintained, does not the Blessed One too teach materialism by means of  various words and phrases, to the assemblages of the gods, demons, and  human beings, who come from various countries—I say, materialism which  is not the truth of self-realisation but is something like the  discourses of all the philosophers? 
 
The Blessed One said: I do not teach materialism, nor  coming-and-going (<em>ayavyaya</em>). But I teach, Mahamati, that which is  not coming-and-going. Now, Mahamati, coming means production and mass,  it is born of accumulation. Going, Mahamati, means destruction. That  which is not coming-and-going is designated unborn. (<a name="176"><strong>176</strong></a>)  Mahamati, I do not teach anything approaching the discrimination of the  philosophers. For what reason? Because there are no external objects,  there is nothing to get attached to; when one abides in Mind-only,  beyond which there is no external world, dualism ceases; as there is no  realm of form based on discrimination, one comes to recognise that there  is nothing but what is seen of the Mind itself; and for these reasons  the discrimination of what is seen of the Mind itself does not take  place. Owing to the cessation of discrimination, one enters into the  triple emancipation where is the state of no-form, emptiness, and  effortlessness. Hence it is called deliverance. 
 
I remember, Mahamati, when I was staying in a certain place, a  Brahman Lokayatika approached where I was and having approached suddenly  asked me, saying: Gautama, is all created? 
 
I said this to him: Brahman, if all is created, this is the first  school of materialism. 
 
Guatama, is all uncreated? 
 
Brahman, if all is uncreated, this is the second school of  materialism. Thus [to state that] all is non-eternal, or that all is  eternal, or that all is born, or that all is unborn, this, Brahman, is  the sixth school of materialism. 
 
Again, Mahamati, the Brahman Lokayatika said this to me: Gautama, is  all one? Is all different? Is all characterised with bothness? Is all  characterised with not-bothness? Is all to be regarded as subject to  causation since all is seen as born of varieties of causes? 
 
This, Brahman, is the tenth school of materialism. 
 
Again, Gautama, is all explainable? Is all unexplainable? Is there an  ego-soul? Is there no ego-soul? Is this world real? (<a name="177"><strong>177</strong></a>)  Is this world not-real? Is there another world? Is there no other  world? Is another world existent or non-existent?_1_ Is there  emancipation? Is there no emancipation? Is all momentary? Is all not  momentary? Are space, Apratisamkhya-nirodha,_2_ and Nirvana, O  Gautama, are they created or uncreated? Is there the middle existence?  Is there no middle existence? 
 
_1_ The Chinese translations omit this question. 
 
_2_ "Annihilation taking place without premeditation"—one of  the three non-effect-producing objects (<em>asamskrita</em>). 
 
I then said this to him, Mahamati: If so, Brahman, this is  materialism. It is not mine. O Brahman, it is your worldly philosophy. I  explain, Brahman, that the triple world has its cause in the  habit-energy of discrimination going on since beginningless time on  account of error and wrong reasoning: for discrimination takes place.  Brahman, because it is not recognised that there is no external world  but the Mind itself, and not because an external world is seen as the  object of cognition. According to the philosophers, there is a triple  concordance of an ego-soul, sense-organs, and an objective world, but  such is not mine. Brahman, I do not belong to the school of causation,  nor to the school of no-causation, except that I teach the chain of  origination as far as the thought-constructed world of grasped and  grasping exists depending on discrimination. This is not understood by  you and others who cherish the notion of an ego-soul and its continuity.  Mahamati, space, Nirvana, and causation exist in enumeration; as  realities they are unobtainable. Hence the question whether they are  created or not requires no answering. 
 
Again, Mahamati, the Brahman Lokayatika said this: Is the triple  world to be regarded as caused by ignorance, desire, and action? or is  it causeless? 
 
Brahman, this twofold question again belongs to materialism. 
 
Gautama, are all things to be conceived (<a name="178"><strong>178</strong></a>)  under the aspect of individuality and generality? 
 
This, too, Brahman, belongs to materialism. So long as there is a  mental perturbation which makes one cling to an objective world of  discrimination, there is materialism. 
 
Further, Mahamati, this Brahman materialist said this to me: Gautama,  is there any philosophy that is not of the world? All the truth that is  taught by all the philosophers by means of varieties of words and  phrases, by means of reasons, examples, and conclusions, by general  consent, Gautama, belongs to me. 
 
Brahman, there is something that does not belong to you, though it is  not beyond the truth of general consent, nor independent of varieties  of words and phrases, and further, it is not out of accord with reason. 
 
[The Brahman asked,] Is there any philosophy that is not of the world  and yet belongs to the general opinion of the world? 
 
Brahman, there is that which does not belong to materialism and which  is not reached by your wisdom nor by that of the philosophers who cling  to false discriminations and wrong reasonings as they fail to see the  unreality of external objects. By this is meant the cessation of  discrimination. When it is recognised that there is nothing beyond what  is seen of the Mind itself, the discrimination of being and non-being  ceases; as thus there is no external world as the object of perception,  discrimination abides in its own abode._1_ This is not of  materialism; it belongs to me, it does not belong to you. By abiding in  its own abode is meant that it ceases to evolve; as discrimination is no  more born, it is said to have ceased to evolve. This, Brahman, is not  of materialism. In short, Brahman, if there is any coming-and-going of  the Vijnanas, (<a name="179"><strong>179</strong></a>) a vanishing-and-appearing, a  solicitation, an attachment, an intense affection, a philosophical  view, a theory, an abode, a touch, the clinging to various signs,  assemblage, continuity,_2_ desire (<em>trishna</em>), and  attachment to a cause, this, Brahman, is materialism of yours but not  mine. 
 
_1_ A better reading of the Nanjo text may be to follow the  T'ang and the Wei, according to which <em>vikalpah</em> (1. 16) is negated  and <em>svasthane 'vatishthate</em> forms a separate sentence, thus:  "Discrimination ceases, and one abides in the self-abode." That by this  self-abode is meant the self-abode of reality is gathered from such  phrases as <em>yathabhutarthasthana-darsanam</em> (p. 200, 1. 6), <em>yathabhutavasthanadarsanam</em> (p. 112, 1. 6), <em>yathabhutasvalakshanavasthanavasthitam</em> (p. 124,  1. 1), <em>vikalpasyapravritteh svastho, loko nishkriyah</em> (p. 199, 1.  3), etc. The self-abode of reality is where reality is seen as it is in  itself, or as the suchness of existence, or as something solitary (<em>viviktadharma</em>),  i. e. absolute. 
 
_2_ <em>Samtatih</em> instead of <em>sattvanam,</em> according  to T'ang and Sung. 
 
Mahamati, I was thus questioned by the Brahman materialist, who came  to me, and when he was thus sent off he silently departed. 
 
At that time there came to the Blessed One the King of the Nagas,  called Krishnapakshaka, who assumed the body of a Brahman and said thus:  Gautama, is there not another world? 
 
Now, young man, whence do you come? 
 
Gautama, I am come from White Isle. 
 
Brahman, that is another world. 
 
The young man thus refuted and put to silence made himself invisible  without asking me anything about my own teaching, which stands in  opposition to his;_1_ he thought within himself: This son of  the Sakyas stands outside of my own system; he is a pitiable fellow, he  belongs to the school which holds the cessation of signs and causes, he  talks of the cessation of discrimination which will take place when  there is the cognition of an external world as something seen of one's  own discrimination. And, Mahamati, you too ask me how, for one who  serves the Lokayatika skilled in various incantations and in the art of  eloquence, there are worldly enjoyments and not the attainment of the  Dharma. 
 
Said Mahamati; What is meant, Blessed One, by the words, "the objects  of worldly enjoyment" and "the Dharma"? 
 
(<a name="180"><strong>180</strong></a>) Said the Blessed One: Well said, well  said, Mahamati! You have thought deeply about this twofold meaning,  having in view present and future generations. Then, Mahamati, listen  well and reflect well within yourself; I will tell you. 
 
Certainly, Blessed One; said Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva and  gave ear to the Blessed One. 
 
_1_ There is no allusion in the Chinese versions to this  dialogue between Krishnapakshaka and the Buddha. 
 
The Blessed One said this to him: What is meant by a worldly object  of enjoyment, Mahamati? It means that which can be touched, attracted  by, wiped off, handled, and tasted; it is that which makes one get  attached to an external world, enter into a dualism on account of a  wrong view, and appear again in the Skandhas, where, owing to the  procreative force of desire, there arise all kinds of disaster such as  birth, age, disease, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, despair, etc.  This is called the object of worldly enjoyment by myself and other  Buddhas. This, Mahamati, is the attainment of worldly enjoyments and not  that of the Truth. It is materialism which one learns by serving the  Lokayatika. 
 
Mahamati, what is meant by the attainment of the Dharma (Truth)? When  the truth of Self-mind and the twofold egolessness are understood, and  further, when the nature of the egolessness of things and persons is  seen into, discrimination ceases to assert itself; when the various  stages of Bodhisattvahood are thoroughly perceived one after another,  the Citta, Manas, and Manovijnana are turned away; and when one enters  upon the path of baptism by the wisdom of all the Buddhas, and takes  hold of the [ten] inexhaustible vows,_1_ one becomes (<a name="181"><strong>181</strong></a>) sovereign master of all things by virtue of a  life of effortlessness. Hence it is called the Dharma, as one is  thereby released from all philosophical views, unsound reasonings,  discriminations, and dualistic notions. As a rule, Mahamati, the  philosophical views lead the ignorant, though not the wise, to a  dualism, that is, to nihilism and eternalism. Eternalism rises from  embracing a doctrine of no-causation, while nihilism rises from  believing in the annihilation of causal conditions and in the  non-existence of a cause. I teach, however, the Dharma so called which  is [subject to] the conditions of rising, abiding, and destruction.  This, Mahamati, is the conclusion with regard to worldly enjoyment and  the Dharma. So it is said: 
 
62. Beings are subdued by the reception (<em>samgraha</em>),_2_ and are brought into subjection by the moral precepts (<em>sila</em>);  they are removed from philosophical views by transcendental knowledge (<em>prajna</em>)  and are nourished by the emancipations._3_ 
 
_1_ Read <em>anishthapada,</em> instead of <em>anadishthapada</em>. 
 
_2_ There are four ways of receiving others, <em>catvari  samgrahavustuni</em>: charity, kindly spirit, benevolent deeds, and  impartiality. 
 
_3_ Missing in Sung. 
 
63. All that is taught by the philosophers to no purpose is  materialism; where the realistic view of cause and effect is cherished,  there is no self-realisation. 
 
64. I teach to my group of disciples one self-realisation which has  nothing to do with cause and effect, being free from materialism. 
 
65. There is nothing but that which is seen of the Mind itself, the  duality too is of the Mind; while existence_1_ is [observed as  divided into] the grasped and the grasping, it has nothing to do with  eternalism or nihilism. 
 
(<a name="182"><strong>182</strong></a>) 66. As long as mentation goes on,  there is materialism; when there is no rising of discrimination, the  world is seen as of Mind itself. 
 
67. "Coming" (<em>ayam</em>) means the originating of the objective  world as effect, and "going" (<em>vyayam</em>) is the not-seeing_2_ of the effect; when one thoroughly understands the "coming-and-going,"  discrimination ceases. 
 
68. Eternity and non-eternity, 'the made and not-made, this world and  that world—all these and other [ideas] belong to materialism.

At that time again, Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said this to  the Blessed One: Nirvana, Nirvana is talked of by the Blessed One; what  does this term designate? What is the Nirvana that is discriminated by  all the philosophers? 
 
Said the Blessed One: Then, Mahamati, listen well and reflect well  within yourself; I will tell you. 
 
Certainly, Blessed One; said Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva and  gave ear to the Blessed One. 
 
The Blessed One said this to him: As to such Nirvanas as are  discriminated by the philosophers, there are really none in existence.  Some philosophers conceive Nirvana to be found where a system of  mentation no more operates owing to the cessation of the Skandhas,  Dhatus, and Ayatanas, or to the indifference to the objective world, or  to the recognition that all things are impermanent; (<a name="183"><strong>183</strong></a>)  or where there is no recollection of the past and present, just as when  a lamp is extinguished, or when a seed is burnt, or when a fire goes  out, because then there is the cessation of all the substrate, which is  explained by the philosophers as the non-rising of discrimination. But,  Mahamati, Nirvana does not consist in mere annihilation. 
 
Again, some explain deliverance by going to another quarter and  abode, as when a wind stops blowing, when the discrimination of objects  ceases. Again, some philosophers explain deliverance by the getting-rid  of the [dualistic] view of knower and known. Some conceive deliverance  to be the cessation of discrimination where one sees permanence and  impermanence. 
 
Again, some explain the discrimination of various forms as the bearer  of pain, and yet not understanding that there is nothing but what is  seen of the Mind itself, are alarmed by the notion of form, and seek  their happiness in formlessness._1_ In this they cherish the  notion of Nirvana. 
 
Again some conceive this to be Nirvana: that in consideration of  generality and individuality recognisable in all things inner and outer,  they are never destroyed, maintaining their being throughout the past,  present, and future. Again some conceive that Nirvana is an ego-soul, a  being, a vital force, a nourisher, a supreme spirit, and the  indestructability of all things. 
 
Again, Mahamati, some philosophers owing to their foolishness declare  this to be Nirvana: that there is a primary substance, there is a  supreme soul, and they are seen differently by each, and that they  produce all things from the transformations of the qualities. 
 
_1_ According to the Chinese translations, <em>nimitto</em> (line 10) is to be cancelled. 
 
Some conceive Nirvana to consist in the extinction of merit and  demerit; some in the destruction of the passions by means of knowledge; (<a name="184"><strong>184</strong></a>) some in regarding Isvara as the free creator  of the world. Some think that the world is born of interaction and that  there is no [special] cause other than this cause, and clinging to it  they have no awakening because of stupidity, and they conceive Nirvana  to consist in this non-awakening. 
 
Again, Mahamati, some philosophers conceive Nirvana to be the  attaining of the true path. Some cherish the thought of Nirvana as where  there is the union of qualities and their owner, from which there is  oneness and otherness, bothness and not-bothness. Some imagine that  Nirvana is where they see the self-nature of things existing all by its  own nature, such as the variegated feathers of the peacock, variously  formed precious stones, or the pointedness of a thorn. 
 
Some, Mahamati, conceive Nirvana in the recognition of the  twenty-five Tattvas (truths); some in the king's observance of the  teaching of the six virtues. Some, seeing that time is a creator and  that the rise of the world depends on time, conceive that Nirvana  consists in recognising this fact. Again, Mahamati, some conceive being  to be Nirvana, some non-being, while some conceive that all things and  Nirvana are not to be distinguished one from the other. 
 
All these views of Nirvana severally advanced by the philosophers  with their reasonings are not in accord with logic, nor are they  acceptable to the wise. Mahamati, they all conceive Nirvana  dualistically and in a causal connection. By these discriminations,  Mahamati, all philosophers imagine Nirvana, but there is nothing rising,  nothing disappearing here, -[and there is no room for discrimination.]  Mahamati, each philosopher relying on his own text-book from which he  draws his understanding and intelligence, examines [the subject] and  sins against [the truth], because [the truth] is not such as is imagined  by him; [his reasoning] ends in setting the mind to wandering about and  becoming confused, as Nirvana is not to be found anywhere. 
 
Again, Mahamati, there are others who, roaring with their  all-knowledge as a lion roars, explain Nirvana in the following wise:  that is, Nirvana is where it is recognised that there is nothing but  what is seen of the Mind itself; where there is no attachment to  external objects, existent or nonexistent; where, getting rid of the  four propositions, there is an insight into the abode of reality as it  is; where, recognising the nature of the Self-mind, (<a name="185"><strong>185</strong></a>)  one does not cherish the dualism of discrimination; where grasped and  grasping are no more obtainable; where all logical measures are not  seized upon as it is realised that they never assert themselves; where  the idea of truth is not adhered to but treated with indifference  because of its causing a bewilderment; where, by the attainment of the  exalted Dharma which lies within the inmost recesses of one's being, the  two forms of egolessness are recognised, the two forms of passions  subsided, and the two kinds of hindrance cleared away; where the stages  of Bodhisattvahood are passed one after another until the stage of  Tathagatahood is attained, in which all the Samadhis beginning with the  Mayopama (Maya-like) are realised, and the Citta, Manas, and Manovijnana  are put away:_1_ [here indeed they say Nirvana is to be  found]. 
 
69. Nirvana is severally conceived by the philosophers; (<a name="186"><strong>186</strong></a>) but theirs is no more than imagination, it is  not the way of emancipation. 
 
70. Released of bound and binding and free from all expediencies, the  philosophers imagine they are emancipated, but emancipation is not to  be found there. 
 
71. Divided into many a school are the systems of the philosophers;  there is thus no emancipation in them, because of their imagination  stupidly carried on. 
 
72. Wrongly imbued with the ideas of cause and effect, all the  philosophers are beguiled, and their is thus no emancipation for them  who are of the dualistic school of being and non-being.

73. The ignorant are delighted with discoursing and false reasoning  [but] they are unable to raise any great intelligence towards truth (<em>tattva</em>),  discoursing is a source of suffering in the triple world, while truth  is the extinguisher of suffering. 
 
74. Like an image seen in a mirror, which is not real, the Mind is  seen by the ignorant in a dualistic form in the mirror of habit-energy. 
 
75. When it is not thoroughly understood that there is nothing but  what is seen of the Mind itself, dualistic discriminations take place;  when it is thoroughly understood that there is nothing but what is seen  of the Mind itself, discrimination ceases, 
 
76. Mind is no other than multiplicity, [and yet it is] devoid of  qualified and qualifying; forms are visible but not in the way as seen  discriminated by the ignorant.

At that time Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said this to him:  Tell me, Blessed One, Tathagata, Arhat, Fully-Enlightened One,  concerning the self-nature of Buddhahood, whereby I and other  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas, understanding well what constitutes the  self-nature_1_ of the Tathagata, may have both ourselves and  others awakened [in the truth]. 
 
The Blessed One said: Then, Mahamati, ask me as you desire, according  to which I will answer. 
 
Mahamati replied: Blessed One, is the Tathagata, the Arhat, the  Fully-Enlightened One to be considered unmade or made, an effect or a  cause, predicated or predicating, an expression or that which is  expressed, knowledge or that which is knowable? Is the Blessed One  different from all these expressions, or not? 
 
_1_ <em>Tathagata-svabhavakusala</em>, instead of <em>svakusala</em>. 
 
The Blessed One said: If the Tathagata, Arhat, Fully-Enlightened One  is to be described by those expressions, he is neither made nor unmade,  neither an effect nor a cause. Why? Because the error of dualism would  here be committed. If, Mahamati, the Tathagata is something made, he is  impermanent; if he is impermanent, anything made would be a Tathagata,  which is not desired by myself and other Tathagatas. If he is something  unmade, his self-essence being attainment, all the preparations brought  forward [for the realisation of Tathagatahood] will be useless, (<a name="188"><strong>188</strong></a>) like a hare's horns, or a barren woman's  child, because of their never having been made. That which is neither an  effect nor a cause, Mahamati, is neither a being nor a non-being; and  that which is neither a being nor a non-being is outside the four  propositions. The four propositions, Mahamati, belong to worldly usage.  That which is outside the four propositions is no more than a word, like  a barren woman's child. Mahamati, a barren woman's child is a mere word  and is beyond the four propositions. As it is beyond them, the wise  know it to be not subject to measurement. So is the meaning of all the  terms concerning the Tathagata to be understood by the wise. 
 
It is told by me that all things are egoless; by this is meant,  Mahamati, that they are devoid of selfhood; hence this egolessness. What  I mean is that all things have each its own individuality which does  not belong to another, as in the case of a cow and a horse. For example,  Mahamati, the being of a cow is not of horse-nature, nor is the being  of a horse of cow-nature. This [exemplifies] the case of neither being  nor non-being. Each of them is not without its own individuality, each  is such as it is by its own nature. In the same way, Mahamati, things  are not each without its own individuality, they are such as they are,  and thus the ignorant and simple-minded fail to understand the  signification of egolessness by reason of their discrimination; indeed,  they are not free from discrimination. The same is to be known exactly  about all things being empty, unborn, and without self-nature. 
 
In the same way the Tathagata and the Skandhas are neither  not-different nor different. If he is not different from the Skandhas,  he is impermanent as (<a name="189"><strong>189</strong></a>) the Skandhas are  something made. If they are different, they are two separate entities;  the case is like a cow's horns. As they look alike, they are not  different; as the one is short and the other long, they are different.  [This can be said] of all things. Mahamati, the right horn of a cow is  thus different from her left horn; so is the left from the right; the  one is longer or shorter than the other. The same can be said of  varieties of colours. Thus the Tathagata and the Skandhas are neither  different nor not-different the one from the other. 
 
In the same way, the Tathagata is neither different nor not-different  from emancipation, he can be described in terms of emancipation. If the  Tathagata is different from emancipation, he partakes of the nature of a  material object; if he does he is impermanent. If he is not different,  there will be no distinction in the attainments of the Yogins, and,  Mahamati, a distinction is seen in the Yogins; therefore, [the  Tathagata] is neither different nor not-different [from emancipation]. 
 
In the same way, knowledge is neither different nor not-different  from that which is known. That, Mahamati, which is neither eternal nor  not-eternal, neither effect nor cause, neither effect-producing nor  not-effect-producing, neither knowledge nor that which is knowable,  neither predicated nor predicating, neither the Skandhas nor different  from the Skandhas, neither that which is expressed nor expression, nor  bound-up with oneness and otherness, with bothness and not-bothness,  —this is something removed from all measurement; that which is removed  from all measurement is not expressible in words;_1_ that which  is not expressible_1_ is something unborn; that which is  unborn is not subject to destruction; that which is not subject to  destruction (<a name="190"><strong>190</strong></a>) is like space, and, Mahamati,  space is neither an effect nor a cause. That which is neither an effect  nor a cause is something unconditioned. That which is unconditioned  goes beyond all idle reasonings. That which goes beyond all idle  reasonings, that is the Tathagata. Mahamati, this is the essence of  perfect enlightenment, this is the self-nature of Buddhahood which is  removed from all senses and measurements. So it is said: 
 
79. That which is released from senses and measurements is neither an  effect nor a cause; it has nothing to do with knowledge and that which  is to be known; it is free from predicated and predicating. 
 
80. There is something which is nowhere to be seen by anybody as the  Skandhas, causation, enlightenment; of that which is nowhere to be seen  by anybody, what description can we make? 
 
81. It is not something made nor unmade, it is neither an effect nor a  cause, it is neither the Skandhas nor not-Skandhas, nor is it other  than the combination. 
 
82. There is something that is not to be seen by the discrimination  of its being, nor is it to be known as nonexistent; such is the  self-essence of all things. 
 
83. Accompanied by being, there is non-being; accompanied by  non-being there is being; as thus non-being is not to be known [by  itself], being is not to be discriminated. 
 
84. Those who cling to mere words, not knowing what is meant by an  ego-soul and egolessness, are immersed in dualism; they are corrupted  and lead the ignorant to corruption. 
 
(<a name="191"><strong>191</strong></a>) 85. When they see my religion  liberated from all detriments, they behold properly, they do not defile  the world-leaders.

At that time again, Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said this to  the Blessed One: Tell me, Blessed One; tell me, Sugata. Mention is made  in the canonical books of the Blessed One's being subject neither to  birth nor to destruction, and it is declared by you that this being  subject neither to birth nor to destruction is an epithet of the  Tathagata. Now, Blessed One, by this being subject neither to birth nor  to destruction, is a non-entity meant? And is it another name for the  Tathagata, as is declared by the Blessed One? It is taught by the  Blessed One that all things are subject neither to birth nor to  destruction because they are not to be seen in the dualistic aspect of  being and non-being. If all things are unborn, Blessed One, no one can  take hold of anything because nothing has ever been born; and if that is  another name of something, what can this something be, Blessed One? 
 
The Blessed One said: Then, Mahamati, listen well and reflect well  within yourself; I will tell you. 
 
Certainly, Blessed One, said Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva and  gave ear to the Blessed One. 
 
The Blessed One said this to him: Mahamati, the Tathagata is not a  non-entity; nor is he to be conceived as all things are, as neither born  nor disappearing; nor is he to look around for causation [in order to  appear before others]; nor is he without signification; I refer to him  as unborn. (<a name="192"><strong>192</strong></a>) Nevertheless, Mahamati, there  is another name for the Tathagata when his Dharmakaya assumes a  will-body. This is what goes beyond the comprehension of the  philosophers, Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and those Bodhisattvas still  abiding in the seventh stage. The unborn, Mahamati, is synonymous with  the Tathagata. 
 
For instance, Mahamati, Indra is [sometimes known as] Sakra,  [sometimes? as] Purandara; hand is <em>hasta, kara, pani;</em> the body is  <em>tanu, deha, sarira;</em> the earth is <em>prithivi, bhumi, vasumdhara</em>;  the sky is <em>kha, akasa, gagana</em>; all these objects each in its way  are designated with many names, synonymously used and discriminated;  but on account of these different names different objects are not to be  imagined, nor are they without their self-nature. The same, Mahamati,  can be said of myself, for I come within the range of hearing of  ignorant people, in this world of patience, under many names, amounting  to a hundred thousand times three asamkhyeyas, and they address me by  these names not knowing that they are all other names of the Tathagata.  Of these, Mahamati, some recognise me as the Tathagata, some as the  Self-existent One, some as Leader, as Vinayaka (Remover), as Parinayaka  (Guide), as Buddha, as Rishi (Ascetic), as Bull-king, as Brahma, as  Vishnu, as Isvara, as Original Source (<em>pradhana</em>), as Kapila, as  Bhutanta (End of Reality), as Arishta, as Nemina, as Soma (moon), as the  Sun, as Rama, as Vyasa, as Suka, as Indra, as Balin, as Varuna, as is  known to some; while others recognise me as One who is never born and  never passes away, as Emptiness, as Suchness, as Truth, as Reality, as  Limit of Reality, (<a name="193"><strong>193</strong></a>) as the Dharmadhatu, as  Nirvana, as the Eternal, as Sameness, as Non-duality, as the Undying, as  the Formless, as Causation, as the Doctrine of Buddha-cause, as  Emancipation, as the Truth of the Path, as the All-Knower, as the  Victor, as the Will-made Mind. Mahamati, thus in full possession of one  hundred thousand times three asamkhyeyas of appellations, neither more  nor less, in this world and in other worlds, I am known to the peoples,  like the moon in water which is neither in it nor out of it. But this is  not understood by the ignorant who have fallen into the dualistic  conception of continuity._1_ Though they honour, praise,  esteem, and revere me, they do not understand well the meaning of words  and definitions; they do not distinguish ideas, they do not have their  own truth, and, clinging to the words of the canonical books, they  imagine that not being subject to birth and destruction means a  non-entity, and fail to see that it is one of the many names of the  Tathagata as in the case of Indra, Sakra, Purandara. They have no  confidence in the texts where the self-standing truth is revealed, since  in their study of all things they follow mere words as expressed in the  texts trying thereby to gain into the meaning. 
 
<div>_1_ This is missing in T'ang and Sung.</div> 
 
Thus, Mahamati, these deluded ones would declare that as words are so  is meaning, that meaning is not otherwise than words. For what reason?  Because meaning has no body of its own and cannot be different from  words. That the unintelligent declare words to be identical with  meaning, is due to their ignorance as to the self-nature of words. They  do not know, Mahamati, that words (<a name="194"><strong>194</strong></a>) are  subject to birth and death whereas meaning is not. Mahamati, words are  dependent on letters, but meaning is not. As meaning is freed from  existence and non-existence, it is not born, it has no substratum. And,  Mahamati, the Tathagatas do not teach the doctrine that is dependent  upon letters. As to letters, their being or non-being is not attainable;  it is otherwise with the thought that is never dependent on letters.  Again, Mahamati, anyone that discourses on a truth that is dependent on  letters is a mere prattler because truth is beyond letters. For this  reason, Mahamati, it is declared in the canonical text by myself and  other Buddhas and Bodhisattvas that not a letter is uttered or answered  by the Tathagatas. For what reason? Because truths are not dependent on  letters. It is not that they never declare what is in conformity with  meaning; when they declare anything, it is according to the  discrimination [of all beings]. If, Mahamati, the truth is not declared_1_ [in words] the scriptures containing all truths will disappear, and  when the scriptures disappear there will be no Buddhas, Sravakas,  Pratyekabuddhas, and Bodhisattvas; and when there is no one [to teach],  what is to be taught and to whom? For this reason, then, Mahamati, the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva is not to become attached to the words of the  canonical texts. Mahamati, owing to the functioning of the minds of  sentient beings, the canonical texts sometimes deviate from their  straightforward course; religious discourses are given by myself and  other Tathagatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones in response to  varieties of faiths on the part of beings, in order to remove them from  [the bondage of] the Citta, Manas and Manovijnana, and not for the  attainment and establishment of self-realisation which issues from noble  wisdom. When there is the recognition of the fact that all things are  characterised with imagelessness and that there is nothing in the world  but what is seen of the Mind itself, there is the discarding of the  dualistic discrimination. 
 
_1_ According to the Chinese versions. <em>Upadayanupadayat</em> in this connection is not quite intelligible. 
 
Therefore, Mahamati, let the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva be in conformity  with the meaning (<a name="195"><strong>195</strong></a>) and not with the letter.  Mahamati, a son or a daughter of a good family who conforms himself or  herself to the letter will ruin his or her understanding of ultimate  reality_1_ and will cause others to fail to recognise [the  truth]. Continuing to cherish wrong views, one's own assertion is  confounded by the philosophers who do not understand well what  characterises all the stages of the Dharma, and who have no adequate  knowledge as to the interpretation of words. If they well understand  what characterises all the stages of the Dharma and are adequately  equipped with the interpretation of words and expressions, and have a  good understanding of the meaning and reason of all things, they will  properly enjoy by themselves the bliss of formlessness while others are  properly established in the Mahayana. Being properly embraced in the  Mahayana they will, Mahamati, be in the embrace of the Buddhas,  Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and Bodhisattvas. Being embraced by the  Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Pratyekabuddhas, and Sravakas, they will [in  turn] embrace all beings. Embracing all beings they will embrace the  good Dharma. The good Dharma being embraced, the Buddha-seeds will not  be destroyed. When the Buddha-seeds are not destroyed, the excellent  abodes will be attained. When thus these excellent abodes are attained,  Mahamati, the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas will see to it that [all beings],  being established in the Mahayana, are born there [in the excellent  abodes], and fortifying themselves with the tenfold supernatural power  and assuming various forms, (<a name="196"><strong>196</strong></a>) they will  discourse on the Dharma in conformity to its true nature (<em>tathatva</em>),  and with a thorough knowledge of various wishes and characteristics of  beings. Now the true nature of things (<em>tathatva</em>) is characterised  by non-differentiation and trueness, it is neither coming nor  departing, it puts a stop to all idle reasonings, and it is called the  truth (<em>tattvam</em>). 
 
<div>_1_ Read <em>paramartha</em> after Sung and Wei.</div> 
 
Therefore, Mahamati, let son or daughter of a good family take good  heed not to get attached to words as being in perfect conformity with  meaning, because the truth is not of the letter. Be not like the one who  looks at the finger-tip. For instance, Mahamati, when a man with his  finger-tip points at something to somebody, the finger-tip may be taken  wrongly for the thing pointed at; in like manner, Mahamati, the people  belonging to the class of the ignorant and simple-minded, like those of a  childish group, are unable even unto their death to abandon the idea  that in the finger-tip of words there is the meaning itself, and will  not grasp ultimate reality because of their intent clinging to words  which are no more than the finger-tip to them. To give another  illustration, Mahamati: boiled rice is the proper food for infants, to  whom [suppose] somebody gave uncooked food to eat. In this case, this  one is to be considered to be out of his sense because of his not  knowing how to prepare food properly. So it is with that which is  neither born nor destroyed, Mahamati; it will not manifest itself to  anybody unless he is well disciplined in it. Therefore, you should most  assuredly discipline yourself in this and not be like one who grasping  his own finger-tip sees the meaning there. For this reason, Mahamati, (<a name="197"><strong>197</strong></a>) you should energetically discipline yourself  to get at the meaning itself. 
 
Mahamati, the meaning is alone with itself (<em>vivikta</em>) and is  the cause of Nirvana. Words are bound up with discrimination and are the  carrier of transmigration. Meaning, Mahamati, is attained from much  learning, and this much learning, Mahamati, means to be conversant with  meaning and not with words. To be conversant with meaning means [to  ascertain] the view which is not at all associated with any  philosophical school and which will keep not only yourself but others  from falling into [the false views]. Being so, Mahamati, this is said to  be learned much in meaning. Therefore, let seekers for meaning  reverently approach those [who are much learned in it], but those who  are attached to words as being in accord with meaning, they are to be  left to themselves and to be shunned by truth-seekers.

Further, Mahamati to whom the Buddha's spiritual powers were added,  said: There is nothing specially distinguishable in the Buddha's  teaching of no-birth and no-annihilation. Why? Because all the  philosophers also declare, Blessed One, their causes to be unborn and  not to be annihilated; and you, too, Blessed One, declare space,  Aprati-samkhyanirodha (annihilation), and Nirvana to be unborn and not  to be annihilated. The philosophers declare, Blessed One, that the world  rises from causal agencies and causation, while the Blessed One too  declares that the world takes its rise from ignorance, desire, deed,  discrimination, which work in accordance with the law of causation. Both  thus refer to causation, the difference being in names only. 
 
So with the rise of external objects, both you and they assume  external causation. Thus, there is no distinction between your teaching,  Blessed One, and that of the philosophers. [With them] there are nine  substances which are regarded as unborn and not to be annihilated:  atoms, supreme soul (<em>pradhana</em>), Isvara, creator (<em>prajapati</em>),  etc., (<a name="198"><strong>198</strong></a>) while, Blessed One, you assert  that all things are neither born nor annihilated as their being and  non-being is unattainable. Now as the elements are indestructible, their  self-nature is neither born nor annihilated; while following various  courses of transformation, what constitutes their essential nature is  not abandoned. Though your notion of the elements may differ in form,  Blessed One, it is what has been imagined by all the philosophers as  well as by yourself. For this reason this teaching of yours has nothing  distinctive. If there is anything distinctive by which the teaching of  the Tathagata excels that of the philosophers, pray tell me. Blessed  One, if there is nothing distinctive in your own teaching, we can say  that there is something of Buddhahood in the teaching of all the  philosophers, because in them there is a cause pointing to no-birth and  no-annihilation. It was declared by the Blessed One that many Tathagatas  are not born simultaneously in the same district in one world. But if  the rule of cause and effect with regard to being and non-being holds  true, and your own teaching leaves nothing contradicting behind, there  must be many Tathagatas [rising at the same time and in the same  locality]. 
 
The Blessed One said: Mahamati, my [teaching of] no-birth and  no-annihilation is not like that of philosophers who also speak of  no-birth and no-annihilation; nor is it like their doctrine of birth and  impermanency. Why? Because, Mahamati, that to which the philosophers  ascribe the characteristics of no-birth and no-change is the self-nature  of all things. But mine is not that which falls into the dualism of  being and non-being. Mine, Mahamati, goes beyond the dualism of being  and non-being; has nothing to do with birth, abiding, and destruction;  is neither existent nor non-existent. How is it not non-existent?  Because (<a name="199"><strong>199</strong></a>) multitudinousness of objects is  to be seen as like Maya and a dream; I say that it is not non-existent.  How is it not existent? Because there are no characteristic signs to be  perceived as belonging to the self-nature of things; they are seen [in  one sense as individual objects] and not seen [as such in another  sense]; again they are [something in one sense] graspable [and in  another sense] ungraspable. For this reason, things are existent and  non-existent. 
 
But when it is understood that there is nothing in the world but what  is seen of the Mind itself, discrimination no more rises, and one is  thus established in his own abode which is the realm of no-work. The  ignorant work and discriminate but not the wise. Mahamati, [the doings  of the ignorant] are unrealities discriminated, realities confounded;  they are like the city of the Gandharvas, like magically-created  figures. To illustrate, Mahamati, here is a city of the Gandharvas where  children see magically-created people, merchants, and many others,  going in or coming out, and imagine that they are really people going in  and coming out. It is owing to this discrimination characterised by  perturbation that such takes place. It is the same, Mahamati, with the  ignorant that they have a confused perception of birth and no-birth.  There is really nothing made or unmade, like the rising of  magically-created people; for magically-created people are neither born  nor annihilated, because here is no question whatever as to their  existence or non-existence. In like manner, all things have nothing to  do with birth and destruction, except that the ignorant cherishing false  ideas imagine the birth and annihilation of objects. It is, however,  not so with the wise. By false ideas it is meant that objects are not  judged as they are in themselves. They are nothing else. When [reality]  is discriminated other than it is, there is the clinging to the idea  that all things have their self-nature (<a name="200"><strong>200</strong></a>)  and what is alone by itself is not seen, and when what is alone by  itself is not seen there is no disappearance of discrimination. For this  reason, Mahamati, an insight into formlessness excels, and not an  insight into form; as form causes another birth, it excels not. By  formlessness, Mahamati, is meant the disappearance of discrimination. 
 
No-birth and no-annihilation,_1_ this I call Nirvana. By  Nirvana, Mahamati, is meant the looking into the abode of reality as it  really is in itself; and when, along with the turning-back of the entire  system of mentation (<em>citta-caitta-kalapa</em>), there is the  attainment of self-realisation by means of noble wisdom, which belongs  to the Tathagatas, I call it Nirvana._2_

So it is said: 
 
86. In order to remove [the notion of] birth and to accomplish [that  of] no-birth, I teach the doctrine of no-cause; but this is not  understood by the ignorant. 
 
87. This all is unborn, but that does not mean that there are no  objects; they are seen to be like the city of the Gandharvas, a dream,  and Maya; objects are here, but causeless. 
 
88. Tell me how things are unborn, without self-nature_1_ and empty. When things are seen by [transcendental] knowledge, they are  not subject to combination and are unobtainable; therefore, I declare  that they are empty, unborn, and without self-nature. 
 
89. Considered one by one combination is there, the world appears to  exist, but nothing is really existing; it is not as it is conceived by  the philosophers; when combination is dissolved, nothing is left to be  seen. 
 
90. As is a dream, a hair-net, Maya, the city of the Gandharvas, and a  mirage, (<a name="201"><strong>201</strong></a>) which rise into view  causelessly, so is the multitudinousness of the world. 
 
91. By keeping down the theory of no-causation,_2_ no-birth  is demonstrated; when the theory of no-birth is declared, my law-eye_3_ is never destroyed; when the theory of no-cause is pointed out, the  philosophers are horrified. 
 
92. [Mahamati asked]._4_ How, by whom, where, and wherefore  does the theory of no-cause make its appearance? [The Blessed One  answered.]_4_ When things (<em>samskrita</em>) are perceived as  neither subject to causation nor above it, then the view maintained by  the philosophers of birth and destruction is done away with. 
 
93. [Mahamati asked;] Is non-being no-birth? or does it look for  causation? or is it a being's name without a [corresponding] reality?  Pray tell me. 
 
94. [The Blessed One answered,] Non-being is not no-birth, nor does  it look for causation, nor is it a being's name, nor is it a name  without a [corresponding] object. 
 
95. Here is a reality which does not belong to the Sravakas,  Pratyekabuddhas, nor to the philosophers; neither does it belong to the  Bodhisattvas who have entered upon the seventh stage; this is what  characterises no-birth. 
 
_1_ According to Sung and T'ang. 
 
_2_ According to T'ang and Sung, "theory of causation." 
 
_3_ <em>Netri,</em> according to T'ang; Sung has "law-stream"  and Wei "my law." 
 
_4_ According to Sung. 
 
96. The doing away with the notion of cause and condition, the giving  up of a causal agency, the establishment of the Mind-only—this I state  to be no-birth. 
 
97. The getting-rid of [the idea that] things are caused, the removal  of [the dualism of] imagined and imagining, (<a name="202"><strong>202</strong></a>)  the being liberated from the alternatives of being and non-being—this I  state to be no-birth. 
 
98. The mind liberated from its objective world, the getting-rid of  the twofold Svabhava [<em>parikalpita</em> and <em>paratantra</em>], a  turning-up at the seat of mentation—this I state to be no-birth. 
 
99. No external existence, no non-existence, not even the grasping of  mind; [things are like] a dream, a hair-net, Maya, [the city of]  Gandharvas, a mirage;_1_ the abandonment of all the  philosophical views, —this is what characterises no-birth. 
 
100. Thus too all these words will be understood, that is, emptiness,  having no self-nature, etc.; [the world] is empty, not, indeed, because  of its being empty, but because of its being empty in the sense of  being unborn. 
 
101. A system [of mentality] may have its rise and fall owing to  causation; when there is a dissolution of the system, there is neither  birth nor annihilation. 
 
102. When a dissolution somewhere takes place among the members of  the system, such existence ceases as is discriminated by the  philosophers by means of [such categories as] oneness and separateness. 
 
103. Nothing is born; being is not, non-being is not, nowhere is  being-and-non-being; except that where there is a system, there is the  rising of things and their dissolution. 
 
104. It is only in accordance with general convention that a chain_2_ of mutual dependence is talked of; (<a name="203"><strong>203</strong></a>) birth  has no sense when the chain of dependence is severed. 
 
105. As there is nothing generating, there is no-birth, free from the  faults of the philosophers; I talk of this conventionally according [to  the theory of] concatenation, and this is not intelligible to the  ignorant. 
 
_1_ This line may better be dropped as an interpolation. 
 
_2_ <em>Samkata</em>. 
 
106. If there is anything born somewhere apart from concatenation,  here is one who is to be recognised as an advocate of no-causation as he  destroys concatenation. 
 
107. If concatenation works [from outside] like a lamp revealing all  kinds of things, this means the presence of something outside  concatenation itself. 
 
108. All things are devoid of self-nature, have never been born, and  in their original nature are like the sky; things separated from  concatenation belong to the discrimination of the ignorant. 
 
109. There is another kind of no-birth which is the self-essence of  things realised by the wise; its birth is no-birth, and in this no-birth  there is a recognition._1_ 
 
110. When this entire world is regarded as concatenation, as nothing  else but concatenation, then the mind gains tranquillity. 
 
111. Ignorance, desire, karma, etc. —these are the inner  concatenation; a ladle, clay, a vessel, a wheel, etc., or seeds, the  elements, etc. —these are external concatenations. 
 
112. If there is any other existence born of concatenation, this goes  against the law of concatenation; those [who hold this view] are not  established in the principles of correct reasoning. 
 
(<a name="204"><strong>204</strong></a>) 113. If there is an object coming to  exist and yet is non-existent, by what law of causation is there the  recognition of it? Things here are of mutual origination, and for this  reason causation is declared. 
 
114. Heat, fluidity, motility, solidity—such notions are  discriminated by the ignorant; there is a system of relations, no  individual objects exist; hence the denial of self-nature [as  constituting the realness of objects]. 
 
115. The physician varies his treatment according to diseases though  there is no difference in the principle [of healing]; the difference  comes from varieties of diseases. 
 
_1_ This is what constitutes <em>anutpattikadharmakshanti</em>,  the "recognition of all things as unborn," which is considered the  supreme spiritual attainment of Bodhisattvas. 
 
116. In like manner, [in order to save] generations of beings from  their disease of passions with which they are ill, I teach people with  my doctrines, knowing the power of their senses. 
 
117. My doctrine does not vary, but the passions and powers are  differentiated; there is just one vehicle; auspicious is the eightfold  path.

At that time again, Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said this to  the Blessed One: Impermanence, impermanence—this is the discrimination  of the philosophers, Blessed One, and you, too, declare in the canonical  texts that all composite things are impermanent, to be subject to birth  and destruction is the nature of things; but, Blessed One, is this  right or wrong? And how many kinds of impermanency [are there], Blessed  One? 
 
Said the Blessed One: Mahamati, there are eight_1_ kinds of  impermanency as discriminated by the philosophers, but not by me. What  are the eight kinds? (1) Some say (<a name="205"><strong>205</strong></a>) that  there is origination and then cessation—this is impermanency: that is to  say, Mahamati, in the beginning there is something born which ceases to  exist—this is impermanency. (2) Some explain impermanency as the  changing of shape. (3) Some say, form_2_ itself is impermanent.  (4) Some regard impermanency to consist in the changing of form (<em>rupa</em>),  saying that in a continuous, uninterrupted existence of all things  there takes place a change in their natural flavour; for instance, milk  going through a transformation turns into sour milk, and that such an  invisible decomposition happens to all things; this is called  impermanency. (5) Some imagine that there is an objective existence (<em>bhava</em>)  which is called impermanency. (6) Some imagine that existence and  non-existence—this is impermanency. (7) Some say that not being born is  impermanency; because of all things being impermanent, and because of  impermanency being inherent in them._3_ 
 
_1_ Both T'ang and Sung have seven, not eight. The present  text also enumerates only seven; the missing one is supplied in a  footnote from Wei. 
 
_2_ Or matter, <em>rupa</em>. 
 
_3_ This is the eighth in Wei, and for the seventh Wei has  this: "Again there are other philosophers according to whom impermanency  consists in not being [existent] at first but coming later to exist.  That is to say, when things born of the elements cease to exist, nothing  is seen, nothing is born, as they are separated from the substances  that subsist—this is called impermanency." 
 
Now, Mahamati, by impermanency that exists in existence and  non-existence, is meant that things made of the elements_1_ are  by nature subject to destruction and have nothing in them one can take  hold of, while the elements themselves are never set in motion. 
 
By impermanency that is no-birth is meant that there is neither_2_ permanency nor impermanency; that in all things there is no [dualistic]  evolution of being and non-being, and that nothing is seen to exist,  even when they are examined into the last atom. This not seeing of  anything is another name for no-birth, and not for birth. This,  Mahamati, is the nature of impermanency that is no-birth, and as this is  not understood, all the philosophers cherish the view of impermanency  that is based on birth. 
 
_1_ <em>Bhuta</em> before <em>bhautika</em> (line 10) may better  be dropped. 
 
_2_ The negative particle <em>na</em> is inserted here  according to Sung. 
 
Further, Mahamati, by the conception of impermanency as objective  existence is meant that there is a discrimination in [the philosopher's]  own mind as to that which is not permanent and that which is not  impermanent. What is the sense of this? (<a name="206"><strong>206</strong></a>)  It means that there is a thing called impermanency which in itself is  not subject to destruction, but by whose working there is the  disappearance of all things; and if not for impermanency there will be  no disappearance of all things. It is like a stick or a stone, or like a  hammer breaking other things to pieces while itself remains unbroken.  [This is the philosopher's meaning but] as we actually see things about  us, there is no such mutual differentiation which compels us to say that  here is impermanency the cause, and there is the disappearance of all  things as the effect; there is no such differentiation of cause and  effect, and we cannot say: Here is impermanency as cause and there is  the effect. When there is thus no differentiation of cause and effect,  all things are permanent since no cause exists to render them otherwise.  Mahamati, as to the disappearance of all things, there is a cause, but  it is not in the understanding of the ignorant and simple-minded. When  the cause is of a dissimilar nature, the [same] effect is not produced.  In case it does, the impermanency of all things is an example of  dissimilar effect, and there is no distinction between cause and effect.  But the distinction between cause and effect is observed in them. If  there is an [objective] existence to be known as impermanence, it will  be characterised with the nature of an effect-producing cause, and there  will be one entity contained in all things. When the notion is  cherished of a cause-producing effect, this means that impermanence the  cause is impermanent because it partakes of the nature of the effect  which is impermanent. All things then are not to be regarded as  impermanent but as permanent. 
 
If impermanency [as the cause] resides within all things, it will  come under the three divisions of time. It passes away together with  things past; its future is not yet here as things of the future are  still unborn; in the present it breaks up together with things of the  present. 
 
(<a name="207"><strong>207</strong></a>) Form [or matter] results from the  combination and variation of the elements; as the primary elements and  the secondary elements are neither different nor not-different, they are  by nature not subject to destruction, because according to the  philosophers the elements are indestructible. [But, Mahamati,] it is an  established fact that the entire triple world with its elements primary  and secondary is born, abides, and disappears. How do the philosophers  conceive a separate existence of impermanency which is independent of  the elements primary and secondary, while the elements themselves are  neither set in motion nor destroyed because they cling to the notion of  self-nature [as eternally unchangeable]? 
 
The conception of impermanency as existing in the first origination  which ceases to continue [is not tenable for three reasons]; the  elements cannot produce one another, because each has its self-nature  different from the others. Each individual one cannot produce itself  because there is no differentiation in it. The [mutually] separated  origination of the elements is impossible because there is no  correspondence between the two. Hence the conclusion that the conception  of origination-impermanency is untenable. 
 
By the conception of impermanency in consideration of changes taking  place in external form is meant that the elements primary and secondary  are not subject to dissolution. What is known as dissolution, Mahamati,  even when closely examined until atoms are reached, is not the  destruction of the elements primary and secondary but of their external  forms whereby the elements assume different appearances as short or  long; but, in fact, nothing is destroyed in the elemental atoms. What is  seen as ceased to exist is the external formation of the elements. This  view is cherished by the Samkhya school. 
 
By the impermanency of external shapes is meant the impermanency of  form (<em>rupa</em>); (<a name="208"><strong>208</strong></a>) what is impermanent  is thus the external shape and not the elements. If the elements  themselves are impermanent all our everyday experiences come to naught.  This is cherishing the view of the Lokayatika, according to which all  things are reducible to mere words because their self-nature is never  seen as born. 
 
By the impermanency of changes is meant the changing of forms (<em>rupa</em>)  and not the changing of the elements themselves as is seen in various  ornamental articles of gold which assume various forms. While there is  no disappearance in the nature of gold, the ornamental articles  variously change in form. 
 
These and other views of impermanency as changes are discriminated  variously by the philosophers as is here described. Fire may burn all  the elements but their self-nature can never be burned; when each goes  asunder by itself, there is the destruction of what constitutes the  elements primary and secondary. 
 
However, Mahamati, I am neither for permanency nor for impermanency.  Why? For these reasons: external objects are not admitted; the triple  world is taught as not being anything else but the Mind itself;  multiplicities of external existences are not accepted; there is no  rising of the elements, nor their disappearance, nor their continuation,  nor their differentiation; there are no such things as the elements  primary and secondary; because of discrimination there evolve the  dualistic indications of perceived and perceiving; when it is recognised  that because of discrimination there is a duality, the discussion  concerning the existence and non-existence of the external world ceases  because Mind-only is understood. Discrimination (<a name="209"><strong>209</strong></a>)  rises from discriminating a world of effect-producing works; no  discrimination takes place when this world is not recognised._1_ Then a man ceases to cherish the discrimination of existence and  non-existence which rises out of his own mind, he sees that things,  either of this world or of a higher world, or of the highest, are not to  be described as permanent or impermanent, because he does not  understand the truth that there is nothing in the world but what is seen  of the Mind itself. As [the meaning of] discrimination is not  understood by all the philosophers who have fallen into wrong ideas of  dualism and who are people of no [spiritual] attainment, impermanency  comes up to them as a subject for discussion. Mahamati,_2_ the  triple aspect of all things as distinguished as of this world, of a  higher world, and of the highest, is the outcome of word-discrimination,  but this is not understood by the ignorant and simple-minded. So it is  said: 
 
118. By the deluded philosophers the notion of impermanency is  discriminated as origination-cessation, as transformation of external  forms, as an [independent] existence, as form. 
 
_1_ Read after the Chinese. 
 
_2_ <em>Sarvatirthakara</em> (line 6) is dropped, according to  the Chinese. 
 
119. There is no destruction of things; the elements abide for ever  as regards their self-essence; immersed in varieties of views the  philosophers discriminate impermanency. 
 
120. To these philosophers there is no destruction, no birth; the  elements are permanent as regards their self-essence; who ever  discriminates impermanency? [This is the position of the philosophers.] 
 
121. [According to the Buddha,] there is nothing in the world but the  Mind itself, and all that is of duality has its rise from the Mind and  is seen as perceived and perceiving; an ego-soul and what belongs to  it—they exist not. 
 
122. The abode and realm of Brahma, etc. —I declare all to be of  Mind-only, (<a name="210"><strong>210</strong></a>) outside Mind-only, Brahma,  etc., are not attainable.

(<a name="211"><strong>211</strong></a>) At that time again Mahamati the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said this to the Blessed One: Pray tell me,  Blessed One, about the state of perfect tranquillisation (<em>nirodha</em>)  and its further development as attained by all the Bodhisattvas,  Sravakas, and Pratyekabuddhas; for when this further development is  thoroughly understood by myself and other Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas all  may be saved from being confounded by the happiness which comes from the  attainment of perfect tranquillisation and also from falling into the  confused state of mind of the Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and  philosophers. 
 
Said the Blessed One: Then listen well and reflect well within  yourself; I will tell you. 
 
Certainly, Blessed One, said Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva and  gave ear to the Blessed One. 
 
The Blessed One said this to him: Those Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas who  have reached the sixth stage as well as all the Sravakas and  Pratyekabuddhas attain perfect tranquillisation. At the seventh stage,  the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas, giving up the view of self-nature as  subsisting in all things, attain perfect tranquillisation in every  minute of their mental lives, which is not however the case with the  Sravakas and Pratyekabuddhas; for with them there is something  effect-producing, and in their attainment of perfect tranquillisation  there is a trace [of dualism], of grasped and grasping. Therefore, they  do not attain perfect tranquillisation in every minute of their mental  lives which is possible at the seventh stage. They cannot attain to [the  clear conviction of] an undifferentiated state of all things (<a name="212"><strong>212</strong></a>) and the cessation of [all] multiplicities.  Their attainment is due to understanding the aspect of all things in  which their self-nature is discriminated as good and as not-good.  Therefore, until the seventh stage there is not a well-established  attainment of tranquillisation in every minute of their mental lives. 
 
Mahamati, at the eighth stage the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas, Sravakas,  and Pratyekabuddhas cease cherishing discriminative ideas that arise  from the Citta, Mana and Manovijnana. From the first stage up to the  sixth, they perceive that the triple world is no more than the Citta.  Manas, and Manovijnana, that as it is born of a discriminating mind  there is no ego-soul and what belongs to it, and that there is no  falling into the multitudinousness of external objects except through  [the discrimination of] the Mind itself. The ignorant turning their  self-knowledge (<em>svajnana</em>) towards the dualism of grasped and  grasping fail to understand, for there is the working of habit-energy  which has "been accumulating since beginningless time owing to false  reasoning and discrimination. 
 
Mahamati, at the eighth stage there is Nirvana for the Sravakas and  Pratyekabuddhas and Bodhisattvas; but the Bodhisattvas are kept away by  the power of all the Buddhas_1 _from [being intoxicated by] the  bliss of the Samadhi, and thereby they will not enter into Nirvana.  When the stage of Tathagatahood is not fulfilled there would be the  cessation of all doings, and if [the Bodhisattvas] were not supported  [by the Buddhas] the Tathagata-family would become extinct. Therefore,  the Buddhas, the Blessed Ones, point out the virtues of Buddhahood which  are beyond conception. (<a name="213"><strong>213</strong></a>) Therefore, [the  Bodhisattvas] do not enter into Nirvana, but the Sravakas and  Pratyekabuddhas, engrossed in the bliss of the Samadhis, therein cherish  the thought of Nirvana. 
 
<div>_1_ Read according to T'ang.</div> 
 
At the seventh stage, Mahamati, the Bodhisattva properly examines  into the nature of the Citta, Manas, and Manovijnana; he examines into  [such subjects as] ego-soul and what belongs_1_ to it, grasped  and grasping, the egolessness of persons and things, rising and  disappearing, individuality and generality; he skilfully ascertains the  fourfold logical analysis; he enjoys the bliss of self-mastery; he  enters successively upon the stages; he knows the differences obtaining  in the various elements of enlightenment. The grading of the stages is  arranged by me lest the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva, not knowing what is  meant by individuality and generality and failing to understand the  continuous development of the successive stages, should fall into the  philosophers' wrong way of viewing things. But, Mahamati, there is  really nothing rising, nothing disappearing, all is nothing except what  is seen of the Mind itself; that is, the continuous development of the  successive stages and all the multiple doings of the triple world [—they  are all of Mind itself]. This is not understood by the ignorant. I and  all the Buddhas_1_ establish the doctrine of the stages which  develop successively as do all the doings of the triple world. 
 
<div>_1_ The Chinese reading is here adopted.</div> 
 
Further, Mahamati, the Sravakas and Pratyekabuddhas at the eighth  stage of Bodhisattvahood are so intoxicated with the happiness that  comes from the attainment of perfect tranquillisation, and, failing to  understand fully that there is nothing in the world but what is seen of  the Mind itself, they are thus unable to overcome the hindrances and  habit-energy growing out of their notions of generality and  individuality; and adhering to the egolessness of persons and things and  (<a name="214"><strong>214</strong></a>) cherishing views arising therefrom, they  have the discriminating idea and knowledge of Nirvana, which is not  that of the truth of absolute solitude. Mahamati, when the Bodhisattvas  face and perceive the happiness of the Samadhi of perfect  tranquillisation, they are moved with the feeling of love and sympathy  owing to their original vows, and they become aware of the part they are  to perform as regards the [ten] inexhaustible vows. Thus, they do not  enter Nirvana. But the fact is that they are already in Nirvana because  in them there is no rising of discrimination. With them the  discrimination of grasped and grasping no more takes place; as they  [now] recognise that there is nothing in the world but what is seen of  the Mind itself, they have done away with the thought of discrimination  concerning all things. They have abandoned adhering to and  discriminating about such notions as the Citta, Manas, and Manovijnana,  and external objects, and self-nature; however, they have not given up  the things promoting the cause of Buddhism; because of their attainment  of the inner insight which belongs to the stage of Tathagatahood;  whatever they do all issues from their transcendental knowledge. 
 
It is like a man crossing a stream in a dream. For instance,  Mahamati, suppose that while sleeping a man dreams that he is in the  midst of a great river which he earnestly endeavours with all his might  to cross by himself; but before he succeeds in crossing the stream, he  is awakened from the dream, and being awakened he thinks: "Is this real  or unreal?" He thinks again: "No, it is neither real nor unreal. By  reason of the habit-energy of discrimination which has been accumulated  by experience ever since beginningless time, as multiplicities of forms  and conditions are seen, heard, thought, and recognised, there is the  perception and discrimination of all things as existent and nonexistent;  and for this reason my Manovijnana experiences even in a dream all that  has been seen by myself." 
 
In the same way, Mahamati, the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas of the eighth  stage of Bodhisattvahood, (<a name="215"><strong>215</strong></a>) after passing  through the first up to the seventh stage, observe that "there is no  more rising in them of discrimination since all things are seen as like  Maya, etc., when they have an intuitive understanding of the [true]  nature of all things, and [further] observing that, therefore, there is  the cessation of all things as to grasped and grasping which rise from  one's ardent desire for things, and also observing how the mind and what  belongs to it carry on their discrimination, the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas never relax their efforts to practise the  teachings of the Buddhas. Mahamati, they will exercise themselves to  make those who have not yet attained the truth attain it. For the  Bodhisattvas, Nirvana does not mean extinction; as they have abandoned  thoughts of discrimination evolving from the Citta, Manas, and  Manovijnana, there is for them the attainment of the recognition that  all things are unborn. And, Mahamati, in ultimate reality there is  neither gradation nor continuous succession; [only] the truth of  absolute solitude (<em>viviktadharma</em>) is taught here in which the  discrimination of all the images is quieted. So it is said: 
 
1. The abodes and the stages of Buddhahood are established in_1_ the Mind-only which is imageless—this was told, is told, and will be  told by the Buddhas. 
 
2. The [first] seven stages are [still] of the mind, but here the  eighth is imageless; the two stages, [the ninth and the tenth,] have  [still] something to rest themselves on; the [highest] stage that is  left belongs to me. 
 
3. Self-realisation and absolute purity—this stage is my own; it is  the highest station of Mahesvara, the Akanishtha [heaven] shining  brilliantly. 
 
4. Its rays of light move forward like a mass of fire; they who are  bright-coloured, charming, and auspicious transform the triple world. 
 
5. Some worlds are being transformed, while others have already been  transformed;_2_ there I preach the various vehicles which  belong to my own stage. 
 
(<a name="216"><strong>216</strong></a>) 6. But [from the absolute point of  view] the tenth is the first, and the first is the eighth; and the ninth  is the seventh, and the seventh is the eighth. 
 
7. And the second is the third, and the fourth is the fifth, and the  third is the sixth; what gradation is there where imagelessness  prevails?

(<a name="217"><strong>217</strong></a>) At that time again, Mahamati the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said this to the Blessed One: Is the Blessed One,  the Tathagata, the Arhat, the Fully-Enlightened One, permanent or  impermanent? 
 
Said the Blessed One: Mahamati, the Tathagata is neither permanent  nor impermanent. Why? Because either way there is a fault connected with  it. Mahamati, what fault is connected with either assertion?_1_ If the Tathagata is permanent, he will be connected with the creating  agencies. For, Mahamati, according to all the philosophers the creating  agencies are something uncreated and permanent. But the Tathagata is not  permanent [in the same sense] as the uncreated are permanent. If he is  impermanent, he will be connected with things created. Because the  Skandhas which are predicable as qualified and qualifying are  nonexistent, and because the Skandhas are subject to annihilation,  destructibility is their nature. Mahamati, all that is created is  impermanent as is a jug, a garment, straw, a piece of wood, a brick,  etc., which are all connected with impermanency. Thus all the  preparations for the knowledge of the All-Knowing One will become  useless as they are things created. On account of no distinction being  made, the Tathagata, indeed, would be something created. For this  reason, the Tathagata is neither permanent nor impermanent. 
 
<div>_1_ Following T'ang.</div> 
 
Again, Mahamati, the Tathagata is not permanent for the reason that  [if he were] he would be like space, and the preparations one makes for  Tathagatahood would be useless. That is to say, Mahamati, space is  neither permanent nor impermanent as it excludes [the idea of]  permanence and impermanence, (<a name="218"><strong>218</strong></a>) and it is  improper to speak of it as characterised with the faults of oneness and  otherness, of bothness and not-bothness, of permanence and impermanence.  Further, Mahamati, it is like the horns of a hare, or a horse, or an  ass, or a camel, or a frog, or a snake, or a fly, or a fish; [with the  Tathagata] as with them here is the permanency of no-birth. Because of  this fault of the permanency of no-birth, the Tathagata cannot be  permanent. 
 
However, Mahamati, there is another sense in which the Tathagata can  be said to be permanent. How? Because the knowledge arising from the  attainment of enlightenment [ = an intuitive understanding] is of a  permanent nature, the Tathagata is permanent. Mahamati, this knowledge,  as it is attained intuitively by the Tathagatas, Arhats,  Fully-Enlightened Ones, is, indeed, permanent. Whether the Tathagatas  are born or not, this Dharmata, which is the regulative and sustaining  principle to be discoverable in the enlightenment of all the Sravakas,  Pratyekabuddhas, and philosophers, abides, and this sustaining principle  of existence is not like the emptiness of space, which, however, is not  understood by the ignorant and simple-minded. Mahamati, this knowledge  of enlightenment belonging to the Tathagatas comes forth from  transcendental knowledge (<em>prajnajnana</em>); Mahamati, the Tathagatas,  Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones do not come forth from the habit-energy  of ignorance which is concerned with the Citta, Manas, and Manovijnana,  and the Skandhas, Dhatus, and Ayatanas. The triple world originates from  the discriminating of unrealities, but the Tathagatas do not originate  from the discriminating of unrealities. Where duality obtains, Mahamati,  there is permanency and impermanency because of its not being one.  Mahamati, [the truth of] absolute solitude is, indeed, non-dualistic_1_ because all things are characterised with non-duality and no-birth. For  this reason, Mahamati, the Tathagatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones  are neither permanent nor impermanent. Mahamati, as long as there is  word-discrimination, (<a name="219"><strong>219</strong></a>) there follows the  faulty notion of permanency and impermanency. The destruction of the  notion of permanency and impermanency as held by the ignorant, Mahamati,  comes from the getting rid of the knowledge that is based on  discrimination, and not from the getting rid of the knowledge that is  based on the insight of solitude. So it is said: 
 
1. By keeping away permanency and impermanency, [and yet] by keeping  permanency and impermanency in sight, those who always see the Buddhas  will not expose themselves to the power of the philosophical doctrines. 
 
2. When permanency and impermanency are adhered to all the  accumulation [one makes for the attainment of reality] will be of no  avail; by destroying the knowledge that is based on discrimination, [the  idea of] permanency and impermanency is kept back. 
 
3. As soon as an assertion is made, all is in confusion; when it is  understood that there is nothing in the world but what is seen of the  Mind itself, disputes never arise.

(<a name="220"><strong>220</strong></a>) At that time again, Mahamati the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva made a request of the Blessed One, saying:  Blessed One, tell me; Sugata, tell me about the rising and disappearing  of the Skandhas, Dhatus, and Ayatanas. In case there is no ego-soul,  what is it that comes to exist and to disappear? The ignorant who are  attached to the notion of rising and disappearing, fail to understand  the extinction of pain, and thus they know not what Nirvana is. 
 
Said the Blessed One: Then, Mahamati, listen well and reflect well  within yourself; I will tell you. 
 
Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said: Certainly, Blessed One; and  gave ear to the Blessed One. 
 
The Blessed One said this to him: Mahamati, the Tathagata-garbha  holds within it the cause for both good and evil, and by it all the  forms of existence are produced. Like an actor it takes on a variety of  forms, and [in itself] is devoid of an ego-soul and what belongs to it.  As this is not understood, there is the functioning together of the  triple combination from which effects take place. But the philosophers  not knowing this are tenaciously attached to the idea of a cause [or a  creating agency]. Because of the influence of habit-energy that has been  accumulating variously by false reasoning since beginningless time,  what here goes under the name of Alayavijnana is accompanied by the  seven Vijnanas which give birth to a state known as the abode of  ignorance. It is like a great ocean in which the waves roll on  permanently but the [deeps remain unmoved; that is, the Alaya-] body  itself subsists uninterruptedly, quite free from fault of impermanence,  unconcerned with the doctrine of ego-substance, and (<a name="221"><strong>221</strong></a>)  thoroughly pure in its essential nature. 
 
As to the other seven Vijnanas beginning with the Manas and  Manovijnana, they have their rise and complete ending from moment to  moment; they are born with false discrimination as cause, and with forms  and appearances and objectivity as conditions which are intimately  linked together; adhering to names and forms, they do not realise that  objective individual forms are no_1_ more than what is seen of  the Mind itself; they do not give exact information regarding pleasure  and pain; they are not the cause of emancipation; by setting up names  and forms which originate from greed, greed is begotten in turn, thus  mutually conditioned and conditioning. When the sense-organs which seize  [upon the objective world] are destroyed and annihilated, the other  things immediately cease to function, and there is no recognition of  pleasure and pain which are the self-discrimination of knowledge; thus  there is the attainment of perfect tranquillisation in which thoughts  and sensations are quieted, or there is the realisation of the four  Dhyanas, in which truths of emancipation are well understood; whereupon  the Yogins are led to cherish herein the notion of [true] emancipation,  because of the not-rising [of the Vijnanas]. 
 
_1_ According to T'ang and Sung. 
 
[But] when a revulsion [or turning-back] has not taken place in the  Alayavijnana known under the name of Tathagata-garbha, there is no  cessation of the seven evolving Vijnanas. Why? Because the evolution of  the Vijnanas is depending on this cause; but this does not belong to the  realm of the Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and those who are disciplining  themselves in the exercises of the philosophers. As they [only] know the  egolessness of the self-soul, as they [only] accept the individuality  and generality of the Skandhas, Dhatus, and Ayatanas, there is the  evolving of the Tathagata-garbha. When an insight into the five Dharmas,  the three Svabhavas, and the egolessness of all things is obtained, the  Tathagata-garbha becomes quiescent. By causing a revulsion in the  continuous development of the graded stages, [the Bodhisattva] may not  be led astray in the path [of enlightenment] by those philosophers who  hold different views. Thus establishing himself at the Bodhisattva stage  of Acala (immovable), (<a name="222"><strong>222</strong></a>) he obtains the  paths leading to the happiness of the ten Samadhis. Supported by the  Buddhas in Samadhi, observing the truths of the Buddha which go beyond  thought and his own original vows, not entering into the happiness of  the Samadhi which is the limit of reality, but by means of the  self-realisation which is not generally gained by the paths of  discipline belonging to the Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and philosophers,  he obtains the ten paths of discipline which belong to the noble family  [of the Tathagatas], and [also obtains] the knowledge-body created by  the will which is removed from the [premeditated] workings of Samadhi.  For this reason, Mahamati, let those Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas who are  seeking after the exalted truth effect the purification of the  Tathagata-garbha which is known as Alayavijnana. 
 
Mahamati, if you say that there is no Tathagata-garbha known as  Alayavijnana, there will be neither the rising nor the disappearing [of  an external world of multiplicities] in the absence of the  Tathagata-garbha known as Alayavijnana. But, Mahamati, there is the  rising and disappearing of the ignorant as well as the holy ones.  [Therefore], the Yogins, while walking in the noble path of  self-realisation and abiding in the enjoyment of things as they are, do  not abandon working hard and are never frustrated [in their  undertakings]. Mahamati, this realm of the Tathagata-garbha is primarily  undefiled and is beyond all the speculative theories of the Sravakas,  Pratyekabuddhas, and philosophers; but it appears to them devoid of  purity, as it is soiled by these external defilements. This is not the  case with the Tathagatas, Mahamati; with the Tathagatas it is an  intuitive experience as if it were an Amalaka fruit held in the palm of  the hand. 
 
This, Mahamati, was told by me in the canonical text relating to  Queen Srimala, (<a name="223"><strong>223</strong></a>) and in another where the  Bodhisattvas, endowed with subtle, fine, pure knowledge, are supported  [by my spiritual powers] —that the Tathagata-garbha known as  Alayavijnana evolves together with the seven Vijnanas. This is meant for  the Sravakas who are not free from attachment, to make them see into  the egolessness of things; and for Queen Srimala to whom the Buddha's  spiritual power was added, the [pure] realm of Tathagatahood was  expounded. This does not belong to the realm of speculation as it is  carried on by the Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and other philosophers,  except, Mahamati, that this realm of Tathagatahood which is the realm of  the Tathagata-garbha-alayavijnana is meant for those  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas who like you are endowed with subtle, fine,  penetrating thought-power and whose understanding is in accordance with  the meaning; and it is not for others, such as philosophers, Sravakas,  and Pratyekabuddhas, who are attached to the letters of the canonical  texts. For this reason, Mahamati, let you and other  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas discipline yourselves in the realm of  Tathagatahood, in the understanding of this  Tathagata-garbha-alayavijnana, so that you may not rest contented with  mere learning. So it is said: 
 
1. The Garbha of the Tathagatas is indeed united with the seven  Vijnanas; when this is adhered to, there arises duality, but when  rightly understood, duality ceases. 
 
2. The mind, which is the product of intellection since beginningless  time, is seen like a mere image; when things are viewed as they are in  themselves, there is neither objectivity nor its appearance. 
 
3. As the ignorant grasp the finger-tip and not the moon, (<a name="224"><strong>224</strong></a>) so those who cling to the letter, know not my  truth. 
 
4. The Citta dances like a dancer; the Manas resembles a jester; the  [Mano-] vijnana together with the five [Vijnanas] creates an objective  world which is like a stage._1_

</a> 
 
At that time, Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva made a request of  the Blessed One, saying: Pray tell me, Blessed One; pray tell me,  Sugata, concerning the distinguishing aspects of the five Dharmas, the  [three] Svabhavas, the [eight] Vijnanas, and the twofold egolessness. By  [recognising] the distinguishing aspects of the twofold egolessness, I  and other Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas will be able to establish those truths  while effecting a continuous development through the various stages of  Bodhisattvahood. It is said that by these truths we can enter into all  the Buddha-truths, and that by entering into all the Buddha-truths we  can enter even into the ground of the Tathagata's inner realisation. 
 
Said the Blessed One: Then, Mahamati, listen well and reflect well  within yourself; I will tell you. 
 
Certainly, Blessed One, said Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva and  gave ear to the Blessed One. 
 
The Blessed One said this to him: Mahamati, I will tell you about the  distinguishing aspects of the five Dharmas, the [three] Svabhavas, the  [eight] Vijnanas, and the twofold egolessness. The five Dharmas are:  name, form, discrimination, right knowledge, and suchness. [When these  are thoroughly comprehended] by the Yogins, they enter into the course  of the Tathagata's inner realisation, where they are kept away from such  views as eternalism and nihilism, realism and negativism, and (<a name="225"><strong>225</strong></a>) where they come face to face with the abode  of happiness belonging to the present existence as well as to the  Samapatti (tranquillisation). But, Mahamati, as the ignorant do not  understand that the five Dharmas, the [three] Svabhavas, the [eight]  Vijnanas, and the twofold egolessness, together with the external  objects which are regarded as existent and nonexistent— [all these are  no more than] what is seen of the Mind itself—they are given to  discrimination, but it is otherwise with the wise. 
 
Said Mahamati: How is it that the ignorant are given up to  discrimination and the wise are not? 
 
Said the Blessed One: Mahamati, the ignorant cling to names, ideas,  and signs; their minds move along [these channels]. As thus they move  along, they feed on multiplicities of objects, and fall into the notion  of an ego-soul and what belongs to it, and cling to salutary  appearances. As thus they cling, there is a reversion to ignorance, and  they become tainted, karma born of greed, anger, and folly is  accumulated. As karma is accumulated again and again, their minds become  swathed in the cocoon of discrimination as the silk-worm; and,  transmigrating in the ocean of birth-and-death (<em>gati</em>), they are  unable, like the water-drawing wheel, to move forward. And because of  folly, they do not understand that all things are like Maya, a mirage,  the moon in water, and have no self-substance to be imagined as an  ego-soul and its belongings; that things rise from their false  discrimination; that they are devoid of qualified and qualifying; and  have nothing to do with the course of birth, abiding, and destruction;  that they are born of the discrimination of what is only seen of the  Mind itself; and assert_1_ that they are born of Isvara, time,  atoms, or a supreme spirit, for they follow names and appearances.  Mahamati, the ignorant move along with appearances. 
 
Further, Mahamati, by "appearance" is meant that which reveals itself  to the visual sense (<a name="226"><strong>226</strong></a>) and is perceived as  form, and in like manner that which, appearing to the sense of hearing,  smelling, tasting, the body, and the Manovijnana, is perceived as sound,  odour, taste, tactility, and idea, —all this I call "appearance." 
 
Further, Mahamati, by "discrimination" is meant that by which names  are declared, and there is thus the indicating of [various] appearances.  Saying that this is such and no other, for instance, saying that this  is an elephant, a horse, a wheel, a pedestrian, a woman, or a man, each  idea thus discriminated is so determined. 
 
_1_ According to T'ang and Wei. 
 
Further, Mahamati, by "right knowledge" is meant this: when names and  appearances are seen as unobtainable owing to their mutual  conditioning, there is no more rising of the Vijnanas, for nothing comes  to annihilation, nothing abides everlastingly; and when there is thus  no falling back into the stage of the philosophers, Sravakas, and  Pratyekabuddhas, it is said that there is right knowledge. Further,  Mahamati, by reason of this right knowledge, the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva  does not regard name as reality and appearance as non-reality. 
 
When erroneous views based on the dualistic notion of assertion and  negation are gotten rid of, and when the Vijnanas cease to rise as  regards the objective world of names and appearances, this I call  "suchness." Mahamati, a Bodhisattva-Mahasattva who is established on  suchness attains the state of imagelessness and thereby attains the  Bodhisattva-stage of Joy (<em>pramudita</em>). 
 
When [the Bodhisattva] attains the stage of Joy, he is kept away from  all the evil courses belonging to the philosophers and enters upon the  path of supra-worldly truths. When [all] the conditions [of truth] are  brought to consummation, he discerns that the course of all things  starts with the notion of Maya, etc.; and after the attainment of the  noble truth of self-realisation, he earnestly desires to put a stop to  speculative theorisation; (<a name="227"><strong>227</strong></a>) and going up in  succession through the stages of Bodhisattvahood he finally reaches the  stage of Dharma-Cloud (<em>dharmamegha</em>). After being at the stage of  Dharma-Cloud, he reaches as far as the stage of Tathagatahood where the  flowers of the Samadhis, powers, self-control, and psychic faculties  are in bloom. After reaching here, in order to bring all beings to  maturity, he shines like the moon in water, with varieties of rays of  transformation. Perfectly fulfilling_1_ the [ten] inexhaustible  vows, he preaches the Dharma to all beings according to their various  understandings. As the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas, Mahamati, have entered  into suchness, they attain the body which is free from the will and  thought-constructions._2_ 
 
Again, Mahamati said: Are the three Svabhavas to be regarded as  included in the five Dharmas, or as having their own characteristics  complete in themselves? 
 
_1_ According to Sung and T'ang. 
 
_2_ T'ang and Wei have <em>citta-mano-manovijnanarahitam</em>. 
 
The Blessed One said: The three Svabhavas, the eight Vijnanas, and  the twofold egolessness—they are all included [in the five Dharmas]. Of  these, name and appearance are known as the Parikalpita [false  imagination]. Then, Mahamati, discrimination which rises depending upon  them, is the notion of an ego-soul and what belongs to it, —the notion  and the discrimination are of simultaneous occurrence, like the rising  of the sun and its rays. Mahamati, the discrimination thus supporting  the notion of self-nature which subsists in the multiplicities of  objects, is called the Paratantra [dependence on another]. Right  knowledge and suchness, Mahamati, are indestructible, and thus they are  known as Parinishpanna [perfect knowledge]. 
 
Further, Mahamati, by adhering to what is seen of the Mind itself  there is an eightfold discrimination. This comes from imagining unreal  individual appearances [as real]. (<a name="228"><strong>228</strong></a>) When  the twofold clinging to an ego-soul and what belongs to it is stopped,  there is the birth of the twofold egolessness. Mahamati, in these five  Dharmas are included all the Buddha-truths and also the differentiation  and succession of the [Bodhisattva-] stages, and the entrance of the  Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Tathagatas into the state  of self-realisation by means of their noble wisdom.

Further, Mahamati, of the five Dharmas—name, appearance,  discrimination, right knowledge, and suchness— appearance is that which  is seen as having such characteristics as form, shape, distinctive  features, images, colours, etc. —this is "appearance." Out of this  appearance ideas are formed such as a jar, etc., by which one can say,  this is such and such, and no other; this is "name." When names are thus  pronounced, appearances are determined_1_ and there is  "discrimination, " saying this is mind and this is what belongs to it.  That these names and appearances are after all unobtainable because when  intellection is put away the aspect of mutuality [in which all things  are determined] ceases to be perceived and imagined—this is called the  "suchness" of things. And this suchness may be characterised as truth,  reality, exact knowledge, limit, source, self-substance, the  unattainable. This has been realised by myself and the Tathagatas,  truthfully pointed out, recognised, made public, and widely shown. When,  in agreement with this, [the truth] is rightly understood as neither  negative nor affirmative, discrimination ceases to rise, and there is a  state conformable to self-realisation by means of noble wisdom, which is  not the course of controversy pertaining to the philosophers, Sravakas,  and Pratyekabuddhas; this is "right knowledge." 
 
_1_ <em>Samadharmeti va</em> that follows here is probably to  be dropped on the strength of the Chinese versions. 
 
(<a name="229"><strong>229</strong></a>) These are, Mahamati, the five Dharmas,  and in them are included the three Svabhavas, the eight Vijnanas, the  twofold egolessness, and all the Buddha-truths. In this, Mahamati,  reflect well with your own wisdom and let others do [the same] and do  not allow yourself to be led by another. So it is said: 
 
5. The five Dharmas, the Svabhavas, the eight Vijnanas, and the  twofold egolessness—they are all embraced in the Mahayana. 
 
6. Name, appearance, and discrimination [correspond to] the first two  Svabhavas, while right knowledge and suchness are the Parinishpanna.

At that time again, Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said this to  the Blessed One: It is told by the Blessed One in the canonical text the  Tathagatas of the past, present, and future are like the sands of the  river Ganga. Blessed One, is this to be accepted literally? or is there  another distinct meaning? Pray tell me, Blessed One. 
 
The Blessed One said: Mahamati, do not take it in its literal sense;  for, Mahamati, the Buddhas of the three divisions of time are not  measurable by the measurement of the sands of the Ganga. Why? Because an  analogy which is superior to anything of the world and surpasses it  cannot be called an analogy, since there is in it something resembling  and something not resembling. (<a name="230"><strong>230</strong></a>) The  Tathagatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones do not give out such an  analogy that has in it something resembling and something not resembling  and that is superior to the world and surpasses it. But this comparison  is only given out, Mahamati, by myself and the Tathagatas, in which the  Tathagatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones are said to be like the  sands of the river Ganga; the idea is to terrify those ignorant and  simple-minded ones who, tenaciously clinging to the idea of permanency  and impermanency, and giving themselves up to the ways of thinking and  the erroneous views of the philosophers, follow up the wheel of  transmigration. To those who, anxious to escape the intricacies of the  wheel of existence, seek after the excellent state, thinking how this  could be realised, it is told them that the appearance of the Tathagatas  is not like the blooming of the Udumbara flower, because they will  thereby see that the attainment of Buddhahood is not a difficult  undertaking and will pu1 forward their energy. But it is told in the  canonical text that the Tathagatas appear as rarely as the Udumbara  flower, and this is in consideration of those people who are to be led  by me. Mahamati, however, no one has ever seen the Udumbara flower  blooming, nor will anyone; while, Mahamati, the Tathagatas are at  present in the world, they were seen and are to be seen. To say that the  Tathagatas appear as rarely as the Udumbara flower has [really] no  reference to the establishment of the truth itself. When, Mahamati, the  establishment of the truth itself is pointed out, it surpasses beyond  measure anything in the world that can be offered as an analogy to it,  because [the ignorant] are incapable of believing. And thus there is an  unbelief on the part of the ignorant and simple-minded. (<a name="231"><strong>231</strong></a>)  There is indeed no room for analogies to enter in the realm of  self-realisation which is effected by means of noble wisdom. The truth  transcends all the notions that are characteristic of the Citta, Manas,  and Manovijnana. The truth is the Tathagatas, and, therefore, in them  there is nothing describable by analogy. 
 
But, Mahamati, [sometimes] a comparison is made use of; that is to  say, the Tathagatas are said to be like the sands of the river Ganga,  because they are the same and impartial [to all things], because they  are free from imagination and discrimination. For example, Mahamati, the  sands of the river Ganga are tossed about by the fishes, tortoises,  porpoises, crocodiles, buffalos, lions, elephants, etc., but they are  free from imagination and discrimination; for they do not resent,  saying."We are down-trodden," or "We are not." They are  non-discriminative, pure in themselves, separated from defilement. In  the same way, Mahamati, the self-realisation of noble wisdom which has  been attained by the Tathagatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones, is like  the river Ganga, and their powers, psychic faculties, and self-control  are like the sands; and however much they are tossed about by the fishes  of the philosophers, by the ignorant who belong to other schools, they  are not troubled by imaginations and discriminations. Because of their  original vows, the Tathagatas [whose hearts are] filled with all the  happiness of the Samapatti are not troubled by imaginations and  discriminations with regard to beings. Therefore, the Tathagatas, like  the sands of the river Ganga, are free from partiality because of their  being devoid of likes and dislikes. 
 
To illustrate, Mahamati: as the sands of the river Ganga partake of  the character of the earth, the conflagration that will break out at the  end of the Kalpa may burn the earth but does not destroy its  self-nature. Mahamati, the earth is not consumed because of its being  inseparably connected with the element of fire, (<a name="232"><strong>232</strong></a>)  and it is only the ignorant and simple-minded that on account of their  falling into false ideas imagine the earth being consumed by fire. But  as it supplies the material cause to the element fire, it is never  consumed. In the same way, Mahamati, the Dharmakaya of the Tathagatas,  like the sands of the river Ganga, is never destroyed. 
 
To illustrate, Mahamati: the sands of the river Ganga are  immeasurable. In the same way, Mahamati, the rays of light of the  Tathagatas are beyond measure, which arc-emitted by them in all the  Buddha-assemblies in order to bring beings to maturity and arouse them  [to the knowledge of the truth]. 
 
To illustrate, Mahamati: the sands of the river Ganga do not assume  another nature than itself remaining forever the same. In the same way,  Mahamati, the Tathagatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones are neither  evolving nor disappearing in transmigration because in them the cause of  making them come into existence is destroyed. 
 
To illustrate, Mahamati: the sands of the river Ganga are unconcerned  whether they are carried away or whether more is added into them. In  the same way, Mahamati, the knowledge of the Tathagatas which is  exercised for the maturing of beings is neither exhausted nor augmented,  because the Dharma is without a physical body. Mahamati, that which has  a physical body is subject to annihilation, but not that which has no  physical body; and the Dharma is not a physical body. 
 
To illustrate, Mahamati: the sands of the river Ganga, however much  they are compressed for the sake of the ghee and oil, are destitute of  them. In the same way, (<a name="233"><strong>233</strong></a>) Mahamati, the  Tathagatas never abandon their deep concerns_1_ and original  vows and happiness as regards the Dharmadhatu, however hard they are  oppressed with pain for the sake of beings, as long as all beings have  not yet been led into Nirvana by the Tathagatas, who are endowed with a  great compassionate heart. 
 
To illustrate, Mahamati: the sands of the river Ganga are drawn along  with the flow of the stream, but not where there is no water. In the  same way, Mahamati, the Tathagata's teaching in regard to all the  Buddha-truths takes place along the flow of the Nirvana-stream; and for  this reason the Tathagatas are said to be like the sands of the river  Ganga. 
 
_1_ After T'ang. 
 
Mahamati, in <em>tathagata </em> ("thus come") there is no sense of  "going away"; Mahamati, "going away" means destruction. Mahamati, the  primary limit of transmigration is unknown. Not being known, how can I  talk of the sense of "gong away"? The sense of "going away," Mahamati,  is annihilation, and this is not known by the ignorant and  simple-minded. 
 
Mahamati said: If, Blessed One, the primary limit of transmigration  of all beings is unknowable, how is the emancipation of beings knowable? 
 
The Blessed One said: Mahamati, when it is understood that the  objective world is nothing but what is seen of the Mind itself, the  habit-energy of false speculations and erroneous discriminations which  have been going on since beginningless time is removed, and there is a  revulsion [or turning-back] at the basis of discrimination—this is  emancipation, Mahamati, and not annihilation. Therefore, Mahamati, there  cannot be any talk about endlessness. To be endless in limit, Mahamati,  is another name for discrimination. Apart from discriminations (<a name="234"><strong>234</strong></a>) there are no other beings. When all things  external or internal are examined with intelligence, Mahamati, knowing  and known are found to be quiescent. But when it is not recognised that  all things rise from the discrimination of the Mind itself,  discrimination asserts itself. When this is understood discrimination  ceases. So it is said: 
 
7. Those who regard the removers of obstruction [i. e., Buddhas] as  neither destroyed nor departed for ever, like the sands of the Ganga,  see the Tathagata. 
 
8. Like the sands of the Ganga they are devoid of all error: they  flow along the stream and are permanent, and so is the essence [or  nature] of Buddhahood.

At that time again, Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said this to  the Blessed One; Tell me, Blessed One; tell me, Sugata, Tathagata,  Arhat, Fully-Enlightened One, regarding the momentary destruction of all  things and their distinctive signs. Blessed One, what is meant by all  things being momentary? 
 
The Blessed One replied: Then, Mahamati, listen well and reflect well  within yourself; I will tell you. 
 
Certainly, Blessed One; said Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva and  gave ear to the Blessed One. 
 
The Blessed One said this to him: Mahamati, all things, all things we  speak of, and they are good or bad, effect-producing or not  effect-producing, of this world (<a name="235"><strong>235</strong></a>) or of  super-world, faulty or faultless, of evil flowings or the non-flowings,  receptive or non-receptive. In short, Mahamati, the five appropriating_1_ Skandhas have their rise from the habit-energy of the Citta, Manas, and  Manovijnana, they are imagined good or bad. Mahamati, the happiness of  the Samadhi and the attainments [resulting therefrom], which belong to  the wise by reason of their abiding in the happiness of the existing  world, are called the non-outflowing goods. 
 
_1_ All the Skandhas are self-appropriating, or  self-grasping, as long as there is attachment to the notion of an  ego-soul. When that is got rid of, the Skandhas are <em>anasrava</em>, i.  e. not tainted with evil outflows. 
 
Again, Mahamati, by good and bad are meant the eight Vijnanas. What  are the eight? They are the Tathagata-garbha known as the Alayavijnana,  Manas, Manovijnana, and the system of the five Vijnanas as described by  the philosophers. Now, Mahamati, the system of the five Vijnanas is  together with the Manovijnana, and there is an undivided succession and  differentiation of good and bad, and the entire body moves on  continuously and closely bound together; moving on, it comes to an end;  but as it fails to understand that there is nothing in the world but  what is seen of Mind-only, there is the rising of another Vijnana  [-system] following the cessation of the first; and the Manovijnana in  union with the system of the five Vijnanas, perceiving the difference of  forms and figures, is set in motion, not remaining still even for a  moment—this I call momentariness. Mahamati, momentary is the  Alayavijnana known as the Tathagata-garbha, which is together with the  Manas and with the habit-energy of the evolving Vijnanas— this is  momentary. But [the Alayavijnana which is together] with the  habit-energy of the non-outflows (<em>anasrava</em>) (<a name="236"><strong>236</strong></a>)  is not momentary. This is not understood by the ignorant and  simple-minded who are addicted to the doctrine of momentariness. Not  understanding the momentariness and non-momentariness of all things,  they cherish nihilism whereby they even try to destroy the unmade (<em>asamskrita</em>).  Mahamati, the system itself of the five Vijnanas is not subject to  transmigration, nor does it suffer pleasure and pain, nor is it  conducive to Nirvana. But, Mahamati, the Tathagata-garbha is together  with the cause that suffers pleasure and pain; it is this that is set in  motion and ceases to work; it is stupefied by the fourfold  habit-energy. But the ignorant do not understand it, as their thoughts  are infused with the habit-energy of discrimination which cherishes the  view of momentariness. 
 
Further, Mahamati, gold, vajra, and the relics of the Buddha, owing  to their specific character, are never destroyed but remain the same  until the end of time. If, Mahamati, the nature of enlightenment is  momentary, the wise would lose their wiseness (<em>aryatva</em>), but they  have never lost it. Mahamati, gold and vajra remain the same until the  end of time; remaining the same they are neither diminished nor  increased. How is it that the ignorant, failing to recognise the hidden  meaning of all things internal and external, discriminate in the sense  of momentariness? 
 
<a name="LXXXVII">

Further, Mahamati said: It is again said by the Blessed One that by  fulfilling the six Paramitas Buddhahood is realised. What are the six (<a name="237"><strong>237</strong></a>) Paramitas? And how are they fulfilled? 
 
The Blessed One replied: Mahamati, there are three kinds of  Paramitas. What are the three? They are the worldly, the super-worldly,  and the highest super-wordly. Of these, Mahamati, the worldly Paramitas  [are practised thus]: Adhering tenaciously to the notion of an ego-soul  and what belongs to it and holding fast to dualism, those who are  desirous for this world of form, etc., will practise the Paramita of  charity in order to obtain the various realms of existence. In the same  way, Mahamati, the ignorant will practise the Paramitas of morality,  patience, energy, Dhyana, and Prajna. Attaining the psychic powers they  will be born in Brahma's heaven. 
 
As to the super-worldly Paramitas, they are practised by the Sravakas  and Pratyekabuddhas whose thoughts are possessed by the notion of  Nirvana; the Paramitas of charity, etc. are thus performed by them, who,  like the ignorant, are desirous of enjoying Nirvana for themselves. 
 
Again, Mahamati, as to the highest super-worldly Paramitas, [they are  practised] by the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas who are the practisers of the  highest form of spiritual discipline; that is, perceiving that there is  nothing in the world but what is only seen of the Mind itself, on  account of discrimination, and understanding that duality is of the Mind  itself, they see that discrimination ceases to function; and, that  seizing and holding is non-existent; and, free from all thoughts of  attachment to individual objects which are of the Mind itself, and in  order to benefit and give happiness to all sentient beings, [the  Bodhisattvas] practise the Paramita of charity. While dealing with an  objective world there is no rising in them of discrimination; they just  practise morality and this is the Paramita [of morality]. To practise  patience with no thought of discrimination rising in them (<a name="238"><strong>238</strong></a>)  and yet with full knowledge of grasped and grasping —this is the  Paramita of patience. To exert oneself with energy from the first part  of the night to its end and in conformity with the disciplinary measures  and not to give rise to discrimination—this is the Paramita of energy.  Not to cherish discrimination, not to fall into the philosopher's notion  of Nirvana—this is the Paramita of Dhyana. As to the Paramita of  Prajna: when the discrimination of the Mind itself ceases, when things  are thoroughly examined by means of intelligence, there is no falling  into dualism, and a revulsion takes place at the basis, while previous  karma is not destroyed; when [transcendental knowledge] is exercised for  the accomplishment of self-realisation, then there is the Paramita of  Prajna. These, Mahamati, are the Paramitas and their meanings.

So it is said: 
 
9. The created (<em>Samskrita</em>) are empty, impermanent,  momentary—so the ignorant discriminate; the meaning of momentariness is  discriminated by means of the analogies of a river, a lamp, and seeds. 
 
10. All things are non-existent, they are not-momentary, quiescent,  not subject to destruction, and unborn— this, I say, is the meaning of  momentariness. 
 
11. Birth and death succeed without interruption— this I do not point  out for the ignorant. Owing to the uninterrupted succession of  existence, discrimination moves on in the [six] paths. 
 
12. Ignorance is the cause and there is the general rising of -minds,  when form is not yet born, where is the abode of the middle existence? 
 
13. If another mind is set in motion in an uninterrupted succession  of deaths, (<a name="239"><strong>239</strong></a>) where does it find its  dependence as form is not established in time? 
 
14. If mind is set in motion, somewhere, somehow, the cause is an  unreal one; it is not complete; how can one know of its momentary  disappearances? 
 
15. The attainment of the Yogins, gold, the Buddha-relics, and the  heavenly palace of Abhasvara are indestructible by any worldly agencies. 
 
16. Ever abiding are the truths attained by the Buddhas and their  perfect knowledge; the nature of Buddhahood as realised [by them]—how  can there be momentariness in them? 
 
17. The city of the Gandharvas, Maya-like forms—how can they be  otherwise than momentary? Realities are characterised with unreality,  and how can they be causal agencies?

</a> 
 
(<a name="240"><strong>240</strong></a>) At that time again, Mahamati the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said this to the Blessed One: [How was it that]  the Arhats were given assurance by the Blessed One of their attainment  of supreme enlightenment? [How can] all beings attain Tathagatahood  without realising the truths of Parinirvana? [What does it mean that]  from the night when the Tathagata was awakened to supreme enlightenment  until the night when he entered into Parinirvana, between these times  the Tathagata has not uttered, has not pronounced, a word. [What is the  meaning of this] that being always in Samadhi the Tathagatas neither  deliberate nor contemplate? [How do] Buddhas of transformation, being in  the state of transformation, execute the works of the Tathagatas? How  is the succession of momentary decomposition explained which takes place  in the Vijnanas? 
 
[Further, what do these statements mean] that Vajrapani is constantly  with [the Tathagata] as his personal guard; that the primary limit is  unknown and yet cessation is knowable; that there are evil ones, their  activities, and left-over karma? Blessed One, [facts of] karma-hindrance  are said to be shown [by the Tathagata in the incident of] Canca the  daughter of a Brahmin, of Sundari the daughter of a mendicant, an empty  bowl, etc.; how can the Blessed One with these unexhausted evils attain  all-knowledge? 
 
The Blessed One replied: Then, Mahamati, listen well and reflect well  within yourself; I will tell you. 
 
Certainly, Blessed One; (<a name="241"><strong>241</strong></a>) said Mahamati  the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva and gave ear to the Blessed One. 
 
The Blessed One said this to him: The realm of Nirvana where no  substratum is left behind is according to the hidden meaning and for the  sake of the practisers who are thereby inspired to exert themselves in  the work of the Bodhisattvas. Mahamati, there are Bodhisattvas  practising the work of the Bodhisattva here and in other Buddha-lands,  who, however, are desirous of attaining the Nirvana of the Sravakayana.  In order to turn their inclination away from the Sravakayana and to make  them exert themselves in the course of the Mahayana, the Sravakas in  transformation are given assurance [as to their future Buddhahood] by  the Body of Transformation; but this is not done by the Dharmata-Buddha.  This giving assurance to the Sravakas, Mahamati, is declared according  to the hidden meaning. Mahamati, that the abandonment of  passion-hindrance by the Sravakas and Pratyekabuddhas is not different  [from that by the Tathagatas] is due to the sameness of the taste of  emancipation, but this does not apply to the abandonment of  knowledge-hindrance. Knowledge-hindrance, Mahamati, is purified when the  egolessness of things is distinctly perceived; but passion-hindrance is  destroyed when first the egolessness of persons is perceived and acted  upon, for [then] the Manovijnana ceases to function. Further,  dharma-hindrance is given up because of the disappearance of the  habit-energy [accumulated in] the Alayavijnana, it is now thoroughly  purified. 
 
There is an eternally-abiding reality [which is to be understood]  according to the hidden meaning, because it is something that has  neither antecedents nor consequents. The Tathagata points out the Dharma  without deliberation, without contemplation, and by means of such words  that are original and independent. Because of his right thinking and  because of his unfailing memory, he neither deliberates nor  contemplates, he is no more at the stage of the fourfold habit-energy, (<a name="242"><strong>242</strong></a>) he is free from the twofold death, he has  relinquished the twofold hindrance of passion and knowledge. 
 
Mahamati, the seven Vijnanas, that is, Manas, Manovijnana,,  eye-vijnana, etc., are characterised with momentariness because they  originate from habit-energy, they are destitute of the good non-flowing  factors, and are not transmigratory. What transmigrates, Mahamati, is  the Tathagata-garbha which is the cause of Nirvana as well as that of  pleasure and pain. This is not understood by the ignorant whose minds  are torn asunder by the notion of emptiness. 
 
Mahamati, the Tathagatas who are accompanied by Vajrapani are the  Tathagatas transformed in transformation and are not the original  Tathagatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones. The original Tathagatas,  Mahamati, are indeed beyond all sense and measurement, beyond the reach  of all ignorant ones, Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and philosophers.  [These Tathagatas] are abiding in the joy of existence as it is, as they  have reached the truth of intuitive knowledge by means of Jnanakshanti.  Thus Vajrapani is not attached to them. All the Buddhas of  Transformation do not owe their existence to karma; in them there is no  Tathagatahood, but apart from them there is no Tathagatahood either.  Like the potter who is dependent on various combinations, [the Buddha of  Transformation] does his work for sentient beings; he teaches the  doctrine meeting conditions, but not the doctrine that will establish  the truth as it is, which belongs to the noble realm of  self-realisation. 
 
Further, Mahamati, on account of the cessation of the six Vijnanas  the ignorant and simple-minded look for nihilism, and on account of  their not understanding the Alayavijnana they have eternalism. The  primary limit of the discrimination of their own minds (<a name="243"><strong>243</strong></a>)  is unknown, Mahamati. Emancipation is obtained when this discrimination  of Mind itself ceases. With the abandonment of the fourfold  habit-energy the abandonment of all faults takes place. 
 
So it is said:_1_ 
 
1. The three vehicles are no-vehicle; there is no Nirvana with the  Buddhas; it is pointed out that the assurance of Buddhahood is given to  all that are freed from faults. 
 
2. Ultimate intuitive knowledge, Nirvana that leaves no remnant,  —this is told according to the hidden meaning in order to give  encouragement to the timid. 
 
_1_The following gathas do not seem to have any specific  relation to the prose section. 
 
3. Knowledge is produced by the Buddhas, and the path is pointed out  by them: they move in it and not in anything else, therefore there is no  Nirvana with them. 
 
4. Existence, desire, form (<em>rupa</em>), theorising—this is the  fourfold habit-energy; this is where the Manovijnana takes its rise and  the Alaya and Manas abide. 
 
5. Nihilism and the idea of impermanency rise because of the  Manovijnana, the eye-vijnana, etc.; eternalism rises from [the thought  that] there is no beginning in Nirvana, intelligence, and theorisation. 
 
Here Ends the Seventh Chapter, "On Transformation." 
 
<a name="chap8"> 
 
## [CHAPTER EIGHT] 
 
</a> 
 
(<a name="244"><strong>244</strong></a>) At that time Mahamati the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva asked the Blessed One in verse and again made a  request, saying: Pray tell me, Blessed One, Tathagata, Arhat,  Fully-Enlightened One regarding the merit and vice of meat-eating;  thereby I and other Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas of the present and future  may teach the Dharma to make those beings abandon their greed for meat,  who, under the influence of the habit-energy belonging to the  carnivorous existence, strongly crave meat-food. These meat-eaters thus  abandoning their desire for [its] taste will seek the Dharma for their  food and enjoyment, and, regarding all beings with love as if they were  an only child, will cherish great compassion towards them. Cherishing  [great compassion], they will discipline themselves at the stages of  Bodhisattvahood and will quickly be awakened in supreme enlightenment;  or staying a while at the stage of Sravakahood and Pratyekabuddhahood,  they will finally reach the highest stage of Tathagatahood. 
 
_1_ This chapter on meat-eating is another later addition to  the text, which was probably done earlier than the Ravana chapter. It  already appears in the Sung, but of the three Chinese versions it  appears here in its shortest form, the proportion being S = 1, T = 2, W =  3. It is quite likely that meat-eating was practised more or less among  the earlier Buddhists, which was made a subject of severe criticism by  their opponents. The Buddhists at the time of the <em>Lankavatara</em> did  not like it, hence this addition in which an apologetic tone is  noticeable. 
 
Blessed One, even those philosophers who hold erroneous doctrines and  are addicted to the views of the Lokayata such as the dualism of being  and non-being, nihilism, and eternalism, will prohibit meat-eating and  will themselves refrain from eating it. How much more, O World Leader,  he who promotes one taste for mercy and is the Fully-Enlightened One; (<a name="245"><strong>245</strong></a>) why not prohibit in his teachings the eating  of flesh not only by himself but by others? Indeed, let the Blessed One  who at heart is filled with pity for the entire world, who regards all  beings as his only child, and who possesses great compassion in  compliance with his sympathetic feelings, teach us as to the merit and  vice of meat-eating, so that I and other Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas may  teach the Dharma. 
 
Said the Blessed One: Then, Mahamati, listen well and reflect well  within yourself; I will tell you. 
 
Certainly, Blessed One; said Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva and  gave ear to the Blessed One. 
 
The Blessed One said this to him: For innumerable reasons, Mahamati,  the Bodhisattva, whose nature is compassion, is not to eat any meat; I  will explain them: Mahamati, in this long course of transmigration here,  there is not one living being that, having assumed the form of a living  being, has not been your mother, or father, or brother, or sister, or  son, or daughter, or the one or the other, in various degrees of  kinship; and when acquiring another form of life may live as a beast, as  a domestic animal, as a bird, or as a womb-born, or as something  standing in some relationship to you; [this being so] how can the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva who desires to approach all living beings as if  they were himself and to practise the Buddha-truths, eat the flesh of  any living being that is of the same nature as himself? Even, Mahamati,  the Rakshasa, listening to the Tathagata's discourse on the highest  essence of the Dharma, attained the notion of protecting [Buddhism],  and, feeling pity, (<a name="246"><strong>246</strong></a>) refrains from eating  flesh; how much more those who love the Dharma! Thus, Mahamati, wherever  there is the evolution of living beings, let people cherish the thought  of kinship with them, and, thinking that all beings are [to be loved as  if they were] an only child, let them refrain from eating meat. So with  Bodhisattvas whose nature is compassion, [the eating of] meat is to be  avoided by him. Even in exceptional cases, it is not [compassionate] of a  Bodhisattva of good standing to eat meat. The flesh of a dog, an ass, a  buffalo, a horse, a bull, or man, or any other [being], Mahamati, that  is not generally eaten by people, is sold on the roadside as mutton for  the sake of money; and therefore, Mahamati, the Bodhisattva should not  eat meat. 
 
For the sake of love of purity, Mahamati, the Bodhisattva should  refrain from eating flesh which is born of semen, blood, etc. For fear  of causing terror to living beings, Mahamati, let the Bodhisattva who is  disciplining himself to attain compassion, refrain from eating flesh.  To illustrate, Mahamati: When a dog sees, even from a distance, a  hunter, a pariah, a fisherman, etc., whose desires are for meat-eating,  he is terrified with fear, thinking, "They are death-dealers, they will  even kill me." In the same way, Mahamati, even those minute animals that  are living in the air, on earth, and in water, seeing meat-eaters at a  distance, will perceive in them, by their keen sense of smell, (<a name="247"><strong>247</strong></a>) the odour of the Rakshasa and will run away  from such people as quickly as possible; for they are to them the threat  of death. For this reason, Mahamati, let the Bodhisattva, who is  disciplining himself, to abide in great compassion, because of its  terrifying living beings, refrain from eating meat. Mahamati, meat which  is liked by unwise people is full of bad smell and its eating gives one  a bad reputation which turns wise people away; let the Bodhisattva  refrain from eating meat. The food of the wise, Mahamati, is what is  eaten by the Rishis; it does not consist of meat and blood. Therefore,  Mahamati, let the Bodhisattva refrain from eating meat. 
 
In order to guard the minds of all people, Mahamati, let the  Bodhisattva whose nature is holy and who is desirous of avoiding censure  on the teaching of the Buddha, refrain from eating meat. For instance,  Mahamati, there are some in the world who speak ill of the teaching of  the Buddha; [they would say,] "Why are those who are living the life of a  Sramana or a Brahmin reject such food as was enjoyed by the ancient  Rishis, and like the carnivorous animals, living in the air, on earth,  or in the water? Why do they go wandering about in the world thoroughly  terrifying living beings, disregarding the life of a Sramana and  destroying the vow of a Brahmin? There is no Dharma, no discipline in  them." There are many such adverse-minded people who thus speak ill of  the teaching of the Buddha. For this reason, Mahamati, in order to guard  the minds of all people, (<a name="248"><strong>248</strong></a>) let the  Bodhisattva whose nature is full of pity and who is desirous of avoiding  censure on the teaching of the Buddha, refrain from eating meat. 
 
Mahamati, there is generally an offensive odour to a corpse, which  goes against nature; therefore, let the Bodhisattva refrain from eating  meat. Mahamati, when flesh is burned, whether it be that of a dead man  or of some other living creature, there is no distinction in the odour.  When flesh of either kind is burned, the odour emitted is equally  noxious. Therefore, Mahamati, let the Bodhisattva, who is ever desirous  of purity in his discipline, wholly refrain from eating meat. 
 
Mahamati, when sons or daughters of good family, wishing to exercise  themselves in various disciplines such as the attainment of a  compassionate heart, the holding a magical formula, or the perfecting of  magical knowledge, or starting on a pilgrimage to the Mahayana, retire  into a cemetery, or to a wilderness, or a forest, where demons gather or  frequently approach; or when they attempt to sit on a couch or a seat  for the exercise; they are hindered [because of their meat-eating] from  gaining magical powers or from obtaining emancipation. Mahamati, seeing  that thus there are obstacles to the accomplishing of all the practices,  let the Bodhisattva, who is desirous of benefiting himself as well as  others, wholly refrain from eating meat. 
 
As even the sight of objective forms gives rise to the desire for  tasting their delicious flavour, let the Bodhisattva, whose nature is  pity and who regards all beings as his only child, wholly refrain from  eating meat. (<a name="249"><strong>249</strong></a>) Recognising that his mouth  smells most obnoxiously, even while living this life, let the  Bodhisattva whose nature is pity, wholly refrain from eating meat. 
 
[The meat-eater] sleeps uneasily and when awakened is distressed. He  dreams of dreadful events, which makes his hair rise on end. He is left  alone in an empty hut; he leads a solitary life; and his spirit is  seized by demons. Frequently he is struck with terror, he trembles  without knowing why, there is no regularity in his eating, he is never  satisfied. In his eating_1_ he never knows what is meant by  proper taste, digestion, and nourishment. His visceras are filled with  worms and other impure creatures and harbour the cause of leprosy. He  ceases to entertain any thoughts of aversion towards all diseases. When I  teach to regard food as if it were eating the flesh of one's own child,  or taking a drug, how can I permit my disciples, Mahamati, to eat food  consisting of flesh and blood, which is gratifying to the unwise but is  abhorred by the wise, which brings many evils and keeps away many  merits; and which was not offered to the Rishis and is altogether  unsuitable? 
 
_1_ Delete <em>pitakhadita</em> (line 7). 
 
Now, Mahamati, the food I have permitted [my disciples to take] is  gratifying to all wise people but is avoided by the unwise; it is  productive of many merits, it keeps away many evils; and it has been  prescribed by the ancient Rishis. (<a name="250"><strong>250</strong></a>) It  comprises rice, barley, wheat, kidney beans, beans, lentils, etc.,  clarified butter, oil, honey, molasses, treacle, sugar cane, coarse  sugar, etc.; food prepared with these is proper food. Mahamati, there  may be some irrational people in the future who will discriminate and  establish new rules of moral discipline, and who, under the influence of  the habit-energy belonging to the carnivorous races, will greedily  desire the taste [of meat]: it is not for these people that the above  food is prescribed. Mahamati, this is the food I urge for the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas who have made offerings to the previous Buddhas,  who have planted roots of goodness, who are possessed of faith, devoid  of discrimination, who are all men and women belonging to the Sakya  family, who are sons and daughters of good family, who have no  attachment to body, life, and property, who do not covet delicacies, are  not at all greedy, who being compassionate desire to embrace all living  beings as their own person, and who regard all beings with affection as  if they were an only child. 
 
Long ago in the past, Mahamati, there lived a king whose name was  Simhasaudasa. His excessive fondness for meat, his greed to be served  with it, (<a name="251"><strong>251</strong></a>) stimulated his taste for it to  the highest degree so that he [even] ate human flesh. In consequence of  this he was alienated from the society of his friends, counsellors,  kinsmen, relatives, not to speak of his townsmen and countrymen. In  consequence he had to renounce his throne and dominion and to suffer  great calamities because of his passion for meat. 
 
Mahamati, even Indra who obtained sovereignty over the gods had once  to assume the form of a hawk owing to his habit-energy of eating meat  for food in a previous existence; he then chased Visvakarma appearing in  the guise of a pigeon, who had thus to place himself on the scale. King  Sivi feeling pity for the innocent [pigeon had to sacrifice himself to  the hawk and thus] to suffer great pain. Even a god who became Indra the  Powerful, after going through many a birth, Mahamati, is liable to  bring misfortune both upon himself and others; how much more those who  are not Indra! 
 
Mahamati, there was another king_1_ who was carried away by  his horse into a forest. After wandering about in it, he committed evil  deeds with a lioness out of fear for his life, and children were born to  her. Because of their descending from the union with a lioness, (<a name="252"><strong>252</strong></a>) the royal children were called the  Spotted-Feet, etc. On account of their evil habit-energy in the past  when their food had been flesh, they ate meat even [after becoming]  king, and, Mahamati, in this life they lived in a village called  Kutiraka ("seven huts"), and because they were excessively attached and  devoted to meat-eating they gave birth to Dakas and Dakinis who were  terrible eaters of human flesh. In the life of transmigration, Mahamati,  such ones will fall into the wombs of such excessive flesh-devouring  creatures as the lion, tiger, panther, wolf, hyena, wild-cat, jackal,  owl, etc.; they will fall into the wombs of still more greedily  flesh-devouring and still more terrible Rakshasas. Falling into such, it  will be with difficulty that they can ever obtain a human womb; how  much more [difficult] attaining Nirvana! 
 
<div>_1_ The text has all this in the plural.</div> 
 
Such as these, Mahamati, are the evils of meat-eating; how much more  numerous [evil] qualities that are born of the perverted minds of those  devoted to [meat-eating]_1_. And, Mahamati, the ignorant and  simple-minded are not aware of all this and other evils and merits [in  connection with meat-eating]. I tell you, Mahamati, that seeing these  evils and merits the Bodhisattva whose nature is pity should eat no  meat. 
 
If, Mahamati, meat is not eaten by anybody for any reason, there will  be no destroyer of life. Mahamati, in the majority of cases (<a name="253"><strong>253</strong></a>) the slaughtering of innocent living beings is  done for pride and very rarely for other causes. Though nothing special  may be said of eating the flesh of living creatures such as animals and  birds, alas, Mahamati, that one addicted to the love of [meat-] taste  should eat human flesh! Mahamati, in most cases nets and other devices  are prepared in various places by people who have lost their sense on  account of their appetite for meat-taste, and thereby many innocent  victims are destroyed for the sake of the price [they bring in]—such as  birds, Kaurabhraka, Kaivarta, etc., that are moving about in the air, on  land, and in water. There are even some, Mahamati, who are like  Rakshasas hard-hearted and used to practising cruelties, _2 _who,  being so devoid of compassion, would now and then look at living beings  as meant for food and destruction— no compassion is awakened in them. 
 
_1_ Both T'ang and Wei have here a sentence to the following  effect: "Those who do not eat meat acquire a large sum of merit." 
 
_2_ According to T'ang. 
 
It is not true, Mahamati, that meat is proper food and permissible  for the Sravaka when [the victim] was not killed by himself, when he did  not order others to kill it, when it was not specially meant for him.  Again, Mahamati, there may be some unwitted people in the future time,  who, beginning to lead the homeless life according to my teaching, are  acknowledged as sons of the Sakya, and carry the Kashaya robe about them  as a badge, but who are in thought evilly affected by erroneous  reasonings. They may talk about various discriminations which they make  in their moral discipline, being addicted to the view of a personal  soul. Being under the influence of the thirst for [meat-] taste, they  will string together in various ways (<a name="254"><strong>254</strong></a>) some  sophistic arguments to defend meat-eating. They think they are giving  me an unprecedented calumny when they discriminate and talk about facts  that are capable of various interpretations. Imagining that this fact  allows this interpretation, [they conclude that] the Blessed One permits  meat as proper food, and that it is mentioned among permitted foods and  that probably the Tathagata himself partook of it. But, Mahamati,  nowhere in the sutras is meat permitted as something enjoyable, nor it  is referred to as proper among the foods prescribed [for the Buddha's  followers]. 
 
If however, Mahamati, I had the mind to permit [meat-eating], or if I  said it was proper for the Sravakas [to eat meat], I would not have  forbidden, I would not forbid, ail meat-eating for these Yogins, the  sons and daughters of good family, who, wishing to cherish the idea that  all beings are to them like an only child, are possessed of compassion,  practise contemplation, mortification, and are on their way to the  Mahayana. And, Mahamati, the interdiction not to eat any kind of meat is  here given to all sons and daughters of good family, whether they are  cemetery-ascetics of forest-ascetics, or Yogins who are practising the  exercises, if they wish the Dharma and are on the way to the mastery of  any vehicle, and being possessed of compassion, conceive the idea of  regarding all beings as an only child, in order to accomplish the end of  their discipline. 
 
(<a name="255"><strong>255</strong></a>) In the canonical texts here and there  the process of discipline is developed in orderly sequence like a ladder  going up step by step, and one joined to another in a regular and  methodical manner; after explaining each point meat obtained in these  specific circumstances is not interdicted._1_ Further, a  tenfold prohibition is given as regards the flesh of animals found dead  by themselves. But in the present sutra all [meat-eating] in any form,  in any manner, and in any place, is unconditionally and once for all,  prohibited for all. Thus, Mahamati, meat-eating I have not permitted to  anyone, I do not permit, I will not permit. Meat-eating, I tell you,  Mahamati, is not proper for homeless monks. There may be some, Mahamati,  who would say that meat was eaten by the Tathagata thinking this would  calumniate him. Such unwitted people as these, Mahamati, will follow the  evil course of their own karma-hindrance, and will fall into such  regions where long nights are passed without profit and without  happiness. Mahamati, the noble Sravakas do not eat the food taken  properly by [ordinary] men, how much less the food of flesh and blood,  which is altogether improper. Mahamati, the food for my Sravakas,  Pratyekabuddhas, and Bodhisattvas is the Dharma and not flesh_2_-food;  how much more the Tathagata! The Tathagata is the Dharmakaya, Mahamati;  he abides in the Dharma as food; his is not a body feeding on flesh; he  does not abide in any flesh-food. He has ejected the habit-energy of  thirst and desire which sustain all existence; he keeps away the  habit-energy of all evil passions; he is thoroughly emancipated in mind  and knowledge; he is the All-knower; (<a name="256"><strong>256</strong></a>) he  is All-seer; he regards all beings impartially as an only child; he is a  great compassionate heart. Mahamati, having the thought of an only  child for all beings, how can I, such as I am, permit the Sravakas to  eat the flesh of their own child? How much less my eating it! That I  have permitted the Sravakas as well as myself to partake of  [meat-eating], Mahamati, has no foundation whatever. 
 
So it is said: 
 
1. Liquor, meat, and onions are to be avoided, Mahamati, by the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas and those who are Victor-heroes. 
 
_1_ The text as it stands requires fuller explanation. 
 
_2_ <em>Amisra</em> (mixed) in T'ang. 
 
2. Meat is not agreeable to the wise: it has a nauseating odour, it  causes a bad reputation, it is food for the carnivorous; I say_1_ this, Mahamati, it is not to be eaten. 
 
3. To those who eat [meat] there are detrimental effects, to those  who do not, merits; Mahamati, you should know that meat-eaters bring  detrimental effects upon themselves. 
 
4. Let the Yogin refrain from eating flesh as it is born of himself,  as [the eating] involves transgression, as [flesh] is produced of semen  and blood, and as [the killing of animals] causes terror to living  beings. 
 
5. Let the Yogin always refrain from meat, onions, various kinds of  liquor, allium, and garlic. 
 
6. Do not anoint the body with sesamum oil; do not sleep on a bed,  perforated with spikes; (<a name="257"><strong>257</strong></a>) for the living  beings who find their shelter in the cavities and in places where there  are no cavities may be terribly frightened._2_ 
 
7. From eating [meat] arrogance is born, from arrogance erroneous  imaginations issue, and from imagination is born greed; and for this  reason refrain from eating [meat]. 
 
8. From imagination, greed is born, and by greed the mind it  stupefied; there is attachment to stupefaction, and there is no  emancipation from birth [and death]. 
 
9. For profit sentient beings are destroyed, for flesh money is paid  out, they are both evil-doers and [the deed] matures in the hells called  Raurava (screaming), etc. 
 
10. One who eats flesh, trespassing against the words of the Muni, is  evil-minded; he is pointed out in the teachings of the Sakya as the  destroyer of the welfare of the two worlds. 
 
11. Those evil-doers go to the most horrifying hell; meat-eaters are  matured in the terrific hells such as Raurava, etc. 
 
12. There is no meat to be regarded as pure in three ways: not  premeditated, not asked for, and not impelled; therefore, refrain from  eating meat. 
 
_1_ <em>Brumi</em>, instead of <em>bruhi</em> as in the text. 
 
_2_ Unintelligible as far as the translator can see. 
 
13. Let not the Yogin eat meat, it is forbidden by myself as well as  by the Buddhas; those sentient beings who feed on one another will be  reborn among the carnivorous animals. 
 
14. [The meat-eater] is ill-smelling, contemptuous, and born deprived  of intelligence; (<a name="258"><strong>258</strong></a>) he will be born again  and again among the families of the Candala, the Pukkasa, and the Domba. 
 
15. From the womb of Dakini he will be born in the meat-eaters'  family, and then into the womb of a Rakshasi and a cat; he belongs to  the lowest class of men. 
 
16. Meat-eating is rejected by me in such sutras as the <em>Hastikakshya,</em> the <em>Mahamegha,</em> the <em>Nirvana</em>, the <em>Anglimalika</em>, and  the <em>Lankavatara</em>. 
 
17. [Meat-eating] is condemned by the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and  Sravakas; if one devours [meat] out of shamelessness he will always be  devoid of sense. 
 
18. One who avoids meat, etc., will be born, because of this fact, in  the family of the Brahmins or of the Yogins, endowed with knowledge and  wealth. 
 
19. Let one avoid all meat-eating [whatever they may say about]  witnessing, hearing, and suspecting; these theorisers born in a  carnivorous family understand this not. 
 
20. As greed is the hindrance to emancipation, so are meat-eating,  liquor, etc., hindrances. 
 
21. There may be in time to come people who make foolish remarks  about meat-eating, saying, "Meat is proper to eat, unobjectionable, and  permitted by the Buddha." 
 
22. Meat-eating is a medicine; again, it is like a child's flesh; (<a name="259"><strong>259</strong></a>) follow the proper measure and be averse [to  meat, and thus] let the Yogin go about begging. 
 
23. [Meat-eating] is forbidden by me everywhere and all the time for  those who are abiding in compassion; [he who eats meat] will be born in  the same place as the lion, tiger, wolf, etc. 
 
24. Therefore, do not eat meat which will cause terror among people,  because it hinders the truth of emancipation; [not to eat meat—] this is  the mark of the wise. 
 
Here Ends the Eighth Chapter, "On Meat-eating," from the <em>Lankavatara,</em> the Essence of the Teaching of All the Buddhas._1_ 
 
_1_ For the phrase "The essence of the teaching of the  Buddhas (<em>sarvabuddhapravacanahridaya</em>)," see <a href="http://lirs.ru/do/lanka_eng/lanka-chapter-2.htm#IX">pp. 39-40</a>.

</a> 
 
(<a name="260"><strong>260</strong></a>) At that time the Blessed One addressed  Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva: Mahamati, you should hold forth  these magical phrases of the <em>Lankavatara,</em> which were recited, are  recited, and will be recited by the Buddhas of the past, present, and  future. I will recite them here for the benefit of the proclaimers of  the Dharma, who will retain them in memory. They are: 
 
Tutte, tutte—vutte, vutte—patte, patte—katte, katte—amale,  amale—vimale, vimale—nime, nime—hime, hime—vame, vame—kale, kale, kale,  kale—atte, matte—vatte, tutte—jnette, sputte—katte, katte—latte,  patte—dime dime—cale, cale—pace, pace—badhe, bandhe—ance, mance—dutare,  dutare—patare, patare—arkke, arkke—sarkke, sarkke—cakre, cakre—dime,  dime—hime, hime—tu tu tu tu (4)—du du du du (4)—ru ru ru ru (4)—phu phu  phu phu (4)—svaha. 
 
_1_ Another later addition probably when Dharani was  extensively taken into the body of Buddhist literature just before its  disappearance from the land of its birth. Dharani is a study by itself.  In India where all kinds of what may be termed abnormalities in  religious symbology are profusely thriving, Dharani has also attained a  high degree of development as in the case of Mudra (holding the  fingers), Asana (sitting), and Kalpa (mystic rite). When a religious  symbolism takes a start in a certain direction, it pursues its own  course regardless of its original meaning, and the symbolism itself  begins to gain a new signification which has never been thought of  before in connection with the original idea. The mystery of an  articulate sound which infinitely fascinated the imagination of the  primitive man has come to create a string of meaningless sounds in the  form of a Dharani. Its recitation is now considered by its followers to  produce mysterious effects in various ways in life. 
 
(<a name="261"><strong>261</strong></a>) These, Mahamati, are the magical  phrases of the <em>Lankavatara Mahayana Sutra</em>: If sons and daughters  of good family should hold forth, retain, proclaim, realise these  magical phrases, no one should ever be able to effect his descent upon  them. Whether it be a god, or a goddess, or a Naga, or a Nagi, or a  Yaksha, or a Yakshi, or an Asura, or an Asuri, or a Garuda, or a Garudi,  or a Kinnara, or a Kannari, or a Mahoraga, or a Mahoragi, or a  Gandharva, or a Gandharvi, or a Bhuta, or a Bhuti, or a Kumbhanda, or a  Kumbhandi, or a Pisara, or a Pisaci, or an Austaraka, or an Austaraki,  or a Apasmara, or an Apasmari, or a Rakshasa, or a Rakshasi, or a Daka,  or a Dakini, or an Aujohara, or an Aujohari, or a Kataputana, or a  Kataputani, or an Amanushya, or an Amanushyi, —no one of these will be  able to effect his or her descent [upon the holder of these magical  phrases]. If any misfortune should befall, let him recite the magical  phrases for one hundred and eight times, and [the evil ones] will,  wailing and crying, turn away and go in another direction. 
 
I will tell you, Mahamati, other magical phrases. They are: 
 
Padme, padmadeve—hine, hini, hine—cu, cule, culu, cule (<a name="262"><strong>262</strong></a>)—phale,  phula, phule—yule, ghule, yula, yule—ghule, ghula, ghule—pale, pala,  pale—munce, munce, munce—cchinde, bhinde, bhanje, marde, pramarde,  dinakare—svaha. 
 
If, Mahamati, any son or daughter of good family should hold forth,  retain, proclaim, and realise these magical phrases, on him or her no  [evil beings] should be able to make their descent. Whether it be a god,  or a goddess, or a Naga, or a Nagi, or a Yaksha, or a Yakshi, or an  Asura, or an Asuri, a Garuda, or a Garudi, or a Kinnara, or a Kinnari,  or a Mahoraga, or a Mahoragi, or a Gandharva, or a Gandharvi, or a  Bhuta, or a Bhuti, or a Kumbhanda, or a Kumbhandi, or a Pisaca, or a  Pisaci, or an Austaraka, or an Austaraki, or an Apasmara, or an  Apasmari, or a Rakshasa, or a Rakshasi, or a Daka, or a Dakini, or an  Aujohara, or an Aujohari, or a Kataputana, or a Kataputani, or an  Amanushya, or an Amanushyi—no one of these will be able to effect his or  her descent upon [the holder of these magical phrases]. By him who will  recite these magic phrases, the [whole] <em>Lankavatara Sutra</em> will  be recited. (<a name="263"><strong>263</strong></a>) These magic phrases are given  by the Blessed One to guard against the interference of the Rakshasas. 
 
Here Ends the Ninth Chapter Called "Dharani" in the <em>Lankavatara</em>.

At that time Mahamati the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva said this to the  Blessed One:_2_ 
 
1. (Chapter II, verse 1.) 
 
2. (Chapter II, verse 3.) 
 
3. (Chapter II, verse 2.) 
 
4, 5. (Chapter II, verses 6, 7.) 
 
(<a name="265"><strong>265</strong></a>) 6. (Chapter II, verse 8.)_3 _ 
 
7, 8. (Chapter II, verses 151, 152.) 
 
9. (Chapter II, verse 178.) 
 
_1_ This section entitled, "Sagathakam," consists entirely  of verses. It is probable that it was added later into the text. The  subjects treated are many and varied, including those that have never  appeared in the text. The verses are in a most confused condition, and  it is frequently quite difficult to disentangle them and give them a  semblance of order. The reader may use his own judgment in the matter. 
 
_2_ This remark refers only to the first six verses. The  Chinese translations have here the following: "At that time the Blessed  One wishing to declare again the deep signification of the Sutra uttered  the following verses." The verses enumerated in the Sanskrit text are  884, out of which about 208 are repetitions of those which have already  appeared in the main text. These repetitions are systematically excluded  in T'ang, while Wei, with a few exceptions, repeats them all. In this  English translation I have followed the method of T'ang. When we know  more about the historical circumstances of the compilation of the  various sutras we may be able to see how these repetitions came to be  inserted here and also may learn something regarding the relation which  this "Sagathakam" section stands to the preceding part of the Sutra. 
 
_3_ These verses are not repeated in the same order as they  are in the prose section of the text. There are some omissions, too.  These irregularities take place throughout the "Sagathakam, " showing  that the verses were originally an independent body. 
 
10.  These individual objects are not solid [realities]; they rise  because of imagination; as the imagination itself is empty, what is  imagined is empty. 
 
11. (Chapter II, verse 149.) 
 
12. (Chapter II, verse 154.) 
 
13. By wrong discrimination the Vijnana[-system] rises; severally as  eightfold, as ninefold,_1_ like waves on the great ocean. 
 
14. The root is constantly nourished by habit-energy, firmly attached  to the seat; (<a name="266"><strong>266</strong></a>) the mind moves along with  an objective world as iron is drawn by the loadstone. 
 
15. The original source on which all sentient beings are dependent is  beyond theorisation; all doings cease and emancipation obtains, knowing  and known are transcended. 
 
16. In the Samadhi known as Maya-like, one goes beyond the ten stages  of Bodhisattvaship; one who is removed from thought and knowledge  perceives the Mind-king. 
 
17. When a "turning-back" takes place in the mind, one abides  permanently in the palace of lotus-form, which is born of the realm of  Maya. 
 
18. Abiding in it one attains a life of imagelessness, and, like a  many-coloured jewel, performs religious deeds for all beings. 
 
19. Except for discrimination, there is neither Samskrita (or things  made) nor Asamskrita (or things not made); the ignorant hold on to them  as a barren woman does to the child of her dream; what fools they are! 
 
20. Let it be known that without self-nature, unborn, and empty are a  personal soul, the Skandha-continuity, causation, the Dhatus, and [the  notion of] existence and non-existence. 
 
21. To me teaching is an expedient, but I do not teach external  signs; the ignorant because of their attachment to existence seize on  signified and signifying. 
 
22. A knower of all things is not an all-knower, and all is not  within all; the ignorant discriminate and [think] "I am the enlightened  one in the world"; but I am not enlightened nor do I enlighten others. 
 
_1_ This requires attention. The Sutra itself maintains a  system of eight Vijnanas, and not a ninefold one, which is a later  development.

27. These things are empty, without self-nature, and unborn, like  Maya, like a dream, and their being and non-being is unobtainable. 
 
28. One self-nature <em>(svabhava) </em> I teach, which is removed from  speculation and thought-construction, which belongs to the exquisite  [spiritual] realm of the wise, removed from the two Svabhavas [i. e.,  the Parikalpita and the Paratantra]. 
 
(<a name="268"><strong>268</strong></a>) 29. Though multitudinousness of things  has no [real] existence as such, they appear to the intoxicated as like  fire-flies because of their constitutional disturbance; likewise is the  world essentially [appearance]. 
 
30. As Maya is manifested depending on grass, wood, and brick, though  Maya itself is non-existent, so are all things essentially [mere  appearances]. 
 
31. There is neither seizing nor seized, neither bound nor binding;  all is like Maya, like a mirage, like a dream, like an affected eye. 
 
32. When the truth-seeker sees [the truth] devoid of discrimination  and free from impurities, then he is accomplished in his contemplation;  he sees me, there is no doubt. 
 
33. In this there is nothing of thought construction; it is like a  mirage in the air; those who thus see all things, see nothing whatever._2_ 
 
34. In causation which governs being and non-being things do not  originate; in the triple world the mind is perturbed, therefore  multiplicities appear. 
 
_1_ Omit the line in parentheses. 
 
_2_ This verse and the following one do not appear in T'ang,  and they are also missing in the prose section. 
 
35. The world is the same as a dream, and so are the multiplicities  of things in it; [the wise] see property, touch, death, a world-teacher,  and work as of the same nature._1_ 
 
36. This mind is the source of the triple world; when the mind goes  astray there appears this world and that; (<a name="269"><strong>269</strong></a>)  recognising the world as such, as it is non-existent, [a wise man] does  not discriminate a world. 
 
37. The ignorant because of their stupidity see [an objective world]  as taking its rise and disappearing, but he who has transcendental  knowledge sees it neither rising nor disappearing. 
 
38. Those who are always above discrimination, in conformity with  truth, and removed from mind and its belongings, are in the celestial  palace of Akanishtha where all evils are discarded. 
 
39. Such attain the powers, psychic faculties, and self-control, are  thoroughly adept in the Samadhis, and are there [in the heaven] awakened  to enlightenment; but the transformed ones are awakened here [on  earth]. 
 
40. The Buddhas appear on earth in their innumerable  transformation-bodies beyond calculation, and everywhere the ignorant  following them listen to the Dharma. 
 
41. [There is one thing which is] released from [such conditions of  existence as] beginning, middle, and ending, removed from existence and  non-existence, all-pervading, immovable, pure, and above multiplicity,  and [yet] producing multiplicity. 
 
42. There is an essence_2_ entirely covered by  thought-constructions and hidden inside all that has body; because of  perversion there is Maya; Maya, [however], is not the cause of  perversion. 
 
43. Even because of the mind being deluded, there is a somewhat  [perceived as real]; being bound up with the two Svabhavas there is the  transformation of the Alayavijnana. 
 
_1_ For the last quarter Wei has: "The honoured one of the  world preaches these doings." T'ang: "The person who perceives this well  will be honoured by the world." 
 
_2_ <em>Gotra</em> (眞性) according to T'ang. 
 
(<a name="270"><strong>270</strong></a>) 44. The world is no more than  thought-construction, and there rages an ocean of views as regards ego  and things (<em>dharma</em>); when the world is clearly perceived as such  and there takes place a revulsion_1_ [in the mind], this [one]  is my child who is devoted to the truth of perfect knowledge. 
 
45. Things are discriminated by the ignorant as heat, fluidity,  motility, and solidity; they are, however, unrealities asserted; there  is neither signified nor signifying. 
 
46. But this body, form (<em>samsthana</em>) and senses are made of the  eight substances; deluded in the cage of transmigration, the ignorant  thus discriminate this phenomenal world (<em>rupa</em>). 
 
47. In the intermingling of causes and conditions, the ignorant  imagine the birth [of all things]; but as they do not understand the  truth, they go astray in this abode of the triple world. 
 
48. (Chapter II, verse 146.) 
 
(<a name="271"><strong>271</strong></a>) 49. What is known as  multiplicity-seeds multiply in the mind (<em>citta</em>); in what is  revealed, the ignorant imagine birth and are delighted with dualism. 
 
50. Ignorance, desire, and karma—they are the causes of mind and its  belongings;_2_ as they evolve thus [relatively], they are  [recognised] by me to be Paratantric. 
 
51. When the field of mentation gets confused, they imagine that  there is something [real] to take hold of; in this imagination there is  no perfect knowledge, it is false imagination rising from delusion. 
 
52. When bound in conditions there evolves a mind in all beings; when  released from conditions, I say, I see no [mind rising]. 
 
53. When the mind, released from conditions and unsupported by  thought of self, abides no longer in the body, to me there is no  objective world. 
 
54 and 55. (Chapter II, verses 147 and 148.)

(<a name="272"><strong>272</strong></a>) 57. So the flood of the Alayavijnana  is always stirred by the winds of objectivity (<em>vishaya</em>), and goes  on dancing with the various Vijnana-waves. 
 
58. Because there is that which is seized and that which seizes, mind  rises in all beings; there are no such signs visible [in the world] as  are imagined by the ignorant. 
 
59. There is the highest Alayavijnana, and again there is the Alaya  as thought-construction (<em>vijnapti</em>); I teach suchness (<em>tathata</em>)  that is above seized and seizing. 
 
60. Neither an ego, nor a being, nor a person exists in the Skandhas;  [there is birth when] the Vijnana is born, and [cessation when] the  Vijnana ceases. 
 
61. As a picture shows highness and lowness while [in reality] there  is nothing of the sort in it; so in things existent there is thingness  seen [as real] while there is nothing of the sort in them. 
 
62. The visible world (<em>drisyam</em>) has always the appearance of  the city of the Gandharvas and that of fata morgana; it is to be  regarded as such, but it does not thus exist to the transcendental  wisdom [of the wise]. 
 
63 and 64. (Chapter III, verses 79 and 80.) 
 
65. A proposition [is established] by means of conditions, reasons,  and examples, (<a name="273"><strong>273</strong></a>) such as a dream, the  Gandharva's [castle, fire-]wheel, mirage, the moon, the sun. 
 
66. By such examples as flame, hair, etc., I teach that birth is  something not to be recognised really as such;_1_ the world is  something imagined, empty like a dream, or Maya, which is error. 
 
67. The triple world has nowhere to place itself, either within nor  without, it is thus [homeless]; seeing that all beings are unborn, there  grows a full acceptance of the truth that nothing is ever born (<em>kshanti-anutpatti</em>). 
 
68. He will then attain the Samadhi called Maya-like, the will-body,  the psychic faculties, the self-mastery, the various powers belonging to  the Mind. 
 
69. All things existent are unborn, empty, and without  self-substance; and the delusion about them rises and ceases in  accordance with conditions. 
 
_1_ Here I have followed T'ang. 
 
70. Depending upon the Mind, there appears [within] a mind and,  without a world of individual objects (<em>rupina</em>); this and no other  is an external world which is imagined by the ignorant. 
 
71. This heap of bones, the Buddha-image, the analysis of the  elements—[these are subjects of meditation]; by means of mental images (<em>prajnapti</em>)  good students handle the various aspects of the world. 
 
72. Body, abode, and property are three representations (<em>vijnapti</em>)  seized upon [as objects]; the will, [the desire] to hold, the  discrimination of these representations are the seizing agents. 
 
(<a name="274"><strong>274</strong></a>) 73. As long as those philosophers who  get confused in their reasonings and who are unable to go beyond the  realm of words, distinguish the discriminating from the discriminated—so  long they do not see [the truth] of suchness. 
 
74. When the Yogin by means of his transcendental wisdom understands  that all things existent have no self-substance, he thus attains  calmness and establishes himself in the state of no-form (<em>animitta</em>). 
 
75. As an object painted black is taken by the unwise to be a cock,  so by the ignorant who do not know, the triple vehicle is understood in  like manner. 
 
76. There are no Sravakas, no Pratyekabuddhas here; if, however, one  recognises the form of a Buddha, of a Sravaka, this is a transformed  manifestation of the Bodhisattva whose nature is compassion itself. 
 
77. The triple world of existence is no more than  thought-construction, which is discriminated by the twofold Svabhava [of  imagination and relative knowledge]; but when [within the mind] a  turning-away from the course of sense-objects (<em>dharma</em>) and the  ego-soul (<em>pudgala</em>) takes place, then we have [the truth of]  suchness (<em>tathata</em>). 
 
78. The sun, the moon, the lamp-light, the elements, and the gems,  —each functions in its own way without discrimination; and so does the  Buddha's nature work on its own accord. 
 
79. <span style="color: blue;">(Chapter  II, verse 51.)</span> 
 
80. Things known as defiled or as pure are like hairnets [that is,  wrongly perceived by the dim-eyed]; (<a name="275"><strong>275</strong></a>) they  [really] have nothing to do with such notions as birth, abiding, and  disappearance, or as eternity and non-eternity. 
 
81. It is like a drugged man whoever he is, who sees the world in  golden colours; though there is no gold, for him the earth has changed  into gold. 
 
82. The ignorant, thus defiled since beginningless time with the mind  and what belongs to it, apprehend existing things to be really such as  they appear to be; though in fact they owe their origin to Maya or a  mirage. 
 
83. One seed and no-seed are of the same stamp, and one seed and all  seed also; and in one mind you see multiplicity. 
 
84. When one seed is made pure, there is a turning into a state of  no-seed; the sameness comes from non-discrimination; from superabundance  there is birth and general confusion from which there grows a multitude  of seeds, hence the designation all-seed._1_ 
 
85. (Chapter II, verse 140.) 
 
86. (Chapter III, verse 52.) 
 
87. When the self-nature of existence is understood there is no need  of keeping off the delusion; no-birth is the self-nature of existence,  seeing thus one is released.

93. When the mind is evolved, forms begin to manifest themselves;  really [if] no minds, no forms; the mind is due to [the accumulation of]  delusions since beginningless past; then the Yogin by his  transcendental wisdom sees the world shorn of its appearances (<em>abhasa</em>)._2_ 
 
_1_ The two verses 83 and 84 on "seed" (<em>bija</em>) require  fuller explanation to make them more intelligible. 
 
_2_ The first line of verse 94 properly belongs to the  preceding verse. 
 
94. (Chapter III, verse 53.) 
 
(<a name="277"><strong>277</strong></a>) 95. The Gandharva's air-castle, Maya, a  hair-circle, and a fata morgana, —they are non-entities yet they appear  as if they were entities; the nature of an objective existence is thus  to be regarded. 
 
96. Nothing has ever been brought into existence, all that is seen  before us is delusion; it is due to delusion that things are imagined to  have come into existence, the ignorant are delighted with the dualism  of discrimination. 
 
97. As memory [or habit-energy, <em>vasana</em>] grows in various forms  the Mind is evolved like the waves; when memory is cut off, there is no  evolving of Mind. 
 
98. The Mind is evolved dependent upon a variety of conditions, just  as a painting depends upon the wall [on which it is painted]; if  otherwise why is not the painting produced in the air?_1_ 
 
99. If Mind evolves at all depending on individual forms as  conditions, then Mind is condition-born, and the doctrine of Mind-only  will not be held true. 
 
100. Mind is grasped by mind, it is not a something produced by a  cause; Mind is by nature pure, memory (habit-energy) has no existence in  [mind which is like] the sky. 
 
101. An individual mind is evolved by clinging to Mind in itself;  there is no visible world outside [Mind itself]; therefore, [it is  declared that] Mind-only exists. 
 
(<a name="278"><strong>278</strong></a>) 102. Mind (<em>citta</em>_2_)  is the Alayavijnana, Manas is that which has reflection as its  characteristic nature, it apprehends the various sense-fields, for which  reason it is called a Vijnana. 
 
_1_ The Sanskrit as it stands is unintelligible; I have  followed the T'ang. This gatha may be regarded as a question to which  the following few verses are a reply. 
 
<em>_2_ </em> Citta which is generally translated "mind,"  either with the "m" capitalised or not, is used in this text in two  different senses. When it stands in the series of Citta, Manas, and  Vijnanas, it means the empirical mind. It is also used in a general  sense meaning mentation. Besides this, <em>citta</em> has an absolute  sense denoting something that goes beyond the realm of relativity and  yet that lies at the foundation of this world of particulars. When the <em>Lanka</em> speaks of "Mind-only," it refers to this something defined here. It is  important to keep this distinction in mind. See also my <em>Studies in  the Lankavatara</em>, p. 176 and elsewhere. 
 
103. Citta is always neutral; Manas functions in two ways; the  functioning Vijnana is either good or bad. 
 
104. (Chapter II, verse 132.) 
 
105-109. (Chapter IV, verses 1-5.) 
 
(<a name="279"><strong>279</strong></a>) 110. In self-realisation itself there  are no time[-limits]; it goes beyond all the realms belonging to the  various stages; transcending the measure of thought, it establishes  itself as the result [of discipline in the realm] of no-appearance. 
 
111. That non-existence and existence is recognised, and multiplicity  too, is due to erroneous attachment of the ignorant; the error [is to  see] multiplicity. 
 
112. If there is non-discriminative knowledge, it is not in accord  with reason to say that [individual] realities (<em>vastu</em>) exist;  because of Mind, there are no individual forms (<em>rupani</em>), and,  therefore, we speak of non-discriminative [knowledge]. 
 
113. The sense-organs are to be known as Maya, the sense-fields  resemble a dream; actor, act, and acting—they do not at all [in reality]  exist._1_

120. According to worldly knowledge (<em>samvriti</em>) everything  exists, but in ultimate truth (<em>paramartha</em>) none exists; in  ultimate truth, indeed, one sees that all things are devoid of  self-substance. Although there is no self-substance, there rises  something which one perceives [as objective reality] — this is called  worldly knowledge. 
 
121. If things are regarded as existing by themselves, they exist  because of their being so designated in words; if there were no words to  designate their existence, they are not. 
 
_1_ This verse is missing in Wei. 
 
122. That which exists only as word and not as reality —such is not  to be found even in worldly knowledge; this comes from the nature of  reality being erroneously understood, for no such perception is  possible. 
 
123. If such errors were granted, it would not be possible to talk  about the non-existence of self-substance; (<a name="281"><strong>281</strong></a>)  as the nature of reality is erroneously understood, there is something  perceived where there is really no self-substance; all is indeed  non-existent. 
 
124. What is seen as multiplicity is the mind saturated with the  forms of evil habits; because of mental delusions one clings to forms  and appearances regarding them as objective [realities]. 
 
125. Discrimination is cut asunder by non-discriminating  discrimination; the truth of emptiness is seen into by  non-discriminating discrimination. 
 
126. Like an elephant magically created, like golden leaves in a  painting, the visible world is to the people whose minds are saturated  with the forms of ignorance. 
 
127-128. (Chapter II, vv. 168 and 169.) 
 
129. As a man whose eye is affected with a cataract perceives a  hair-circle because of his delusion, so the ignorant perceive an  objective world rising with its various aspects. 
 
130. (Chapter II, v. 150.) 
 
(<a name="282"><strong>282</strong></a>) 131. Discrimination, that which is  discriminated, and the setting up of discrimination; binding, that which  is bound, and its cause: these six are conditions of liberation. 
 
132. There are no stages [of Bodhisattvaship], no truths, no  [Buddha-]lands, no bodies of transformation; Buddhas. Pratyekabuddhas,  Sravakas are [products of] imagination. 
 
133. (Chapter II, v. 139.) 
 
134. Mind is all, it is found everywhere and in every body; it is by  the evil-minded that multiplicity is recognised, there are no  [recognisable] marks where Mind-only is. 
 
135-137. (Chapter III, vv. 35, 36, 37.) 
 
138. The constructing of appearances (<em>nimitta</em>) created by  delusion is the characteristic mark of Paratantra (dependence)  knowledge; (<a name="283"><strong>283</strong></a>) the giving of names to these  appearances [regarding them as real individual existences] is  characteristic of the imagination._1_ 
 
139. When the constructing of appearances and names, which come from  the union of conditions and realities, no more takes place, we have the  characteristic mark of perfected knowledge <em>(parinishpanna)._2_</em> 
 
140. The world is everywhere filled with Buddhas of Maturity,_3_ Buddhas of Transformation,_4_ beings, Bodhisattvas, and  [Buddha-]lands. 
 
141. The Issuing_5_[-Buddhas], Dharma[-Buddhas],  Transformation[-Buddhas] and those that appear transformed—they all come  forth from Amitabha's Land of Bliss. 
 
142. What is uttered by Buddhas of Transformation and what is uttered  by Buddhas of Maturity constitute the doctrine fully developed in the  sutras, whose secret meaning you should know. 
 
143. What is uttered by the Bodhisattvas and what is uttered by the  teachers—they are both what is uttered by the Buddhas of Transformation  and not by the Buddhas of Maturity. 
 
144. All these individual objects (<em>dharmas</em>) have never been  born, but they are not exactly non-existent either; they resemble the  Gandharva's castle, a dream, and magical creations. 
 
145. Mind is set in motion in various ways, and mind is liberated;  mind rises in no other way, and mind thus ceases. 
 
_1_ Generally <em>parikalpita</em>, but here <em>vikalpita</em>. 
 
_2_ This is the reading of T'ang, but I suggest the  following: "When the constructing of names and appearances no more takes  place in it, there are only causal signs indicative of reality—this is  the characteristic mark of perfected knowledge." Both Wei and T'ang here  understand <em>sanketa</em> in the sense of "union."

_4_ <em>Nairmanika</em>. 
 
_5_ <em>Nisyanda</em>. 
 
146. The mind of all beings is that which perceives something like  objective reality, and this mind is the product of imagination; (<a name="284"><strong>284</strong></a>) in Mind-only there is no objective world;  when one is released from discrimination there is liberation. 
 
147. Brought together by the evil habit of erroneous reasoning,  discrimination asserts itself; hence the evolution of this fallacious  world. 
 
148. [Relative] knowledge (<em>vijnana</em>) takes place where there is  something resembling an external world; [transcendental] knowledge (<em>jnana</em>)_1_ belongs to the realm of Suchness. When a turning-back (<em>paravritta</em>)  takes place, there is a state of imagelessness, which is the realm of  the wise. 
 
149. (Chapter II, v. 161.) 
 
150. By reason of false imagination (<em>parikalpita</em>) all things  existent are declared unborn; as people take refuge in relative  knowledge (<em>paratantra</em>), they get confused in their  discriminations. 
 
151. When relative knowledge is purified by keeping itself aloof from  discrimination, and detached from imagination, there is a turning-back  to the abode of suchness. 
 
152. Do not discriminate discrimination, there is no truth in  discrimination; [this world of] delusion is discriminated as to that  which is perceived and that which perceives, but in reality there is no  such dualism in it; it is an error to recognise an external world, [the  conception of] self-substance is due to imagination. 
 
(<a name="285"><strong>285</strong></a>) 153. Imagining by this imagination,  self-substance is conceived to rise by the conditions of origination (<em>pratyayodbhava</em>);  an external world is recognised in distortion, there is [in fact] no  such external world, but just the Mind. 
 
154. To those who see [the world] clearly and properly, the  separation between that which perceives and that which is perceived  ceases; there is no such external world as is discriminated by the  ignorant. 
 
_1_As to the distinction between Jnana and Vijnana see <a href="http://lirs.ru/do/lanka_eng/lanka-chapter-3.htm#LXVI">p.135</a> et  seq. 
 
155. When the Mind is agitated by habit-energy (or memory) there  rises what appears to be an external world; when the dualistic  imagination ceases there grows [transcendental] knowledge (<em>jnana</em>),  the realm of suchness, the realm of the wise, which is free from  appearances and beyond thought._1_ 
 
156. <span style="color: blue;">(Chap. II, v. 134; Chap.  VI, v. 3.)</span> 
 
157. From the union of mother and father, the Alaya gets connected  with Manas; like a rat in a pot of ghee, the red together with the white  grows up. 
 
158. Through the stages of Pesi, Ghana, and Arbuda, the boil grows—an  unclean mass bearing a variety of karma; nourished by the wind of karma  and the four elements, it comes to maturity like a fruit. 
 
159. The five, the five, and the five; and the sores are nine; (<a name="286"><strong>286</strong></a>) nails, teeth, and hair are supplied; when  ready to spring forth it is born. 
 
160. When [the baby] is just born, it is like a worm growing in the  dung; like a man waking from sleep, the eye begins to distinguish forms,  and discrimination goes on increasing. 
 
161. With knowledge gained by discrimination, human speech is  produced from the combination of the palate, lips, and cavity; and  discrimination goes on like a parrot. 
 
162. Philosophical doctrines are definite, but the Mahayana [or Great  Vehicle] is not definite, it is set in motion by the thoughts of  beings; it is not an abode for those who see wrongly. The vehicle  realised within my own inner self is not the realm that can be reached  by dialecticians._2_ 
 
163-164. After the passing of the Teacher, pray tell me who will be  the bearer [of the Mahayana]? O Mahamati, thou shouldst know that there  will be one who bears the Dharma, when sometime is past after the  Sugata's entrance into Nirvana. 
 
165. In Vedali, in the southern part, a Bhikshu most illustrious and  distinguished [will be born]; his name is Nagahvaya, he is the destroyer  of the one-sided views based on being and non-being. 
 
_1_ The first line of verse 156 is a part of the preceding  one. Cf. v. 148. 
 
_2_ The verses are wrongly divided here, for this line  properly belongs to 162 and not to 163. 
 
166. He will declare my Vehicle, the unsurpassed Mahayana, to the  world; attaining the stage of Joy he will go to the Land of Bliss. 
 
(<a name="287"><strong>287</strong></a>) 167. (Chapter II, v. 175.) 
 
168. In the realm of conditional origination, "there is" and "there  is not" do not take place; those who imagine something real in the midst  of conditional origination say, "there is" and "there is not," but  these philosophical views are far away from my teaching. 
 
169. The giving names to all things existent has always been going on  for hundreds of generations past; this has been repeated, is being  repeated constantly; an endless mutual discrimination is thus taking  place. 
 
170. If this designating does not take place, the whole world falls  into confusion; thus names are established in order to get rid of  confusion. 
 
171. Things existent are discriminated by the ignorant in the  threefold form of discrimination; there is delusion from discriminating  names, from conditional origination, and from the [the notion of] being  born. 
 
172. [The philosophers argue that] the primary elements are unborn  and like the sky are imperishable; but [in reality] there are no  individual self-substances and the notion [itself] belongs to  discrimination. 
 
173. [Individual existences are] appearances, images, like Maya, like  a mirage, a dream, a wheel made by a revolving fire-brand, the  Gandharva's [castle], an echo—they are all born in the same manner. 
 
(<a name="288"><strong>288</strong></a>) 174. Non-duality, suchness, emptiness,  ultimate limit, essence (<em>dharmata</em>), non-discrimination, —all  these I teach as belonging to the aspect of perfected knowledge (<em>parinishpanna</em>). 
 
175. Language belongs to the realm of thought, the truth becomes  [thus] wrongly [represented]; transcendental knowledge (<em>prajna</em>)  being discriminated by thought falls into a duality; therefore,  transcendental knowledge is something not imagined. 
 
176-177. (Chap. III, vv. 9 and 10.) 
 
178. The whole existence is not perceived by the ignorant as it is  perceived by the wise; the whole existence as it is perceived by the  wise, has no marks [of individuation]. 
 
179. As a spurious necklace, not of gold though looking like it, is  imagined by the ignorant to be of [genuine] gold, so all things are  imagined by those who reason wrongly. 
 
180. (Chapter III, v. 11.) 
 
181. Things have no beginning, no end; they are abiding in the aspect  of reality; (<a name="289"><strong>289</strong></a>) there is no creator, nothing  doing in the world, but the logicians do not understand. 
 
182. Whatever things that are thought to have been in existence in  the past, to come into existence in the future, or to be in existence at  present, —all such are unborn. 
 
183-184. (Chap. III, vv. 44 and 45.) 
 
185. This [world] is just a sign_1_ indicative of reality (<em>dharmata</em>);  apart from the sign, nothing is produced, nothing is destroyed. 
 
186-187. (Chap. II, vv. 159 and 160.) 
 
188-189. (Chap. III, vv. 1 and 2.) 
 
(<a name="290"><strong>290</strong></a>) 190. Existence in its conditional  relations cannot be [described] as unity or diversity; it is just in a  general way of speaking that there is birth, cessation, and destruction. 
 
191. Emptiness unborn is one thing, emptiness born is another;  emptiness unborn is the better, [because] emptiness born leads to  destruction. 
 
192. Suchness, emptiness, the limit, Nirvana, and the Dharmadhatu,  the various will-made bodies, —these I point out as synonymous. 
 
193. Those who discriminate purity according to the Sutras, Vinayas,  and Abhidharmas, follow books and not the inner meaning; they are not  established in egolessness. 
 
194-196. (Chap. III, vv. 12-14.) 
 
(<a name="291"><strong>291</strong></a>) 197. The visible world is likened to  the hare's horns as long as all beings go on discriminating; those who  discriminate are deluded just like a deer running after a mirage. 
 
_1_ <em>Sanketa</em>; see also verse 139. 
 
198. By clinging to discrimination, [more] discrimination goes on;  when the cause of discrimination is put away, one is disengaged  therefrom. 
 
199-200. (Chap. III, vv. 54 and 55.) 
 
201. Transcendental knowledge is deep, exalted, far-reaching, and  perceives all the Buddha-countries; this I teach for the sons of the  Victorious One; for the Sravakas I teach transitoriness. 
 
202. The triple existence is transitory, empty, devoid of the ego and  what belongs to it; thus I teach the doctrine of generality to the  Sravakas. 
 
203. Not to be attached to anything existent, truly knowing what the  truth of solitude is, is to walk all alone; the fruit of  Pratyekabuddhahood which is above speculation is what I teach. 
 
204. External objects are imagined, those endowed with corporeality  are dependent on relative knowledge; being deluded they see not  themselves, therefore a mind is evolved. 
 
205(<a name="292"><strong>292</strong></a>)-206. (Chap. IV, vv. 6 and 7.) 
 
207 and 208. (Chapter III, verses 56 and 57.) 
 
209. (Chapter II, verse 153.) 
 
210. <span style="color: blue;">(Chapter  II, verse 150.)</span> 
 
211. There are four psychic powers: that which comes from the  maturing [of the disciplinary exercises], that which comes from the  sustaining power of the Buddhas, that which rises from entering into the  various paths of living beings, and that which is obtained in a dream. 
 
212. The psychic power which is obtained in a dream, that which comes  from the power of the Buddhas, and that which has its birth by entering  the various paths of beings —these powers are not_1_ born of  the maturing [of the disciplinary exercises]. 
 
(<a name="293"><strong>293</strong></a>) 213. The mind being influenced by  habit-energy, there rises a something resembling real existence (<em>bhavabhasa</em>);  as the ignorant do not understand, it is said that there is the birth  [of realities]. 
 
_1_ Read after the Chinese and Tibetan versions. Not <em>vijnana-vipakajah</em>,  but <em>'bhijna na vipakajah</em>. 
 
214. As long as external objects (<em>bahyam</em>)_1_ are  discriminated as possessing individual marks, the mind is confused (<em>vimuhyate</em>)_2_ being unable to see its own delusion. 
 
215. Why is birth spoken of? Why is not the perceived world spoken  of? When the perceived world, which has no existence, is yet perceived  as existing, what is that which is spoken of? To whom is it? and why? 
 
216. The Citta in its essence is thoroughly pure, the Manas is  defiled, and the Manas is with the Vijnanas, habit-energy is always  casting out [its seeds]. 
 
217. The Alaya is released from the body, the Manas solicits the  [various] paths of existence; the Vijnana is deluded with something  resembling an objective world, and perceiving it is befooled._3_ 
 
218. What is seen is one's own mind, an objective world exists not;  when one thus perceives [that existence is] an error,_4_ one  even gets into suchness. 
 
219. The [spiritual] realm attained by Dhyana-devotees, karma, and  the exalted state of the Buddhas—these three are beyond thought, they  belong to the Vijnana-_5 _realm that surpasses thought. 
 
(<a name="294"><strong>294</strong></a>) 220. The past and the future, Nirvana,  a personal ego, [space_6_], words, —of these I talk because of  worldly convention, but ultimate reality is beyond the letter. 
 
221. The two vehicles_7_ and the philosophers are one in  their dependence on [wrong] views; they are confused in regard to  Mind-only, and imagine an external existence. 
 
222. The enlightenment attained by the Pratyekabuddhas, Buddhahood,  Arhatship, and the seeing of the Buddhas—these are the secret seeds that  grow in enlightenment; but it is accomplished in a dream._8_ 
 
_1_ After the Chinese. 
 
_2_ After Wei. 
 
_3_ <em>Pralubhyate</em>, "greedily attached," according to  Wei and T'ang. 
 
_4_ <em>Bhranti</em>, "a delusion," "an external world." 
 
_5_ Should be <em>jnana</em>, or does it refer to the Alaya? 
 
_6_ According to the Chinese. 
 
_7_ <em>Naikayikas</em>, literally, "they who belong to the  Nikaya." 
 
_8_ What this verse purports to mean is difficult to gather  from the contents of the <em>Lankavatara</em> as we have it here. The  existence of such verses as this, and there are quite a number of them  in the Sagathakam, suggests in one way that this verge section has no  organic relation with the main text. 
 
223. Maya, Citta (mind), intelligence,_1_ tranquillity, the  dualism of being and non-being—where are these teachings? for whom?  whence? wherefore? and of what signification? Pray tell me. 
 
224. I teach such things as Maya, being and non-being, etc., to those  who are confused in the teaching of Mind-only; when birth and death are  linked together [as one], qualified and qualifying are removed. 
 
225. Another name for Manas is discrimination (<em>vikalpa</em>), and  it goes along with the five Vijnanas; mind seeds (<em>cittabija</em>) take  their rise in the way images [appear in a mirror] or [waves roll on]  the ocean-waters. 
 
226. When the Citta, Manas, Vijnana cease to rise, (<a name="295"><strong>295</strong></a>)  then there is the attainment of the will-body and of the Buddha-stage. 
 
227. Causation, the Dhatus, Skandhas, and the self-nature of all  things, thought-construction, a personal soul, and mind—they are all  like a dream, like a hair-net. 
 
228. Seeing the world as like Maya and a dream, one abides with the  truth; the truth, indeed, is free from individual marks, removed from  speculative reasoning. 
 
229. The inner realisation attained by the wise always abides in a  state of no-memory_2_; it leads the world to the truth as it is  not confused with speculative reasoning. 
 
230. When all false speculation subsides, error no more rises; as  long as there is discriminative knowledge,_3_ error keeps on  rising. 
 
231. The world is empty and has no self-nature; to talk of permanency  and impermanency is the view maintained by followers of birth and not  by those of no-birth. 
 
232. [The philosophers] imagine the world to be of oneness and  otherness, of bothness [and not-bothness], and [to have risen] from  Isvara, or spontaneously, or from time, or from a supreme spirit, or  other causal agency. 
 
_1_ The Chinese read <em>gati</em> (path or course), and not <em>mati</em>. 
 
_2_<em> Asmara</em>, T'ang. 
 
_3_<em> Jnana</em> for <em>prajna</em>. 
 
233. The Vijnana which is the seed of transmigration is not evolved  when this visible world is [truly] recognised; like a picture on a wall,  it disappears when [its nature] is recognised. 
 
(<a name="296"><strong>296</strong></a>) 234. Like figures in Maya, people are  born and die; in the same way the ignorant because of their stupidity  [imagine] there really is bondage and release. 
 
235. The duality of the world, inner and outer, and things subject to  causation—by distinctly understanding what they are, one is established  in imagelessness. 
 
236. The mind (<em>citta</em>) is not separate from habit-energy, nor  is it together with it; though enveloped with habit-energy the mind  itself remains undifferentiated. 
 
237. Habit-energy born of the Manovijnana is like dirt wherewith the  Citta, which is a perfectly white garment, is enveloped and fails to  display itself. 
 
238. As space is neither existent nor non-existent, so is the Alaya  in the body, I say; it is devoid of existence as well as of  non-existence. 
 
239. When the Manovijnana is "turned over" (<em>vyarritta</em>), the  Citta frees itself from turbidity; by understanding [the nature of] all  things, the mind (<em>citta</em>) becomes Buddha, I say. 
 
240. Removed from the triple continuity, devoid of being and  non-being, released from the four propositions, all things (<em>bhava</em>)  are always like Maya. 
 
241. The [first] seven stages are mind-born and belong to the two  Svabhavas; the remaining [two] stages and the Buddha-stage are the  Nishpanna ("perfected knowledge"). 
 
(<a name="297"><strong>297</strong></a>) 242. The world of form, of no-form,  and the world of desire, and Nirvana are in this body; all is told to  belong to the realm of Mind. 
 
243. As long as there is something attained, there is so much error  rising; when the Mind itself is thoroughly understood, error neither  rises nor ceases. 
 
244. (Chapter II, verse 171.) 
 
245. (Chapter II, verse 131.) 
 
246. Two things are established by me; individual objects and  realisation; there are four principles which constitute the dogmas of  logic. 
 
247. The error [or the world] is discriminated when it is seen as  characterised with varieties of forms and figures; when names and forms  are removed self-nature becomes pure which is the realm of the wise. 
 
248. As long as discrimination is carried on, the Parikalpita (false  imagination) continues to take place; but as what is imagined by  discrimination has no reality, self-nature is [truly understood in] the  realm of the wise. 
 
249. The mind emancipated is truth constant and everlasting; the  essence making up the self-nature of things (<a name="298"><strong>298</strong></a>)  and suchness is devoid of discrimination. 
 
250. There is reality (<em>vastu</em>); it is not to be qualified as  pure, nor is it to be said defiled; since a mind purified leaves traces  of defilement, but reality is the truth that is [absolutely] pure,  belonging to the realm of the wise. 
 
251. The world is born of causation; when it is regarded as removed  from discrimination and as resembling Maya, a dream, etc., one is  emancipated. 
 
252. Varieties of habit-energy growing out of error are united with  the mind; they are perceived by the ignorant as objects externally  existing; and the essence of mind (<em>cittasya dharmata</em>) is not  perceived. 
 
253. The essence of mind is pure but not the mind that is born of  error; error rises from error, therefore Mind is not perceived. 
 
254. Delusion itself is no more than truth, truth is neither in  Samskara nor anywhere else, but it is where Samskara is observed [in its  proper bearings]. 
 
255. When the Samskrita is seen as devoid of qualified and  qualifying, all predicates are discarded and thus the world is seen as  of Mind itself. 
 
256. When the [Yogin] enters upon Mind-only_7_, he will  cease discriminating an external world; establishing himself where  suchness has its asylum he will pass on to Mind-only._1_ 
 
_1_ <em>Cittamatram</em> here and in the following verse is  rendered in T'ang as 心量 (<em>hsin-liang</em>) and  not the usual 唯心 (<em>wei-hsin</em>). <em>Hsin-liang</em> means "mind-measurement," the term used in Sung throughout for <em>cittamatram</em>,  for in the days of Sung <em>wei-shin</em> had not been thought of. But  why does T'ang use <em>hsin-liang</em> for <em>wei-shin</em> in this  particular case while <em>wei-shin</em> is used in the preceding line?  Does <em>cittamatram</em> mean here simply "mental or intellectual  measurement" and is not used in the technical sense in which the term is  found elsewhere in this sutra? 
 
257. By passing on to Mind-only, he passes on to the state of  imagelessness; (<a name="299"><strong>299</strong></a>) when he establishes  himself in the state of imagelessness, he sees not [even] the Mahayana._1_ 
 
258. The state of non-striving (<em>anabhoga</em>) is quiescent and  thoroughly purified with the [original] vows; the most excellent  knowledge of egolessness sees no [duality in the world] because of  imagelessness. 
 
259. Let him review the realm of mind, let him review the realm of  knowledge, let him review the realm, with transcendental knowledge (<em>prajna</em>),  and he will not be confounded with individual signs. 
 
260. Pain belongs to mind, accumulation is the realm of knowledge (<em>jnana</em>);  the [remaining] two truths_2_ and the Buddha-stage are where  transcendental knowledge functions. 
 
261. The attainment of the fruits, Nirvana, and the eightfold  path—when all these truths are thus understood, there is  Buddha-knowledge thoroughly purified. 
 
262. The eye, form, light, space, and attention (<em>manas</em>) —out  of this [combination] there is the birth of consciousness (<em>vijnana</em>)  in people; consciousness is indeed born of the Alaya. 
 
263. There is nothing grasped, nor grasping, nor one who grasps;  there are no names, no objects; those who carry on their groundless  discriminative way of thinking lack intelligence. 
 
264. Name is not born of meaning, nor is meaning born of name; (<a name="300"><strong>300</strong></a>) whether things are born of cause or of  no-cause, such is discrimination; have no discrimination! 
 
265. (Chapter II, verse 145.) 
 
_1_ "Not" (<em>na</em>) is replaced by "he" (<em>sa</em>) in one  MS. May this be a better reading? 
 
_2_ Referring to the Four Noble Truths. 
 
266. Imagining himself to be standing on a truth, he discourses on  thought-construction; oneness is not attained in five ways, and thus the  truth is abandoned._1_ 
 
267. Delusion (<em>prapanca</em>) is the evil one who is to be broken  down; being and non-being is to be transcended; as one sees into [the  truth of] egolessness, he has no longing for, no evil thought of, the  world. 
 
268. [The philosophers imagine] a permanently existing creator  engaged in mere verbalism; highest truth is beyond words, the Dharma is  seen when cessation takes place. 
 
269. Leaning on the Alaya for support the Manas is evolved; depending  on the Citta and Manas the Vijnana-system is evolved. 
 
270. What is established by a proposition (<em>samaropa</em>) is a  proposition; suchness is the essence of mind; when this is clearly  perceived, the Yogin attains the knowledge of Mind-only. 
 
271. Let one not think of the Manas, individual signs, and reality  from the point of view of permanency and impermanency; nor let him think  in his meditation of birth and no-birth. 
 
272. They do not discriminate duality; the Vijnana rises from Alaya; (<a name="301"><strong>301</strong></a>) the oneness of meaning thus taking place is  not to be known by a dually operating mind. 
 
273. There is neither a speaker nor speaking nor emptiness, since the  Mind is seen; but when the Mind is not seen there rises a net of  philosophical doctrines. 
 
274. There is no rising of the causation[-chain], nor are there any  sense-organs; no Dhatus, no Skandhas, no greed, no Samskrita. 
 
275. There is no primarily working fire;_2_ no working done,  no effects produced, no final limit, no power, no deliverance, no  bondage. 
 
_1_ The reference is not clear. 
 
_2_ T'ang has, "karma and its effects"; while Wei has,  "karma in work." 
 
276. There is no state of being to be called neutral [or  inexplicable] (<em>avyakrita</em>); there is no duality of dharma and  adharma; there is no time, no Nirvana, no dharma-essence. 
 
277. And there are no Buddhas, no truths, no fruition, no causal  agents, no perversion, no Nirvana, no passing away, no birth. 
 
278. And then there are no twelve elements (<em>anga</em>), and no  duality either, of limit and no-limit; because of the cessation of all  the notions [that are cherished by the philosophers] I declare [there  is] Mind-only. 
 
279. The passions, path of karma, the body, creators, fruitions—they  are like a fata morgana and a dream; they are like a city of the  Gandharvas. 
 
280. By maintaining the Mind-only, the idea of reality is removed; by  establishing the Mind-only permanency and annihilation are seen [in  their proper relationship]. 
 
281. There are no Skandhas in Nirvana, nor is there an ego-soul, nor  any individual signs; (<a name="302"><strong>302</strong></a>) by entering into  the Mind-only, one escapes from becoming attached to emancipation. 
 
282. It is error (<em>dosha</em>) that causes the world to be  externally perceived as it is manifested to people; Mind is not born of  the visible world; therefore, Mind is not visible. 
 
283. It is the habit-energy of people that brings out into view  something resembling body, property, and abode; Mind is neither a being  nor a non-being, it does not reveal itself because of habit-energy. 
 
284. Dirt is revealed within purity but purity itself is not soiled;  as when the sky is veiled with clouds, Mind is invisible [when defiled  with error].

(<a name="303"><strong>303</strong></a>) 290. Mind is not born of the elements (<em>bhuta</em>),  Mind is nowhere to be seen; it is the habit-energy of people that  brings out into view body, property, and abode._1_ 
 
_1_ This is a repetition of the latter half of verse 282 and  the first half of 283. This is omitted in both T'ang and Wei, showing  that the insertion is probably due to a clerical mistake. 
 
291. All that is element-made is not form and form is not  element-made; the city of the Gandharvas, a dream, Maya, an image,  —these are not element-made. 
 
292._1_ 
 
293._2_ 
 
294. (Chapter III, verse 43.) 
 
295. As reality and non-reality can be predicated of existence that  originates from causation, the view of oneness and otherness definitely  belongs to them. 
 
296-302. (Chapter II, verses 184-190.) 
 
(<a name="304"><strong>304</strong></a>) 303. There are three kinds of my  Sravakas: the transformed, the born of the vows, and the Sravakas  disengaged from greed and anger, and born of the Dharma. 
 
304. There are three kinds, also, of the Bodhisattvas: those who have  not yet reached Buddhahood, those who manifest themselves according to  the thoughts of sentient beings, and those who are seen in the likeness  of the Buddha._3_ 
 
305-310. (Chapter II, verses 191-196.) 
 
(<a name="305"><strong>305</strong></a>) 311. It is a man's mind that is  perceived as something resembling (<em>samnibham</em>) the form of a star,  a cloud, a moon, a sun; and what is thus perceived by them is born of  habit-energy. 
 
312. The elements are devoid of selfhood, there is neither qualified  nor qualifying in them; if all element-made objects were the elements,  form (<em>rupa</em>) would be element-made. 
 
_1_ The first half of this corresponds to the first half of  Chapter III, verse 42; while the second half of 292 and the first half  of 293 are practically a repetition of 290, and also of the second half  of 282 and the first half of 283. Nanjo's verse divisions are to be  revised I think in some places, but fearing to cause greater confusion  in the numbering of the whole "Sagathakam" I have followed Nanjo. 
 
_2_ The first half of 292 and the second half of 293  correspond to Chapter III, verse 42, 
 
_3_ This is the T'ang reading. Another reading is: "There  are three kinds of Bodhisattvas. As to the Buddhas, they have no  [tangible] form, but something looking like a Buddha may be seen  according to the thoughts of each sentient being." 
 
313. The elements are uniform, there are no element-made objects in  the elements; the elements are the cause; the earth, water, etc. are the  result. 
 
314. Substances and forms of thought-construction are like things  born of Maya; (<a name="306"><strong>306</strong></a>) they appear like a dream  and a city of the Gandharvas, they are a mirage and a fifth._1_ 
 
315. There are five kinds of the Icchantika, so with the families  which are five; there are five vehicles and no-vehicle, and six kinds of  Nirvana. 
 
316.  The Skandhas are divided into twenty-five, and there are eight  kinds of form, twenty-four Buddhas, and there are two kinds of  Buddha-sons. 
 
317. There are one hundred and eight doctrines, and three kinds of  Sravakas; there is one land of the Buddhas, and so with the Buddha,  there is one. 
 
318. Likewise with emancipation; there are three forms, four kinds of  mind-streams, six kinds of my egolessness, and also four kinds of  knowledge. 
 
319. Disjoined from causal agencies, removed from faulty theories, is  the knowledge of self-realisation, which is the Mahayana, immovable and  highest. 
 
320. Of birth and no-birth there are eight and nine kinds; whether  the attainment is instantaneous or successive, it is one realisation. 
 
321. There are eight worlds of formlessness; Dhyana is divided into  six; and with the Pratyekabuddhas and Buddha-sons, there are seven forms  of emancipation. 
 
322. There are no such things as the past, present, and future; there  is neither permanency nor impermanency; doing, work, and fruition—all  is no more than a dream-event. 
 
323. From beginning to end the Buddhas, Sravakas, and Buddha-sons  have never been born; (<a name="307"><strong>307</strong></a>) the mind is removed  from what is visible, being always a Maya-like existence. 
 
_1_ The text gives no clue to this. Is <em>prajnaptirupam</em> (form of thought-construction) the same as <em>vijnaptirupam</em> of the <em>Abhiaharmakosa</em>? 
 
324. Thus the abode in the Tushita heaven, the conception, the birth,  the leaving, the worldly life, the revolving of the wheel, the  wandering about in all the countries. [A Buddha] is seen [doing all  these things], but he is not one born of the womb. 
 
325. Thus, for the sake of sentient beings who are wandering and  moving about from one place to another, emancipation is taught, the  truth, the knowledge of the [Buddha-]land, and the rising of things by  causation. 
 
326. Worlds, forests, islands, egolessness, philosophers, wanderings,  Dhyanas, the vehicles, the Alaya, the attainments, the inconceivable  realm of fruition, 
 
327. Families of the moon and stars, families of kings, abodes of the  gods, families of the Yakshas and Gandharvas, —they are all born of  karma and are born of desire. 
 
328. Inconceivable transformation-death is [still] in union with  habit-energy; when interrupted, death is put a stop to, the net of  passions is destroyed. 
 
329. [The Bodhisattva] is not to keep_1_ money, grain, gold,  land, goods, kine and sheep, slaves, nor horses, elephants, etc. 
 
330. He is not to sleep on a perforated couch, nor is he to smear the  ground with mud;_2_ he is not to have a bowl made of gold,  silver, brass, or copper. 
 
331. Let the Yogin have white cloth dyed in dark blue or brownish-red  with cow-dung, or mud, or fruits, or leaves. 
 
(<a name="308"><strong>308</strong></a>) 332. The Yogin is permitted to carry a  bowl of full Magadha measure made of either stone, or clay, or iron, or  shell, or quartz. 
 
333. The Yogin whose final aim is to discipline himself may carry a  curved knife four fingers long for cutting cloth; he who is intent on  disciplining himself may not learn the science of mechanics. 
 
334. The Yogin who disciplines himself in the exercises is not to be  engaged in buying and selling: [if necessary] let the attendant see to  it—these are the regulations I teach.

335. Thus, guarding his senses, let him have an exact understanding  in the meaning of the Sutras and the Vinaya, and let him not associate  with men of the world, such I call the Yogin. 
 
336. Let the Yogin prepare his abode in an empty house, or a  cemetery, or under a tree, or in a cavern, or among the straw, or in an  open place. 
 
337. Let [the Yogin] dress himself in three garments, whether in the  cemetery or any other place; if anyone should voluntarily give him a  garment—let him accept it. 
 
338. When he goes about begging food, let him look ahead not more  than the length of a yoke; let him conduct himself in the way bees treat  flowers. 
 
339. When the Yogin finds himself in a large company, in the  confusion of a company, or with Bhikshunis [women-mendicants], this is  not a desirable relationship for Yogins; for it means to share a  livelihood with them. 
 
340. The Yogin, whose aim is to discipline himself in the exercise, (<a name="309"><strong>309</strong></a>) is not to approach for his food kings,  princes, ministers of state, or persons of rank. 
 
341. In houses where a death or a birth has taken place, or in the  houses of friends and relatives, or where Bhikshus and Bhikshunis are  mixed together, it is not proper for the Yogins to take their food. 
 
342. In the monasteries food is always regularly cooked, and when it  is purposely prepared [somewhere else], it is not proper for the Yogins  to take their food. 
 
343. The Yogin should regard the world as removed from birth and  death, as exempt from the alternation of being and non-being, though it  is seen in the aspect of qualified and qualifying. 
 
344. When birth [and death] is not discriminated, the Yogin before  long will attain the Samadhi, the powers, the psychic faculties, and the  self-mastery. 
 
345. The Yogin should not cherish the thought that the world exists  from such causal agents as atoms, time, or supreme soul; nor that it is  born of causes and conditions. 
 
346. From self-discrimination the world is imagined, which is born of  varieties of habit-energy; let the Yogin perceive existence as always  like unto Maya and a dream. 
 
347. The [true] insight is always removed from assertions as well as  from negations; let not [the Yogin] discriminate the triple world which  appears as body, property, and abode. 
 
348. Not thinking how to obtain food and drink, but holding his body  upright, let him pay homage over and over again to the Buddhas and  Bodhisattvas. 
 
349. Gathering truth from the Vinaya, from the teachings in the  Sutras, let the Yogin have a clear insight into the five Dharmas, Mind  itself, and egolessness. 
 
(<a name="310"><strong>310</strong></a>) 350. The Yogin should have a distinct  understanding of the undefiled truth of self-realisation and as to what  the stages [of Bodhisattvahood] and the Buddha-stage are and be anointed  on the great lotus [seat]. 
 
351. Wandering through all the paths, he becomes averse to existence,  and directing his steps toward some quiet cemetery he will begin  various practices. 
 
352-354. (Chapter II, verses 162-164.) 
 
355. [According to the philosophers] there is a reality born of  no-cause, neither permanent nor subject to annihilation, and removed  from the alternatives of being and non-being, and this is imagined by  them to be the Middle Path. 
 
356. They imagine the theory of no-cause but their no-cause is  nihilistic; as they fail to understand [the real nature of] external  objects they destroy the Middle Path. 
 
357. The attachment to existence is not abandoned for the fear of  being nihilistic, and they try to teach the Middle Path by means of  assertion and negation. 
 
(<a name="311"><strong>311</strong></a>) 358. When Mind-only is understood,  external objects are abandoned and discrimination no more takes place;  here the Middle Path is reached. 
 
359. There is Mind-only, there is no visible world; as there is no  visible world, [Mind] is not risen;_1_ this is taught by myself  and other [Tathagatas] to be the Middle Path. 
 
_1_ After T'ang. Wei has: "Apart from Mind there is no  rising." No rising of a visible world? 
 
360. Birth and no-birth, being and non-being, —these are all empty;  there is no self-nature in all things; the duality is not to be  cherished. 
 
361. Where there is no possibility of discrimination taking its rise,  the ignorant imagine there is emancipation; but as there is no  understanding [in them] as to the rise of a mind, how can they destroy  their attachment to duality!_1_ 
 
362. As it is understood that there is nothing but what is seen of  the Mind, the attachment to duality is destroyed; knowledge, indeed, is  the abandonment, not the destruction of the discriminated. 
 
363. As it becomes thoroughly known that there is nothing but what is  seen of the Mind, discrimination ceases; as discrimination ceases,  suchness is removed from intellection (<em>citta</em>)._2_ 
 
364. If a man, seeing the rise [of all things], yet perceives that  Nirvana is devoid of the faults of the philosophers, this is the Nirvana  as held by the wise, because of its not being annihilation. 
 
365. To realise this is said by myself and [other] Buddhas to be [the  attainment of] Buddhahood; if there is any other discrimination one is  committed to the philosophers' views. 
 
366. Nothing is born, and yet things are being born; nothing dies and  yet things are passing away; (<a name="312"><strong>312</strong></a>) all over  millions of worlds what is seen simultaneously is like a lunar  reflection in water. 
 
367. Unity being transformed into plurality, rain falls and fire  burns; as a mind is changed into [many] thoughts, they declare that  there is Mind-only. 
 
368. Mind is of Mind-only, no-mind is also born of Mind; when  understood varieties of forms and appearances are of Mind-only. 
 
369. By assuming Buddha[-forms], Sravaka-forms,  Pratyekabuddha-appearances, and varieties of other forms, they declare  Mind-only. 
 
_1_ The text as it stands is difficult to understand. I  follow T'ang._2_ <em> </em> Cf. Chapter III, verses 25, and the  "Sagathakam," verse 651. 
 
370. For the sake of beings [the Buddhas] show forms by means of  no-form, from the world of no-form and of form down to the hells where  hell-dwellers are; and all this originates from Mind-only. 
 
371. When a [spiritual] revulsion [takes place in them], they will  attain the Samadhi called Maya-like, the will-body, the ten stages, the  self-mastery. 
 
372. On account of self-discrimination which causes errors and sets  false reasonings in motion, the ignorant are bound up with ideas in what  they see, hear, think, or understand. 
 
373. (Chapter II, verse 197.) 
 
374. (Chapter II, verse 198.) 
 
(<a name="313"><strong>313</strong></a>) 375-378. (Chapter II, verses 199-202.) 
 
379. The Buddhas in [every] land are those of transformation, where  [the doctrine of] the one vehicle and the triple vehicle is taught; I  never enter into Nirvana, for all things are empty being devoid of birth  [and death]. 
 
380. There are thirty-six different Buddhas, and in each ten  different ones; in accordance with the thought of all beings they share  their lands. 
 
381. When existence is discriminated there are varieties of  appearances; in like manner the Dharma-Buddha's world may appear in its  multiplicity, which in reality exists not. 
 
382. The Dharma-Buddha is the true Buddha and the rest are his  transformations; according to a continuous flow of their own seeds,  sentient beings see their Buddha-forms._1_ 
 
383. When [the mind is] bound up with error and appearance,  discrimination is set in motion; (<a name="314"><strong>314</strong></a>) suchness  is no other than discrimination and discrimination is no other than  appearance. 
 
384. The Self-nature Buddha, the Enjoyment Buddha, the Transformation  Buddha, the five Transformation Buddhas, and a group of thirty-six  Buddhas—they are all of the Self-nature Buddha._2_ 
 
_1_ After T'ang and Wei. 
 
_2_ The five transformation bodies (<em>pancanirmita</em>) may  mean those transformation Buddhas who manifest themselves in the five  (sometimes six) paths of existence in order to save the sentient beings  that are suffering there in the endless wheel of transformation.  According to the Shingon doctrine of the fourfold Dharmakaya, this last  transformation or manifestation is distinguished from the generally  accepted transformation-Buddha and is given a special position by  itself. The fourth one thus in the Shingon is known as the  Nishyandakaya, distinguishing it from the third which is Nirmana- or  Nirmita-kaya. This verse is quoted by Amoghavajra (704-774), one of the  Indian Shingon Fathers, who settled in China, in one of his works called  略述金剛頂瑜伽分別聖位修證法門經 (<a href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/cbeta/result/taisho.htm">the Taisho  Tripitaka</a>, <a href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/cbeta/result/T18/T18n0870.htm">No. 870</a>;  <a href="http://www.kanji.zinbun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/%7Ewittern/can/can2/ind/nannridx.htm">Nanjo  Catalogue</a>, No. 1433).

385-(<a name="315"><strong>315</strong></a>-<a name="316"><strong>316</strong></a>)-406.  (Chapter II, verses 101-123, with verse-divisions occasionally varying.) 
 
407. Owing to seeds of habit-energy [that grow from the recognition]  of an outer world, discrimination takes place; and thereby the  relativity aspect_1_ is grasped, and that which is grasped is  variously imagined._2_ 
 
(<a name="317"><strong>317</strong></a>) 408. When one depending upon the mind  recognises an external world, error is produced; error takes place from  these two [causes], and there is no third cause. 
 
409. Depending on that and from that cause error is produced; the six  (<em>indryas</em>), the twelve (<em>ayatanas</em>), the eighteen (<em>dhatus</em>),  are thus said by me to be of the Mind. 
 
410. [When it is understood that things are because of] the  combination of self-seeds and an external world (<em>grahya</em>), the  ego-attachment is abandoned. 
 
411. Because of the Alayavijnana the Vijnana[-system] is evolved;  because of inner support there is something externally appearing. 
 
412. The unintelligent imagine the Samskrita and Asamskrita to be  permanent, while they are not, as they are like the stars, a hair-net,  an echo, or things seen in a dream. 
 
413. [As they are] like the city of the Gandharvas, a mirage, or  Maya; they are not, yet they are perceived [as if they were real]; so is  the relativity aspect of existence (<em>paratantra</em>). 
 
414. By means of a triple mentality I teach the self, senses, and  their behaviour; but the Citta, Manas, and Vijnana are devoid of  self-nature. 
 
_1_ <em>Tantram</em> = <em>paratantram</em>. 
 
_2_ <em>Kalpitam</em> = <em>parikalpitam</em>. 
 
415. The Citta, Manas, and Vijnana, the twofold egolessness, the five  Dharmas, the [three] Svabhavas, — these belong to the realm of the  Buddhas. 
 
416. Habit-energy as cause is one, but as far as form (<em>lakshana</em>)  goes it is triple; (<a name="318"><strong>318</strong></a>) this is the way in  which a picture of one colour appears variously on the wall. 
 
417. The twofold egolessness, the Citta, Manas, and Vijnana, the five  Dharmas, the [three] Svabhavas—they do not belong to my essence._1_ 
 
418. When the Citta-form is put aside, the Manas and Vijnana removed,  and the [five] Dharmas, and the [three] Svabhavas abandoned, then one  attains the essence of Tathagatahood. 
 
419. The pure [essence of Tathagatahood] is not obtained by body,  speech, and thought; the essence of Tathagatahood <em>(gotram tathagatam) </em> being pure is devoid of doings. 
 
420. To be pure by means of the psychic faculties, and the  self-mastery, to be embellished with the Samadhis and the powers, to be  provided with varieties of the will-body—these belong to the pure  essence of Tathagatahood. 
 
421. To be undefiled in inner realisation, to be released from cause  and form (<em>hetulakshana</em>), to attain the eighth stage and the  Buddha-stage—this is the essence of Tathagatahood. 
 
422. The Far-Going, the Good-Wisdom, the Law-Cloud, and the  Tathagata-stage—they belong to the essence of Buddhahood, while the rest  are taken up by the two vehicles. 
 
423. Since sentient beings are differentiated as to their mentality  and individuality, the Buddhas who have achieved self-mastery over their  minds teach the ignorant the seven stages. 
 
424. At the seventh stage no faults arise as to body, speech, and  thought; at the eighth, the final abode [of consciousness], it seems to  him like having crossed a great river in a dream. 
 
_1_ <em>Gotra</em>, lit."family." 
 
(<a name="319"><strong>319</strong></a>) 425. At the fifth and the eighth stage  the Bodhisattvas acquire proficiency in mechanical arts and philosophy  and attain kingship in the triple world. 
 
426. Birth and no-birth, emptiness and no-emptiness, self-nature and  no-self-nature, —these are not discriminated [by the knowing one]; in  Mind-only [no such things] obtain. 
 
427. To discriminate, saying "This is true, this is true, this is  false," is teaching meant for the Sravakas and Pratyekabuddhas, and not  for the sons of the Buddha. 
 
428. There is neither being-and-non-being, nor the aspect of  momentariness, there are neither thought-constructions (<em>prajnapti</em>)  nor substances (<em>dravya</em>); nothing obtains in Mind-only. 
 
429. According to conventional truth (<em>samvriti</em>), things are,  but not in the highest truth; to be confused in things not having  self-nature—this belongs to conventional truth. 
 
430. I establish thought-constructions where all things are  non-existent; whatever expressions and experiences that belong to the  ignorant are not of the truth as it is (<em>tattva</em>). 
 
431. Things born of words seem to belong to an objective realm; but  when it is perceived that they are born of words, they become  non-existent. 
 
432. As no pictures are separable from the wall, no shadow from the  post, so are no [Vijnana-]waves stirred when the Alaya[-ocean] is pure  [and quiet]. 
 
433. (Chapter VI, verse 4.) 
 
(<a name="320"><strong>320</strong></a>) 434. It is taught that from the  Dharma[-Buddha] comes the Nishyanda, and from the Nishyanda the Nirmita;_1_ these are the original Buddhas, the rest are transformed bodies. 
 
435-436. (Chapter II, verses 125-126.) 
 
437. <span style="color: blue;">(Chapter II, verses 123 and 129.)</span> 
 
438-439. (Chapter II, verses 127-128.) 
 
440. Do not discriminate, saying "Here is emptiness," or saying  again, "Here is no emptiness"; both being and non-being are merely  imagined, for there is no reality corresponding to the imagined. 
 
_1_ After T'ang. 
 
441.  The ignorant imagine that things originate from the  accumulation of qualities, or atoms, or substances; but there is not a  single atom in existence, and, therefore, there is no external world. 
 
442. Forms seen as external are due to the imagination of people,  they are nothing but the Mind itself; (<a name="321"><strong>321</strong></a>)  there is nothing to be seen externally, and, therefore, there is no  external world. 
 
443-444. <span style="color: blue;">(Chapter III, verses 157-158.)</span> 
 
445-447. (Chapter II, verses 205-207.) 
 
448. (Chapter II, verse 209.) 
 
449. (Chapter II, verse 208.) 
 
450. (Chapter II, verse 210.) 
 
(<a name="322"><strong>322</strong></a>) 451. As the elephant who is immersed  in deep mud is unable to move about, so the Sravakas, who are deeply  intoxicated with the liquor of Samadhi, stand still. 
 
452. <span style="color: blue;">(Chapter  II, verse 135.)</span> 
 
453. Space, the hare's horns, and a barren woman's child are  unrealities, and yet they are spoken of [as if real]; so are all things  imagined. 
 
454. The world originates from habit-energy, there is nothing  whatever to be designated as being and non-being, nor is there its  negation; those who see into this are emancipated, as they understand  the egolessness of things. 
 
455. [Of the three Svabhavas] one is Parikalpita, mutuality is  Paritantra, and suchness is Parinishpanna; this is always taught by me  in the sutra. 
 
456. (Chapter II, verse 172.) 457-458. (Chapter II, verses 203-204.) 
 
459. The Citta, discrimination, thought-construction, Manas, Vijnana,  (<a name="323"><strong>323</strong></a>) the Alaya, all that which sets the  triple world in motion, are synonyms of Mind. 
 
460. Life, warmth, the Vijnana, the Alaya, the vital principle,  Manas, Manovijnana, —these are the names for discrimination. 
 
461. The body is maintained by the Citta, the Manas always  cognitates, the [Mano-]vijnana together with the Vijnanas cuts the world  in pieces as objects of Citta. 
 
462-464. <span style="color: blue;">(Chapter II, verses 3-5.)</span> 
 
465-469 (<a name="324"><strong>324</strong></a>). (Chapter II, verses 15-19.) 
 
470-471. (Chapter III, verses 7-8.) 
 
472. [Some say that] an ego-soul really is, which is separate from  the Skandha-appearance, or that the Skandhas really exist; [but] there  is after all no ego-soul in them. 
 
473. When one's doings, together with the passions primary and  secondary, are brought to light, one perceives the world to be the Mind  itself and is released from all sufferings. 
 
474-487 (<a name="325"><strong>325</strong></a>-<a name="326"><strong>326</strong></a>). <span style="color: blue;">(Chapter II,  verses 20-33.)</span> 
 
488. The extinction-knowledge attained by the Sravakas, the birth of  the Buddhas, and [that] of the Pratyekabuddhas and Bodhisattvas—all  takes place by getting rid of the passions. 
 
489. No external forms are in existence, what is external is what is  seen of the Mind itself; as the ignorant fail to understand as regards  the Mind itself, they imagine the Samskrita [as real]. 
 
490. The insight that pluralities are of the Mind itself is withheld  from the bewildered who, not knowing what the nature of the external  world is, are under bondage to [the idea] of causation, and the fourfold  proposition. 
 
491.  There are no reasons, no statements, no illustrations, no  syllogistic members to the intelligent who know that the external world  is the reflection of their own Mind. 
 
492. Do not discriminate by discrimination, to discriminate is  characteristic of the Parikalpita (imagination); depending on the  imagination, discrimination is evolved. 
 
493. One's habit-energy is the origin [of all things] which are  mutually and uninterruptedly knitted together; (<a name="327"><strong>327</strong></a>)  as dualism is [primarily] external to people's minds, there is no  rising of it. 
 
494.  Because of mind and what belongs to it, there is  discrimination, [the ignorant] are comfortably established in the triple  world; that an external world of appearances is evolved is due to the  discrimination of self-nature. 
 
495. Because of the combination of appearances and seeds there are  the twelve Ayatanas; because of the combination of subject and object,_1_ I talk of doings. 
 
496. Like images in a mirror, like a hair-net, to the dim-eyed, the  mind to the ignorant is seen enveloped in habit-energy. 
 
497. Discrimination goes on in the world imagined by  self-discrimination; but there is no external world as it is  discriminated by the philosophers. 
 
498. Like the ignorant who not recognising the rope take it for a  snake, people imagine an external world, not knowing that it is of Mind  itself. 
 
499. Thus the rope in its own nature is neither the one nor the  other; but owing to the fault of not recognising Mind itself, people go  on with their discrimination over the rope. 
 
500-501. (Chapter III, verses 82-83.) 
 
(<a name="328"><strong>328</strong></a>) 502. While the imagined is being  imagined, the imagination itself has no reality; seeing that  discrimination has no reality, how does it [really] take place? 
 
503. Form (<em>rupam</em>, or matter) has no reality of its own, as is  the case with a jar, a garment, etc.; in the world, however, which has  no real existence, discrimination is carried on. 
 
504. If people discriminate erroneously regarding the Samskrita since  the beginningless past, how is the self-nature of beings an error? Pray  tell me, O Muni. 
 
505. The nature of all beings is non-existent, and what is seen [as  external] is nothing but the Mind; when the Mind itself is not perceived  discrimination is evolved. 
 
506. When it is said that there are no such things imagined as the  ignorant imagine, it means that there is something which is not  recognised by the intellect. 
 
507. If it is said that something exists with the wise, this is not  what is discriminated by the ignorant; if the wise and the ignorant walk  the same way, that which [is real] with the wise must be a falsehood. 
 
_1_ <em>asraya</em> and <em>alambana</em>, depended and  depending. 
 
508. To the wise there is nothing erroneous, therefore their mind is  undefiled; the ignorant whose mind is uninterruptedly defiled goes on  imagining the imagined. 
 
509. It is like the mother who fetches for her child a fruit from the  air, saying, "O son, don't cry, pick the fruit, there are so many of  them." 
 
510.  In like manner I make all beings covet varieties of imagined  fruit (<a name="329"><strong>329</strong></a>) whereby I [lead them to] the truth  that goes beyond the antithesis of being and non-being. 
 
511. The being [which is realised by the wise] having never been in  existence is not united with causation; it is primarily unborn and yet  born, while its essence is not obtainable._1_ 
 
512. The unobtainable essence (<em>alabdhatmaka</em>) is indeed unborn,  and yet it is nowhere separated from causation; nor are things as they  are for this moment anywhere separated from causation. 
 
513. When the visible world is thus approached, it is anywhere  neither existent nor non-existent, nor is it  not-existent-and-non-existent; putting itself under causation, reality  is not the subject of discrimination to the wise. 
 
514. The philosophers cherishing wrong ideas and the ignorant have  theories of oneness and otherness; they understand not that the world,  subject to causation, is like Maya and a dream. 
 
515. The supreme Mahayana is beyond the realm of words, its meaning  is well elucidated by me, but the ignorant do not comprehend. 
 
516. [The doctrines] thus advanced by the Sravakas and philosophers  are tainted with jealousy; they go astray from reality, because their  doctrines are false theorisings. 
 
517. Appearance, self-nature, form (<em>samsthanam</em>), and name,  —depending on these four conditions all kinds of imagination are carried  on. 
 
_1_ The meaning of this and what follow is this: there is an  absolute being which precludes all form of qualification, but without  which this world of cause and effect is impossible; the absolute is thus  in one sense unobtainable, and yet in another sense it is the reason of  this existence subject to causation. 
 
518. Those who believe in the oneness or the manyness [of cause],  those who imagine Brahma god or the authority of Isvara, (<a name="330"><strong>330</strong></a>)  those who take the sun and the moon for an element—they are not my  sons._1_ 
 
519. Those who are equipped with a noble insight and are thoroughly  conversant with the suchness of reality, know well how to turn over  ideas and reach the other shore of the Vijnana. 
 
520. This is the seal of emancipation belonging to those sons who  [have embraced] my teaching; it is released from existence and  non-existence, removed from coming and going. 
 
521. If karma disappears by causing a transformation in the world of  matter (<em>rupa</em>) and the Vijnanas, permanence and impermanence no  more obtain, and transmigration ceases. 
 
522. When this transformation takes place, the idea of matter is  shaken off, space-relations are banished, but karma released from the  fault of being and non-being abides with the Alaya. 
 
523. While matter and Vijnanas pass into annihilation, karma abides  with the being of the Alaya which is not destroyed, whereby there is the  union of matter and Vijnanas. 
 
524. If people's karma which is in combination with them is  destroyed, karma-succession being thus destroyed, there will be no  transmigration, no attainment of Nirvana. 
 
525. If karma is destroyed together with matter and Vijnanas, and yet  is subject to transmigration, matter will then subsist as it differs in  no way from karma. 
 
526. Mind (<em>citta</em>) and matter are neither different nor  not-different from discrimination; there is no distinction of all things  as they are removed from being and non-being. 
 
(<a name="331"><strong>331</strong></a>) 527. The Parikalpita and the  Paratantra are mutually dependent and are not to be differentiated; thus  with matter and impermanency, they are mutually conditioning. 
 
<div>_1_ The whole verse is not at all clear.</div> 
 
528. Apart from oneness and otherness the [Pari-]kalpita is not  knowable; so with, matter and impermanency; how can one speak of their  being and non-being? 
 
529. When the Parikalpita is thoroughly understood [as to its  nature], the Paratantra is not born; when the Paratantra is understood,  the Parikalpita becomes suchness. 
 
530. When the Parikalpita is destroyed my Dharma-eye (<em>netri</em>)_1_ is destroyed; and there takes place within my teaching [the controversy  of] assertion and negation. 
 
531. In this way, then, and at that time, there will rise disparagers  of the Dharma, none of whom are worth talking with as they are  destroyers of my Dharma-eye. 
 
532. As they are not taken into the company of the intelligent, they  abandon the life of the Bhikshu; and as they destroy the Parikalpita,  they are engaged in controversies asserting and negating. 
 
533. As their insight is bound up with being and non-being, what  appears to their imagination resembles a hairnet, Maya, a dream, the  Gandharva's city, a mirage, etc. 
 
534. He who studies under the Buddhas may not live together with  those who cherish dualism and are destroyers of others. 
 
535. But if there are Yogins who see a being separated from the  imagination (<a name="332"><strong>332</strong></a>) and released from existence  and non-existence, he [i. e. a Buddhist] may associate with them [i. e.  such Yogins]. 
 
536. It is like a mine in the earth producing gold and precious  stones; it harbours no cause of strife in it, and yet it furnishes  people with various means of subsistence. 
 
537. Likewise, though the essence (<em>gotra</em>)_2_ of all  beings appears various, it has nothing to do with karma; as the visible  world is non-existent, there is no karma, nor is the path born of karma. 
 
538. As is understood by the wise, all things have no self-being, but  according to the discriminations of the ignorant things appear to  exist.

539. If things are not existent as discriminated by the ignorant, all  things being non-existent, there are no defilements for any one. 
 
540. Because of varieties of defilement cherished by beings there is  transmigration, and the sense-organs are completed; being bound up by  ignorance and desire there is the evolution of beings possessed of a  body. 
 
541. If beings are not existent as discriminated by the ignorant,  there will be no evolving of the sense-organs in these beings, which is  not the Yogin's [view]. 
 
542. If beings themselves are not and yet they become the cause of  transmigration, then there will be an emancipation which is independent  of people's strivings. 
 
543. If beings are non-existent to you, how can there be any  distinction between the wise and the ignorant? Nor will there be  anything characterising the wise who are disciplining themselves for the  triple emancipation. 
 
(<a name="333"><strong>333</strong></a>) 544. The Skandhas, personal soul,  doctrines, individuality and generality, no-signs, causation, and senses  —of these I talk for the sake of the Sravakas. 
 
545. No-cause, Mind-only, the powers (<em>vibhuti</em>), the stages [of  Bodhisattvahood], the inner realisation, pure suchness—of these I talk  for the sake of the Bodhisattvas. 
 
546. In the time to come there will be disparagers of my teaching  who, putting on the Kashaya robe, will talk about being-and-non-being  and its works. 
 
547. Things born of causation are non-existent—this is the realm of  the wise; a thing imagined has no reality, yet things are imagined by  the theorisers. 
 
548. In the time to come there will be [a class of ignorant people  headed by] Kanabhuj; they will talk about the non-existence of work, and  will ruin the people with their evil theories. 
 
549. The world is originated from atoms, atoms are causeless, and  there are nine permanent substances—such evil theories they teach. 
 
550. [They say that] substances are produced by substances, and so  qualities by qualities; and they destroy the self-being of all things  [saying that] it is another being. 
 
551. If it is said that originally the world was not and then  evolved, it must have had a beginning; but my statement is that there is  no primary limit to transmigration. 
 
(<a name="334"><strong>334</strong></a>) 552. If all the innumerable things in  the triple world were not and then evolved, nobody would doubt if horns  grow on a bitch, or a she-camel, or a donkey. 
 
553. If the eye, form (<em>rupa</em>), and Vijnana were not and now  they are, straw-mats, crowns, cloth, etc. would be produced from lumps  of clay. 
 
554. A straw-mat is not found in cloth, nor cloth in a straw matting;  why is it that by some combination anything is not produced from any  other thing? 
 
555. That life and the body so called were not and then evolved; all  such controversies as this have been declared by me [as untrue]. 
 
556. The statement has been made first [against the philosophers] and  their views are warded off; their views being warded off, I will make  my own statement. 
 
557. While I [first] make a statement in behalf of the philosophical  systems, let not my disciples be disturbed by [my] drawing on the  dualism of being and non-being. 
 
558. That the world is born of a supreme soul and that changes are  due to the qualities, —this is what the school of <span style="color: blue;">Kapita</span> teaches its disciples; but it is not  the right way of thinking. 
 
559. There is no reality, no non-reality, nor is there any [world of]  causation conditioned by causation; as there is nothing to be  characterised as causation, non-reality never has its rise. 
 
560. My statement is free from the alternatives of being and  non-being, is removed from cause and condition, has nothing to do with  birth and destruction, and is removed from qualified [and qualifying]. 
 
561. When the world is regarded as like Maya and a dream, exempt from  cause and condition, (<a name="335"><strong>335</strong></a>) and eternally  causeless, there is no rising of imagination. 
 
562. When existence is always regarded as resembling the Gandharva's  [city], a mirage, a hair-net, and as free from the alternatives of being  and non-being, removed from cause and condition, and causeless, then  the mind flows clear of defilements. 
 
563. [The philosophers may say that] if there is no external reality,  Mind-only too will be non-existent; how can Mind exist without  objective reality? The [doctrine of] Mind-only_1_ [therefore]  is untenable. 
 
564. [Further they may say that] on account of an objective world of  realities, people's minds are aroused; how can there be a mind without a  cause? [The doctrine of] Mind-only_1_ is [therefore]  untenable. 
 
565. But suchness and Mind-only_1_ are realities belonging  to the teaching of the wise; neither those who deny nor those who affirm  comprehend my teachings. 
 
566. If a mind is said to evolve on account of perceived and  perceiving, this is the mind that is of the world; then the Mind-only  obtains not. 
 
567. When it is said that there is something resembling body,  property, and abode produced in a dream-like manner, a mind, indeed, is  seen under the aspect of duality; but Mind itself is not dualistic. 
 
568. As a sword cannot cut itself, or as a finger cannot touch its  own tip, Mind cannot see itself. 
 
569. In the state of imagelessness there is no reality, no  Parikalpita, no Paratantra, no five Dharmas, no twofold mind._2_ 
 
(<a name="336"><strong>336</strong></a>) 570. The dualism of giving-birth and  being-born belongs to the nature of things; when I speak of the  giving-birth of things that have no self-nature, it is on account of a  hidden meaning. 
 
571. If multiplicities of forms are born of imagination, there will  be something of objectivity in [the notion of] space, in [that of] a  hare's horns. 
 
_1_ For these <em>cittamatra</em>, T'ang has 唯 識 instead of 唯心. Ordinarily 唯識 is for <em>vijnanamatra</em> or <em>vijnaptimatra</em>,  and not for <em>cittamatra</em>. In this respect Wei is consistent, for  it has 唯心 throughout. 
 
_2_ After T'ang. 
 
572. When an objective reality is of mind, this reality does not  belong to imagination; but reality born of imagination is something  other than mind and is unobtainable. 
 
573. In a transmigration that has no beginning, an objective world  nowhere obtains; when there is no nourishing mind, where can an  objective semblance take its rise? 
 
574. If there is any growth from nothingness, horns will grow on a  hare; let no discrimination take place, thinking that something grows  out of nothing. 
 
575. As there is nothing existing now, so there was nothing existing  previously; where there is no objective world, how can a mind which is  bound up with an objective world take its rise? 
 
576. Suchness, emptiness, [reality-]limit, Nirvana, the Dharmadhatu,  no-birth of all things, self-being—these characterise the highest truth. 
 
577.  The ignorant, who cherish [the notion of] being and non-being,  by imagining causes and conditions, are unable to understand that all  things are causeless and unborn. 
 
578. The Mind is manifested; there is no objective world of  pluralities whose cause is in the beginningless past; (<a name="337"><strong>337</strong></a>)  if there is no objective world since the beginningless past, how does  individualisation_1_ ever come to exist? 
 
579. If anything grows from nothingness, the poor will become rich;  when there is no objective world, how can a mind be born? Pray tell me, O  Muni. 
 
580.  As all this is causeless, there is neither mind nor objective  world; as the mind is not born, the triple world is devoid of doings. 
 
581-613 (<a name="338"><strong>338</strong></a>-<a name="341"><strong>341</strong></a>).  (Chapter III, verses 86-117.) 
 
614. The statement that a hare has no horns is made out of the  reasonings concerning a jar, a garment, a crown, and a horn; where there  is no complete cause, there is no [real] existence; thus you should  know. 
 
_1_ According to T'ang, <em>visesha</em> here is evidently <em>citta</em>. 
 
615. There is non-existence when proof of existence [is produced];  non-existence does not prove non-existence; existence, indeed, looks for  non-existence, they look for each other and are mutually conditioned. 
 
616. If it is thought, again, that something appears depending on  something else, the something thus depended upon must be causeless, but  there is nothing that is causeless. 
 
617. If [it is said that] there is another reality which is depended  on, then this must have still another [reality to depend on]; this is  committing the fault of non-finality; may it not end in reaching  nowhere? 
 
618. Depending on leaves, pieces of wood, etc., the magical charm is  effected; in like manner, pluralities of objects depending on some  [other] objects are manifested to the people. 
 
619. The magical net is neither the leaves nor the pieces of wood,  nor the pebbles; (<a name="342"><strong>342</strong></a>) it is owing to the  magician that the magic scene is perceived by the people. 
 
620. Thus when something [of magic] depending on some objects is  destroyed, dualism ceases at the moment of seeing; how will there be  anything of discrimination? 
 
621. The discriminated by discrimination exist not, and  discrimination itself does not obtain; discrimination being thus  unobtainable, there is neither transmigration nor Nirvana. 
 
622. Discrimination now being unobtainable, it is not aroused;  discrimination not being aroused, how can a mind rise? Mind-only then is  not tenable. 
 
623. When thought is divided into many, the teaching lacks in  validity; and owing to the absence of validity, there is no  emancipation, nor is there multitudinousness of objects. 
 
624. There is no such objective world as is discriminated by the  ignorant; when the Mind goes astray on account of habit-energy, it  manifests itself like images. 
 
625. All things are unborn and have nothing to do with being and  non-being: all is nothing but Mind and is delivered from discrimination. 
 
626. For the ignorant things are said to be causal, but not for the  wise; when the self-nature of Mind is liberated, it becomes pure where  the wise have their abode. 
 
627. Thus, the Samkhya, the Vaiseshika, the naked philosophers, the  Brahmin theologians, followers of Siva, (<a name="343"><strong>343</strong></a>)  cherishing views based on being and non-being, are destitute of the  truth of solitude. 
 
628. Having no self-nature, being unborn, being empty, being like  Maya, being free from defilements—to whom is this taught by the Buddhas  as well as by yourself? 
 
629. For the sake of the Yogins who are pure in mind, spiritual  discipline (<em>yoga</em>) is taught by the Buddhas who are free from  theories and speculations, and such is also proclaimed by me. 
 
630. If all this is the Mind, where does the world stand? Why are men  seen coming and going on earth? 
 
631. As a bird moves in the air according to its fancy without  abiding anywhere, without depending on anything, as if moving on earth; 
 
632. So people with all their discrimination move along, walk about  in the Mind itself like a bird moving in the air._1_ 
 
633. Tell me how something looking like body, property, and abode  rises from the Mind. How does appearance take its rise? Why is  Mind-only? Pray tell me. 
 
634. Body, property, and abode are appearances and their rise is due  to habit-energy; appearances are born of irrationality (<em>ayukta</em>),  their rise is due to discrimination. 
 
635. Objectivity discriminated makes the world, a mind takes its rise  from [recognising] objectivity; when it is clearly perceived that what  is seen is the Mind itself, discrimination ceases. 
 
(<a name="344"><strong>344</strong></a>) 636. When discrimination is seen [as  to its true nature, it is noticed that] name and sense are to be  disjoined (<em>visamyukta</em>),_2_ then both knowledge and  knower will be discarded, and one is released of the Samskrita. 
 
_1_ This means that in spite of our discriminations and  imaginings we cannot get away from the control of Mind-only, which is,  religiously expressed, Amitabha Buddha pursues sentient beings, as is  taught in Shin Buddhism, in spite of their struggle to run away from his  all-embracing love. Thus interpreted, this verse gives us a new outlook  in the philosophy of the <em>Lankavatara</em>. 
 
_2_ This is the reading of T'ang. 
 
637.  To abandon both name and sense, this is the way of all the  Buddhas;_1_ those who wish to get enlightened in any other way  will not attain enlightenment for themselves, nor for others. 
 
638. (Chapter VI, verse 5.) 
 
639. When the world is seen detached from knowledge and knowability,  there is no meaning to it, and discrimination ceases to go forth. 
 
640. By seeing into [the nature of] Mind there is the cessation of  discrimination as regards works and words; by not seeing into [the true  nature of] Self-mind, discrimination evolves. 
 
641. Four of the Skandhas are formless (<em>arupina</em>), they cannot  be numbered; the elements differ from one another, how can they produce  such pluralities of forms (<em>rupa</em>)? 
 
642. When [the notion of] individuality is abandoned, we have no  elements, primary and secondary; if [we say that] form is produced by  other qualities, why not by the Skandhas?_2_ 
 
643. When one is emancipated from the Ayatanas and Skandhas, seeing  them as free of individual signs, then the mind is liberated because of  seeing the egolessness of things. 
 
(<a name="345"><strong>345</strong></a>) 644. From the differentiation of an  objective world and the senses, the Vijnana is set in motion in eight  ways; thus the aspects [of self-nature]_3_ are three, but when  imagelessness obtains they all cease. 
 
645. When dualism is cherished, the Alaya sets up in the Manas the  consciousness of an ego and its belongings, and the Vijnanas; when this  is penetratingly perceived, they all subside. 
 
646. When the immovable is seen, oneness and otherness being  discarded, then there will be no more discriminating of the two, ego and  its belongings. 
 
_1_ Read after T'ang. The Sanskrit text is too obscure for  intelligent reading. 
 
_2_ Not clear. 
 
_3_ That is, Svabhavalakshana. 
 
647. Nothing evolving, there is no growth, nor is there any cause to  set the Vijnanas in action; work and cause being removed, there is  cessation and nothing is aroused. 
 
648. Pray tell me the why of discrimination, of Mind-only, and of the  world. Why is the world said to be disjoined from causes, discarding  qualified and qualifying? 
 
649. The Mind is seen as manifold when visible forms are  discriminated; as it is not clearly perceived that what is seen is of  the Mind, there is something other than the Mind, because [the dualism  of] a mind and an external world is clung to. 
 
650. When [the world] is not understood with intelligence there is  nihilism; [but] the Mind being asserted, how is it that this does not  give rise to realism (<em>astitva-drishti</em>)? 
 
651. Discrimination is neither existent nor nonexistent, therefore,  realism does not arise; as it is clearly understood that what is seen is  of Mind-only, no discrimination is set to work. 
 
652. Discrimination not rising, there is a turning-back (<em>paravritti</em>),  and there is no dependence on anything; (<a name="346"><strong>346</strong></a>)  when things are regarded as subject to causation, the fourfold  proposition obstructs [the way of truth]. 
 
653. Different expressions are distinguished but none is verifiable;  in all these there is a necessary implication which rises from the  notion of a primary causal agency._1_ 
 
654. By maintaining the combination of causes and conditions, a  primary causal agency is warded off; when a chain of causes is held to  be impermanent, the fault of permanency is avoided. 
 
655. There is neither birth nor destruction where the ignorant see  impermanency; nothing is ever destroyed, what is seen [as real] is due  to [the idea of] a causal agency. _2 _How is the unseen [born]?  By what does the impermanent world come into existence? 
 
656. (Second line only, <span style="color: blue;">Chapter III, verse 62.</span>) 
 
_1_ Not quite clear. 
 
_2_ In the Sanskrit text this line is made to belong to the  next verse, which is wrong. 
 
657-662 (<a name="347"><strong>347</strong></a>). (Chapter III, verses 62-68.) 
 
663. The gods, the Asuras, mankind, the animals, hungry ghosts, and  Yama's abode—these six paths of existence are enumerated, where sentient  beings are born. 
 
664. According to one's karma, be it superior, inferior, or middling,  one is born in these [six] paths; guarding all that is good, [one will  attain] an excellent emancipation. 
 
665. The company of the Bhikshus is taught by you that there is birth  and death at every moment; pray tell me its meaning. 
 
666. As one form changes into another, so is the mind born and broken  up; thence I tell my disciples how uninterruptedly and momentarily  birth- [and-death] takes place. 
 
667. In like manner discrimination also rises and disappears with  every single form; where there is discrimination, there are living  beings; outside of it there are no living beings. 
 
668. At every moment there is a disjunction, this is called  causation; (<a name="348"><strong>348</strong></a>) when one is liberated from the  notion of form (<em>rupa</em>), there is neither birth nor death. 
 
669. When dualism is upheld, there rise causation-born and  no-causation-born, ignorance and suchness, etc.; not to be dualistic is  suchness. 
 
670. When causation[-born] and no-causation-born [are distinguished],  things are differentiated, there are permanency, etc., there are  effect, cause, and causation. 
 
671. As long as the notion of cause and effect is upheld, there is no  difference between the philosophers; this is your teaching as well as  that of [other] Buddhas; O Mahamuni, such are not the wise ones. 
 
672. Within the body, measuring one vyana,_1_ there is a  world; the cause of its rising, the attaining of cessation, and the path  (<em>pratipad</em>)—this I teach to sons of the Victor. 
 
673. By clinging to the three Svabhavas, perceived [or grasped] and  perceiving [or grasping] are manifested; the simple-minded discriminate  objects as belonging to the world and to the super-world. 
 
_1_ The measure of two extended arms. 
 
674. From the viewpoint of relativity the notion of Svabhava has been  upheld, but in order to ward off one-sided views the Svabhava is not to  be discriminated. 
 
675. As faults and defects are sought, the principle is not  established, nor is the mind [properly] set to work; this is due to the  rising of dualistic notions; non-duality is suchness. 
 
(<a name="349"><strong>349</strong></a>) 676. [If one should think that] the  Vijnana, etc. are originated by ignorance, desire, and karma, this is  wrong, for the fault of non-finality is committed; this being committed,  the rise of the world becomes impossible. 
 
677. The fourfold destruction of things is told by the unenlightened;  discrimination is said to rise in two ways; [in fact,] there is no  existence, no non-existence. When one is released from the fourfold  proposition, one abandons dualism. 
 
678. Discrimination may rise in two ways, but when it is seen [in its  true nature], it will never rise [again]; for in all things not being  born there is the awakening of intelligence; but_1_ where there  is the birth of things, this is owing to discrimination; let one not  discriminate. 
 
679._2_ Pray tell me, O Lord, about the truth in order to  check dualistic views, [so that] I and others may not cherish the  [dualism of] being and non-being. 
 
680. And [thus] we may keep ourselves away from the philosophers'  teachings and also from the Sravakas and Pratyekabuddhas; for it behoves  the Bodhisattvas not to lose the life of enlightenment as realised by  the Buddhas. 
 
681. To be delivered from [the notion of] cause and no-cause, not to  be born, and being one—these are synonyms; [the ignorant] are bewildered  by them, but the wise always rise above them. 
 
_1_ That which follows forms the first half of verse 678 in  the Sanskrit text. 
 
_2_ The verse 679 here is composed of the second half of 679  and the first line of 680 in the Sanskrit text. 
 
682. All things appear like a cloud, a multitude of clouds, a  rainbow; they are like a vision, a hair-net, Maya, etc., they are born  of self-discrimination; and yet the philosophers discriminate the world  as born of a self-creating agency. 
 
683. Not being born, suchness, reality, limit, and emptiness, —these  are other names for form (<em>rupa</em>); one should not imagine it to  mean a nothing. 
 
(<a name="350"><strong>350</strong></a>) 684. In the world [another name of] <em>hasta</em> (hand) is <em>kara;</em> Indra [is also called] Sakra and Purandara; in  the same way [there are many synonyms] for this existence; and one  should not imagine it to mean a nothing. 
 
685. Emptiness is no other than form, so is no-birth; one should not  imagine anything different from this; if one does, faulty views will  follow. 
 
686. Because of objective appearances being asserted, there is  general discrimination (<em>samkalpa</em>) and particular discrimination (<em>vikalpa</em>);  because of imagination (<em>parikalpa</em>) there are long and short,  square and round, etc. 
 
687. General discrimination belongs to the Citta, imagination to the  Manas, and particular discrimination to the Manovijnana; [but reality]  is neither the qualified nor the qualifying. 
 
688. What is regarded by the philosophers as unborn is my own  teaching wrongly viewed, and [the latter is] imagined to be  indistinguishable [from theirs], but this is submitting a faulty  argument. 
 
689. Those who have acquired the knowledge of proper reasoning by  making use of [the idea of] no-birth and its meaning, are said to have  an understanding of my doctrine. 
 
690. In order to crush the philosophical views, not being born is  said to mean not having any abode; knowing what dualism means, I teach  the doctrine of no-birth. 
 
691. Are all things to be regarded as unborn, or not? Pray tell, O  Mahamuni. The doctrine of causelessness, no-birth, the rising of  existence, —all these are held by the philosophers. 
 
(<a name="351"><strong>351</strong></a>) 692._1_ I teach Mind-only  which is removed from [the dualism of] being and non-being. One should  discard [the view of] birth and no-birth which causes various  philosophical theories. 
 
_1_ The first half of this verse numbered 692 in the  Sanskrit text is evidently inserted here by mistake, and is not  translated; and the first half of the following verse is brought over  here to complete 691. The numbering, therefore, from 692 to 694 is  altered in this translation. 
 
693. In the doctrine of causelessness, of no-birth, of birth, the  notion of a causal agency [is involved] on which they depend. Effortless  deeds come from nothingness, and deeds [as ordinarily performed] are  mixed with motives. 
 
694. Tell me the [right] view that goes with skilful means, original  vows, etc.; how does the society [of the holy ones] come into existence  when all things are not? 
 
695. By separating oneself from [the dualism of] perceived and  perceiving, there is neither evolution nor cessation; the mind is born  as views are cherished as regards one existence or another. 
 
696. Things are said to be unborn, how is this? Pray tell me.  Sentient beings do not understand it, so it ought to be explained. 
 
697. Pray explain to me, O Mahamuni, all the contradictions [involved  in the statements made] before and after, to escape the errors of the  philosophers and to be released from the perverted theory of causation. 
 
698. Pray tell me, O Most Excellent of Teachers, regarding cessation  and coming back into existence, in order to be released from being and  non-being, and yet not to destroy cause and effect. 
 
699. Pray tell me as to the graded succession of the stages, O  Lotus-eyed One;_1_ for the world cherishes dualism and is  bewildered with wrong views. 
 
(<a name="352"><strong>352</strong></a>) 700. For on account of [the wrong  views concerning] birth, no-birth, etc., the cause of serenity is not  recognised, there is no society [of the holy ones] for me, and I have no  chance to discourse on the nature of being. 
 
701. There is error where dualism is maintained, but the Buddhas are  thoroughly free from dualism; all things are empty, momentary, have no  self-nature, and have never been born. 
 
_1_ <em>Padma ikshana!</em> according to T'ang. 
 
702. Discriminations are carried on by those who are enveloped by  evil theories and doctrines, but not by the Tathagatas; pray tell me  about the rise and cessation of discrimination. 
 
703. Accumulated by false reasonings, there is a combination of  varieties of appearances [and Vijnanas], whereby [each Vijnana] takes in  an objective field according to its class. 
 
704. Recognising external forms, discrimination is set in motion; as  this is understood and the meaning of reality is seen as it is, the mind  conforms itself to the nature of the wise and is no more set in motion. 
 
705. The elements being rejected, there is no birth of things, but as  the elements as appearances are always the Mind, one understands what  is meant by no-birth. 
 
706. Do not discriminate discrimination, the wise are those who are  free from discrimination; when discrimination is carried on, there is  dualism which does not lead to Nirvana. 
 
707. By the statement of no-birth, Maya is seen and destroyed; when  Maya is made to be born of no-causation, this injures the truth of the  statement. 
 
(<a name="353"><strong>353</strong></a>) 708. The mind is to be regarded as a  reflected image originating in the beginningless past; it is something  of reality but not reality itself; one should realise it truly as it is  in itself. 
 
709. The nature of birth [or existence] is like an image appearing in  a mirror, which, while it is devoid of oneness and otherness, is not  altogether non-existent. 
 
710. Like the Gandharvas' city, Maya, etc., which appear depending  upon causes and conditions, the birth of all things is not no-birth [in a  relative sense]. 
 
711. It is on account of general usage that a dualistic  discrimination is set up as regards persons and things; but this is not  clearly understood by the ignorant so that [the thought of] an ego-soul  and individual objects is cherished. 
 
712. There are five [classes of] Sravakas, the Sravakas [that is,  hearers] generally, those who are attached to the doctrine of causation,  those who are Arhats, those who are dependent upon their own power, and  those who are dependent upon [the power of] the Buddha. 
 
713.  Time-interruption, destruction, the highest reality, and  mutuality—these four are imagined as involved in the idea of  impermanency by the ignorant who are not endowed with intelligence. 
 
714.  The ignorant addicted to dualism cherish [such thoughts as]  dualities, atoms, original matter, and primary cause, and fail to  understand the means of emancipation, because they adhere to the  alternatives of being and non-being. 
 
715.  (Chapter VI, verse 3.) 
 
(<a name="354"><strong>354</strong></a>) 716. The primary elements are of  different qualities, and how can they produce_1_ this world of  matter (<em>rupa</em>)? [Each of] the elements has its own seat; what are  [regarded as] secondary elements are not made by them. 
 
717. Fire burns matter (<em>rupa</em>), the nature of water is to wet,  the wind scatters matter; how can matter be produced by the elements  [when they are of such contradicting natures]? 
 
718. The Rupa-skandha (matter) and the Vijnana (-Skandha)—there are  these two Skandhas and not five; they are different names for the  Skandhas; of this I have talked in a hundred ways. 
 
719. By the separation of mind from what belongs to it, the present  world evolves; [various] forms [of matter] are inseparably conjoined  with one another; matter is mind[-made], and is not element-made. 
 
720. Blue, etc., are to be referred to white, and white to blue;  cause and effect being produced [in the same mutual way], both being and  non-being are emptiness. 
 
721. Effect and effecting and effected, cold and heat, qualified and  qualifying, —such-like and all [other things] are not to be explained  away by theories. 
 
722. The Citta, Manas and the six Vijnanas are by nature united and  removed from oneness and otherness; they are evolved from the Alaya. 
 
_1_ After T'ang. 
 
723. The Samkhya and the Vaiseshika followers, the naked  philosophers, and the advocates of Isvara the creator, are addicted to  the dualism of being and non-being, and do not know what solitary  reality is._1_ 
 
(<a name="355"><strong>355</strong></a>) 724. Varieties of forms (<em>sansthana</em>)  and figures (<em>akriti</em>) are not produced by the primary elements;  but the philosophers declare them to originate from the elements primary  and secondary. 
 
725. As the philosophers imagine causes other than the unborn, they  do not understand, and because of stupidity they uphold the dualism of  being and non-being. 
 
726. There is a truth (<em>tattva</em>) characterised by purity; it is  united with the Citta but disunited with the Manas, etc.; it abides with  knowledge. 
 
727. If karma is form (<em>rupa</em>), it will be the cause of the  Skandhas and the objective world; beings without attachment will not be  abiding [even] in the world of formlessness. 
 
728. That egolessness is the true doctrine follows from the  non-existence of beings; the advocate of non-ego is a destroyer,_2_ causing even the cessation of the Vijnana. 
 
729. There are four abodes of it, how does it arise from the  non-existence of form? As there is nothing existent innerly or  outwardly, no Vijnanas arise. 
 
730. The theorisers wish to see the Skandhas in the middle existence;  likewise, [they wish,] a being born in the world of formlessness is of  no-form; what else is there? 
 
731. [If one says that] emancipation is attained without exerting  oneself, as there are no beings, no Vijnanas, this is no doubt a  philosopher's theory; the theorisers do not understand. 
 
732. If form is to be found in the world of formlessness, it is not  visible; (<a name="356"><strong>356</strong></a>) its non-existence contradicts  the truth, there is neither a vehicle nor a driver._3_ 
 
_1_ A repetition of verse 627. 
 
_2_ Literally, cutting off <span style="color: blue;">(<em>chela</em>)</span>. 
 
_3_ The statements about form here are not quite  intelligible. 
 
733. The Vijnana, born of habit-energy, is united with the senses;  there are eight kinds of it, they do not grasp one field all at once._1_ 
 
734. When form is not evolved, the senses are not the senses;  therefore, the Blessed One declares that the senses, etc. are  characterised with momentariness. 
 
735. How without determining form (<em>rupa</em>) can the Vijnana take  its rise? How without the rising of knowledge can transmigration take  place? 
 
736. To pass away instantly after birth, —this is not the teaching of  the Buddhas; nor is there the uninterrupted-ness of all things; as  discrimination moves about, one is born in the various paths. 
 
737. The senses and their objective worlds are meant for the stupid  but not for the wise; the ignorant grasp after names, the wise  comprehend the meaning. 
 
738. The sixth [Vijnana] is not to be understood as non-attachment,  or as attachment; the wise who are devoid of the fault of being are not  committed to a definite theory. 
 
739. Those theorisers who are without knowledge are frightened at  eternalism and nihilism; (<a name="357"><strong>357</strong></a>) the ignorant are  unable to distinguish between the Samskrita, the Asamskrita, and the  ego-soul. 
 
740. [Some imagine the ego-soul] to be one with the Citta, [others]  to be different from the Manas, etc., attachment_2_ exists in  oneness as well as in otherness._3_ 
 
741. If attachment is determined and mind and what belongs to it are  designated, how is it that on account of the attachment there is the  determination by oneness?_4_ 
 
_1_ Not clear. 
 
_2_ <em>Dana</em> evidently stands here for <em>upadana</em>, as  is understood by T'ang. However, this and the following two or three  stanzas are difficult to understand very clearly as there are no  references in the text to the ideas discussed here. Probably they  contain allusions to the Abhidharma doctrines. 
 
_3_ Read after T'ang. 
 
_4_ This is not clear. A number of verses in these pages  that give no sense as far as we can see in their several connections are  not at all in cognation with the general thoughts of the <em>Lanka</em>.  Are they later additions taken from somewhere else? 
 
742. By reason of attachment, attainment, karma, birth, effect, etc.,  they are brought to the goal like fire; there is resemblance and  non-resemblance in the principle._1_ 
 
743. As when fire burns, the burned and the burning are  simultaneously there, so is attachment to an ego-soul; what is it that  is not seized by the theorisers? 
 
744. Whether there is birth or no-birth, the mind shines forth all  the time; what illustrations will the theorisers produce to prove their  notion of an ego-soul? 
 
745. Those theorisers who are destitute of the principle are lost in  the forest of Vijnanas; seeking to establish the theory of an ego-soul,  they wander about here and there. 
 
746. The ego (<em>atma</em>) characterised with purity is the state of  self-realisation; this is the Tathagata's womb (<em>garbha</em>) which  does not belong to the realm of the theorisers. 
 
747. When one thus knows what are the characteristics of attached and  attaching by the analysis of the Skandhas, there rises the knowledge of  the principle. 
 
(<a name="358"><strong>358</strong></a>) 748. The Alaya where the Garbha (womb)  is stationed is declared by the philosophers to be [the seat of]  thought in union with the ego; but this is not the doctrine approved [by  the Buddhas]. 
 
749. By distinctly understanding it [i. e. the doctrine] there is  emancipation and insight into the truth, and purification from the  passions which are abandoned by means of contemplation and insight. 
 
750. The Mind primarily pure is the Tathagata's Garbha which is good  but is attached to [as an ego-soul] by sentient beings; it is free from  limitation and non-limitation. 
 
751. As the beautiful colour of gold and gold among pebbles become  visible by purification, so is the Alaya among the Skandhas of a being. 
 
752. The Buddha is neither a soul nor the Skandhas, he is knowledge  free from evil outflows; clearly perceiving him to be eternally serene, I  take my refuge in him. 
 
753. The Mind, primarily pure, is with the secondary passions, with  the Manas, etc., and in union with the ego-soul—this is what is taught  by the best of speakers. 
 
_1_ Is this correct? 
 
754. The Mind is primarily pure, but the Manas, etc., are other than  that; varieties of karma are accumulated by them, and thus there are  defilements giving rise to dualism. 
 
755. The ego [primarily] pure has been defiled on account of the  external passions since the beginningless past, (<a name="359"><strong>359</strong></a>)  and what has been added from outside is like a [soiled] garment to be  washed off. 
 
756. As when a garment is cleansed of its dirt, or when gold is  removed from its impurities, they are not destroyed but remain as they  are; so is the ego freed from its defilements. 
 
757. Imagining that a melodious sound obtains in a lute, a  conch-shell, or in a kettle-drum, the unintelligent thus seek something  of an ego-soul within the Skandhas. 
 
758. As one tries to find precious stones in the treasure-house, or  in water, or underneath the ground, where they are invisible, so do  [they seek] a soul in the Skandhas. 
 
759. As the unintelligent cannot take hold of a mind and what belongs  to it as a group, and their functions which are connected with the  Skandhas, so [they cannot find] an ego-soul in the Skandhas. 
 
760. As the womb is not visible to the woman herself who has it, so  the ego-soul is not visible within the Skandhas to those who have no  wisdom. 
 
761. Like the essence of the medicinal herb, or like fire in the  kindling, those who have no wisdom do not see the ego-soul within the  Skandhas. 
 
762. Trying to find permanency and emptiness in all things, the  unenlightened cannot see them; so with the ego-soul within the Skandhas. 
 
763. When there is no true ego-soul, there are no stages, no  self-mastery, no psychic faculties, no highest anointing, no excellent  Samadhis. 
 
(<a name="360"><strong>360</strong></a>) 764. If a destroyer should come around  and say, "If there is an ego, show it to me;" a sage would declare,  "Show me your own discrimination."_1_ 
 
_1_ The statements so far made here regarding an ego-soul (<em>atman</em> or <em>pudgala</em>) as they stand seem to contradict one another, and  some really violate the Buddhist doctrine of Non-atman as far as we  know. 
 
765. Those who hold the theory of non-ego are injurers of the  Buddhist doctrines, they are given up to the dualistic views of being  and non-being; they are to be ejected by the convocation of the Bhikshus  and are never to be spoken to._1_ 
 
766. The doctrine of an ego-soul shines brilliantly like the rising  of the world-end fire, wiping away the faults of the philosophers,  burning up the forest of egolessness. 
 
767. Molasses, sugar-cane, sugar, and honey; sour milk, sesame oil,  and ghee—each has its own taste; but one who has not tasted it will not  know what it is. 
 
768. Trying to seek in five ways for an ego-soul in the accumulation  of the Skandhas, the unintelligent fail to see it, but the wise seeing  it are liberated. 
 
769. By means of illustrations furnished by the sciences, etc., the  mind is not accurately determined; as to the meaning contained in it,  how can one accurately determine it? 
 
770. Things are differentiated but the Mind is one— this is not  perceived; the theorisers [imagine it] to be causeless and  not-functioning, which is a mistake. 
 
771. When the Yogin reflects upon the mind, he does not see the Mind  in the mind; an insight comes forth from the perceived [i. e. the  world]; whence is the rising of this perceived [world]? 
 
(<a name="361"><strong>361</strong></a>) 772. I belong to the Katyayana family,  descending from the Suddhavasa; I teach the Dharma in order to lead  sentient beings to the city of Nirvana. 
 
773. This is the course of the past; I and those Tathagatas have  generally disclosed the meaning of Nirvana in three thousands of the  sutras. 
 
_1_ This and the following verse again seem to contradict  the Buddhist doctrine of non-ego. It is not easy to determine the  purport of these verses as they stand all by themselves without any  explanatory prose. In fact these verses in the Sagathakam which have no  direct connection with the main text, except those that are quite  obvious in meaning, are mostly difficult to know precisely what they  intend to signify. 
 
774. Not in the world of desire nor in [the world of] no-form is  Buddhahood attained; but at the Akanishtha in the world of form one is  awakened to Buddhahood by getting rid of greed. 
 
775. The objective world is not the cause of bondage; the cause is  bound up in the objective world; the passions are destroyed by  knowledge, which is a sharp sword gained by discipline. 
 
776. How is non-ego possible? How are things like Maya, etc.? How  about being and non-being? If suchness reveals itself to the ignorant,  how is non-ego non-existent?_1_ 
 
777. Because of things done and of things not done, the cause is not  the producer; all is unborn, and this is not clearly recognised by the  ignorant. 
 
778. The creating agencies are unborn; both the created and the  conditions of causality are unborn; why is imagination carried on as  regards creating agencies? 
 
779. The theorisers explain a cause to consist in the simultaneity of  antecedent and consequent; the birth of all things is told by means of a  light, a jar, a disciple, etc. 
 
780. The Buddhas are not Samskrita-made, but are endowed with the  marks [of excellence]; (<a name="362"><strong>362</strong></a>) they belong to the  nature of a Cakravartin; the Buddhas are not so named because of these  [marks]. 
 
781. What characterises the Buddhas is knowledge (<em>jnana</em>); it  is devoid of the defects of intellection (<em>drishti-dosha</em>); it is  an insight attained by self-realisation, it is removed from all defects. 
 
782. The religious life (<em>brahmacarya</em>) is not found in those  especially, who are deaf, blind, one-eyed, dumb, aged, young, nor in  those who are given up to the feeling of enmity. 
 
783. The world-ruler is endowed with the celestial marks and the  secondary characteristics though not manifested. They become, however,  manifested in some of the homeless monks and not in anybody else—so it  is declared. 
 
784. After the passing of the Leader of the Sakyas, these will follow  me: Vyasa, Kanada, Rishabha, Kapila, and others. 
 
<div>_1_ Is this correct reading?</div> 
 
785. Then one hundred years after my passing, Vyasa's Bharata will  appear, the Pandavas, the Kauravas, Rama, and then the Maurya. 
 
786. The Maurya, the Nanda, the Gupta, and then the Mleccha who are  bad kings; after the Mleccha will rage a warfare, and then the age of  vice; (<a name="363"><strong>363</strong></a>) and after this age of vice, the  good Dharma will no more prevail in the world. 
 
787. After passing through these ages the world will be thrown into  confusion like a wheel; fire and the sun being united, the world of  desire will be consumed. 
 
788. The heavens will again be restituted and therein the world will  take its rise, together with its four castes, kings, Rishis, and the  Dharma. 
 
789. The Vedas, worship, and charity will again prevail with the  revival of the Dharma; by narratives,_1_ histories,  prose-compositions, commentaries, annotations, thus-I-have-heard's,  etc., the world will [again] fall into confusion. 
 
790. Preparing properly-coloured cloth, have it further cleaned, have  the cloth dyed with bluish mud and cow-dung making it nondescript in  colour, so that the body may be covered with robes in every way  different from the appearance of the philosophers. 
 
791. Let the Yogin preach the doctrine, which is the badge of the  Buddhas; let him drink water filtered through a cloth and carry the  hip-string; in due time let him go about begging and keep away from  things vile. 
 
(<a name="364"><strong>364</strong></a>) 792. He will be born in a heaven  filled with light, and the other two will appear among mankind;  decorated with precious stones he will be born as a god and a  world-lord. 
 
793. In the abode of light he enjoys the four worlds by means of the  teaching based on the Dharma; but after a long reign over the worlds he  will retrograde on account of desire. 
 
794. Thus there are the golden age, the age of triads, the age of  two, and the age of vice; the Lion of the Sakyas will appear in the age  of vice, I and others in the golden age. 
 
<div>_1_ Literally, "So indeed it was."</div> 
 
795. Siddhartha of the Sakya family, Vishnu, Vyasa, Mahesvara—such  other philosophers will appear after my passing. 
 
796. There will be the teaching of the Lion of the Sakyas told in the  thus-I-have-heard's, and that of Vyasa in the narratives  (so-indeed-it-was), and the past events. 
 
797. Vishnu and Mahesvara will teach about the creation of the world;  things like this will take place after my passing. 
 
798. My mother is Vasumati, my father is the wise Prajapati; I belong  to the Katyayana family, and my name is Viraja the Victor. 
 
799. I was born in Campa, and as my father and grandfather, being  descendants of the lunar race (<em>somavamsa</em>), [my family name] is  "The Moon-Protected" (<em>somagupta</em>). 
 
(<a name="365"><strong>365</strong></a>) 800. Making vows, I shall become a  homeless mendicant and teach the doctrine in a thousand ways; Mahamati  being given assurance and anointed, I shall enter into Nirvana. 
 
801. Mati will hand [the doctrine] over to Dharma and Dharma to  Mekhala; but Mekhala and his disciple being too weak [the doctrine] will  disappear at the end of the Kalpa. 
 
802. Kasyapa, Krakucchanda, and Kanaka, who are the removers, and I,  Viraja, and others—these Buddhas all belong to the golden age. 
 
803. After the golden age there will appear a leader by the name of  Mati, who is a great hero (<em>mahavira</em>) well acquainted with the  five forms of knowledge. 
 
804. Not in the age of two, not in the age of triads, not in the age  of vice, which will come after, but in the golden age world-teachers  will appear, and attain Buddhahood. 
 
805. Without removing the marks, without cutting it into tens,_1_ have the upper garment patched with spots like the eyes in the tail of a  peacock. 
 
806. Let the space between the eyes be two or three fingers apart; if  the patches are otherwise distributed it will excite in the ignorant a  desire to possess. 
 
_1_ Is this right? 
 
807. Let the Yogin always keep the fire of greed under control, be  bathed in the water of knowledge, and practise the triple refuge, and  exert himself diligently throughout the three periods. 
 
(<a name="366"><strong>366</strong></a>) 808. When an arrow, or a stone, or a  piece of wood, is sent forth by means of a bow or sling, one hits and  another falls; so it is with good and bad. 
 
809. The one cannot be the many, for then nowhere would diversities  be seen. Let all receivers be like the wind, and donors be like the  land. 
 
810. If the one were the many, all would be without a causal agency;  this is the destruction of a causal agency, which is the teaching of the  theorisers. 
 
811. [Their teaching] will be like a lamp, like a seed, because of  similitude; but where are the many? If the one becomes the many, this is  the teaching of the theorisers. 
 
812. From sesame no beans grow, rice is not the cause of barley,  wheat does not produce corn; how can the one be the many? 
 
813. There will be Panini, author of the Sabdanetri, Akshapada,  Vrihaspati; Pranetri the Lokayata will be found in Brahma-garbha. 
 
814. Katyayana will be the author of a sutra, and Yajnavalka will be  like him; Bhudhuka will write astronomical works; they will appear in  the age of vice. 
 
(<a name="367"><strong>367</strong></a>) 815. Balin will appear to promote the  welfare of the world, the happiness of mankind, he will be the protector  of all that is good; Balin the king will be a great ruler. 
 
816. Valmika, Masuraksha, Kautilya, and Asvalayana, who are highly  virtuous Rishis, will appear in the future. 
 
817. Siddhartha of the Sakya family, Bhutanta, Pancacudaka,  Vagbaliratha, Medhavin will appear in the times that follow. 
 
818. When I take my abode in the forest-ground, Brahma, chief of the  gods, will give me the hairy skin of a deer, a staff made of wood, a  girdle, and a discus. 
 
819. The great Yogin will be called Viraja the Muni, the teacher and  pointer of emancipation; he is the badge of all the Munis. 
 
820. Brahma with his retinues and many gods will give me an  antelope's skin from the sky, and then the ruler will vanish. 
 
821. When I am in the forest-ground, Indra and Virudhaka and others,  accompanied by the celestial beings, will give me most exquisite  garments and a begging bowl. 
 
(<a name="368"><strong>368</strong></a>) 822. Seeking for a cause in the  doctrine of no-birth, [one may say that] that which is unborn is born,  too, [and imagine that] the no-birth [theory] is [thereby] established;  but this is done in words only. 
 
823-828. (Chapter VI, verses 12-17.)_1_ 
 
829. That the mind is set in motion by ignorance which has been  accumulated by thought since beginningless past, that it is bound to  birth and destruction—this is the imagination of the theorisers. 
 
830. The Samkhya philosophy is twofold. There is transformation owing  to primary matter; (<a name="369"><strong>369</strong></a>) in primary matter  there is action, and action is self-originating. 
 
831. Primary matter is with all existing beings, and qualities are  regarded as differentiated, various are effects and causes, no  transformation takes place. 
 
832. As quicksilver is pure and not soiled by dirt, so is the Alaya  pure, being the seat of all sentient beings. 
 
833. The onion-odour of onion, the womb of a pregnant woman, the  saltiness of salt, etc. —does not [each] evolve like the seed? 
 
834. Otherness is not otherness, so is bothness not bothness; to be  is not to be attached to, there is neither non-being nor the Samskrita. 
 
835. [To say that] an ego is found in the Skandhas is like saying  that the horse-nature is in the cow-nature, which has nothing to do with  it; we may speak of the Samskrita and the Asamskrita, but there is no  self-nature. 
 
_1_ It is noteworthy that the repetitions grow less as we  approach the end and that the subjects referred to are less congruous  with those of the text. The Sagathakam may be an independent collection. 
 
836. Defiled by logic, by the traditional teachings (<em>agama</em>),_1_ by wrong views, by speculation, they are not able to ascertain  definitely about the ego, which they say is; but it does not exist in  any way other than clinging. 
 
837. It is certainly their mistake to think that the ego is  perceivable along with the Skandhas by reason of oneness and otherness;  the theorisers are not enlightened. 
 
838. As an image is seen in a mirror, in water, or in an eye, (<a name="370"><strong>370</strong></a>) so is the soul in the Skandhas devoid of  oneness and otherness. 
 
839. Let it be known that those who reflect and practise meditation  can be released from the evil theories by training themselves in the  three things: the path (<em>marga</em>), the truth (<em>satya</em>), and the  insight (<em>darsana</em>). 
 
840. As a flash of lightning is seen and unseen as the sun passes  through a slit of a door, so is the transformation of all things; it is  not as it is imagined by the ignorant. 
 
841. Being confused in mind the ignorant view Nirvana as the  disappearance of the existent; but since the wise see into reality (<em>sadbhava</em>)  as it abides in itself, they have a truer insight. 
 
842. Transformation [which is the actual state of existence] is to be  ascertained as removed from birth and destruction, devoid of existence  and non-existence, released from qualified and qualifying. 
 
843. Transformation is to be ascertained as having nothing to do with  the philosophical doctrines, with names and forms, and giving an abode_2_ to views of an inner ego. 
 
844. With the [pleasant] touches of the gods and the harassings of  the hells, if it were not for the middle existence, no Vijnanas would  ever evolve._3_ 
 
845. It should be known that the womb-born, the egg-born, the  moisture-born, and other various bodies of sentient beings are born of  the middle existence and descend into the [six] paths of existence. 
 
_1_ After T'ang. 
 
_2_ "Destroying", according to T'ang. 
 
_3_ Read after T'ang. 
 
846. To say that the passions are quieted and destroyed apart from  right reasoning and scriptural teaching, (<a name="371"><strong>371</strong></a>)  is the view and discourse of the philosophers, which is not to be  practised by the intelligent. 
 
847. One should first examine into the nature of an ego-soul and keep  oneself away from attachment; to try to go beyond without an  examination is of no more worth than a barren-woman's child. 
 
848. I observe with a divine eye which is of transcendental wisdom  and is removed from the flesh, [with this I observe] sentient beings,  the physical bodies of all living creatures as devoid of the Samskara  and Skandhas._1_ 
 
849. It is seen that [beings] are distinguished as ugly-coloured and  beautifully-coloured, as emancipated and un-emancipated, as heavenly and  free from the Samskara, and as abiding with the Samskara. 
 
850. I have the body that goes about in the [six] paths of existence;  this does not belong to the realm of the theorisers; it goes beyond the  human world and is not the possession of the theorisers. 
 
851. The ego-soul is not, and the mind is born; how does this  evolving come about? Is it not said that its appearing is like a river, a  lamp, and a seed? 
 
852. The Vijnana not being born there is no ignorance; ignorance  being absent, there is no Vijnana, and how can succession take place? 
 
853. The three divisions of time and no-time, and the fifth is beyond  description; this is what is known to the Buddhas [only, though]  mentioned by the theorisers. 
 
(<a name="372"><strong>372</strong></a>) 854. Knowledge that is the cause of  the Samskara is not to be described by the Samskara; knowledge that is  known as the Samskara seizes the Samskara-path._2_ 
 
855. That being so, this is; causal conditions [everywhere] but no  causes; because of this absence there are no causal agencies; they are  [only] symbolically pointed out. 
 
_1_ Read after T'ang. 
 
_2_ Is this the right reading? 
 
856. The wind, indeed, makes fire burn, but it only incites and does  not produce; further, incited by it the fire goes out; how can [the ego  of] a sentient being be established? 
 
857. The Samskrita and the Asamskrita are spoken of as devoid of  attachment; how is fire imagined by the ignorant for the establishment  [of their ego]? 
 
858. Fire comes to exist in this world supported by the strength of  mutuality; if it is imagined to be like fire, whence is the rising of a  sentient being [i. e. an ego-soul]? 
 
859. By reason of the Manas, etc., there is the accumulation of the  Skandhas and Ayatanas; non-ego like a wealthy merchant moves on with  mentation (<em>citta</em>). 
 
860. These two like the sun are always removed from effect and cause;  fire does not establish them, and the theorisers fail to understand. 
 
861. The mind, sentient beings, and Nirvana—these are primarily pure,  but defiled by faults of the beginningless past; they are not  differentiated, they are like space. 
 
(<a name="373"><strong>373</strong></a>) 862. Defiled by the bad theories of  the philosophers, Hastisayya, etc., are wrapped end enveloped with [the  false discriminations of] the Manovijnana, they imagine fire, etc., are  purifying. 
 
863 Those who see [reality] as it is in itself will see their  passions burst asunder; leaving the forest of bad analogies behind, they  reach the realm of the wise. 
 
864. Thus [reality] is imagined to be something other than itself by  the differentiation of knower and known; the dull-witted do not  understand it, and what is beyond description is talked about. 
 
865. As the ignorant make a sandal-wood drum by taking something else  which appears like sandal-wood and aloe wood, so is [true] knowledge  [to be distinguished] from that of the theorisers. 
 
866. Having eaten he will rise holding the bowl empty; he will have  his mouth well cleansed of offensive and injurious matter; he is to  conduct himself thus towards food. 
 
867. He who reflects rationally on this truth will attain serenity of  mind, accomplish the most excellent discipline, and be above  imagination; he will be released from attachment and realise the highest  meaning; and thus he will light up the golden path of the Dharma. 
 
868. When he who is possessed of stupidity and imagination rising  from his views of being and non-being is freed from the net of bad  theories tainted thereby, and from greed, vice, and anger, he is washed  of the pigment and besprinkled by the Buddhas [with their own] hands. 
 
869. Some philosophers are confused about the direction [of truth]  because of their theory of causation; others are perturbed over  conditions of causality; (<a name="374"><strong>374</strong></a>) others who are  not wise abide in nihilism because of their negation of causation and  reality. 
 
870. There are transformations maturing from [the activities of] the  Manas and the Vijnanas; the Manas is born of the Alaya, and the Vijnana  comes from the Manas. 
 
871. From the Alaya all mental activities take their rise like the  waves; with habit-energy as cause all things are born in accordance with  conditions of causation. 
 
872. [All things] momentarily divided but bound up in a continuous  chain, are taken hold of as real while they are of Mind itself; they  appear in varieties of forms and characters, but are the product of  Manas and the eye-Vijnana, etc. 
 
873. Bound up by the faults [of speculation] since beginningless  past, there is the growth of habit-energy which gives rise to something  like an external world; it is Mind which is seen as manifoldness when it  is hindered by wrong philosophical theories. 
 
874. With that as cause and with that other as condition, [the  Vijnana system] is evolved; when these philosophical views are born,  transformations take place. 
 
875. All things are like Maya and a dream and the Gandharvas' city;  they appear as a mirage, as a lunar reflection in water; be it known  that it is all due to self-discrimination. 
 
876. From the splitting-up of moral conduct, there is suchness and  the right knowledge dependent on it; such Samadhis of superior grade as  the Maya-like, the Surangama, etc. [are attained]. 
 
877. By entering into the [various] stages, the psychic powers, and  the self-masteries, the knowledge of the Maya-likeness of existence and  the [will-]body [are obtained], and there is anointment by the Buddhas. 
 
(<a name="375"><strong>375</strong></a>) 878. When the world is seen as  quiescent, the mind ceases and the [first] stage of Joy is attained, and  [finally] they will reach Buddhahood. 
 
879. A revulsion taking place at the seat [of consciousness, a man  becomes] like a multicoloured gem; he performs deeds [of beneficence]  for sentient beings in the same way as the moon reflects itself in  water. 
 
880. When the dualism of being and non-being is abandoned, there is  neither bothness nor not-bothness; and going beyond Sravakahood and  Pratyekabuddhahood, one will even pass over the seventh stage. 
 
881. [As he goes up through the stages] his insight into the truth of  self-realisation will be purified at every stage, and releasing himself  from externality as well as from the philosophers, he will discourse on  the Mahayana. 
 
882. When there is a revulsion (<em>paravritti</em>) from  discrimination, one is removed from death and destruction; let him  discourse on the truth of the emancipated ones, which is like a hare's  horns,_1_ and a [multicoloured] gem. 
 
883. As the text [is completed] by reason, so is reason [revealed] by  the text; therefore, let there be reason [and the text]; let there be  no other discrimination than reason._2_ 
 
_1_ After Wei and T'ang. The text has "hare's hair" which in  this connection yields no sense. The truth of emptiness may be in a  manner compared to a hare's horns and not to its hair. 
 
_2_ This is the reading of T'ang. By "text" (教, <em>grantha</em>) is meant any literary production  in which a principle or reason, 理, (<em>yukti</em>)  is expounded. <em>Grantha</em> is here contrasted to <em>yukti</em> as <em>desana</em> or <em>desana-patha</em> is to <em>siddhanta</em> or <em>pratyatmagati</em>,  or as <em>ruta</em> is to <em>artha</em>. This contrasting the letter to  spirit or meaning has been one of the main topics of the <em>Lankavatara</em>.  Wei has 結 for <em>grantha</em> and 相應 for <em>yukti</em>, which does not yield any sense  in this connection. The two versions, Wei and T'ang, are quoted in full: 
 
Wei—如依結相應. 依法亦如是. 依相應相應. 莫分別於異. 
 
T'ang—教由理故成. 理由教故顯. 當依此教理. 勿更餘分別. 
 
884. Such are the eye, karma, desire, ignorance, and the Yogins; such  is the Manas in relation to the eye[-consciousness] and form, such is  the Manas in relation to the defiled._1_

_1_ This is missing in T'ang. Wei further adds: "When the  Buddha preached this exquisite Sutra, the Holy Mahamati the  Bodhisattva-Mahasattva, Ravana the King, Suka, Sarana, Kumbakarna, and  other Rakshasas, the Devas, the Nagas, the Yakshas, the Gandharvas, the  Asuras, the gods, the Bhikshus were all delighted and accepted [the  teaching]." This addition shows that Wei as a whole may be a much later  production even than T'ang, for such a passage is ordinarily regarded as  the regular conclusion for a sutra; and when this was found missing in  the earlier copy of the <em>Lankavatara,</em> the writer of the Wei  original added it to complete the form.
