I'm Al Tesshin (徹真) Billings.

I'm a professional technology worker in the Bay Area of California.

I've been on the Internet since back in 1989 when we had to hack into a local dial-up at the University and work out from there through telnet via intermediate university unix boxes. I once ran a UUCP node, pagan.UUCP, back in the golden days, in order to get Usenet and e-mail. I ran two different Seattle area modem-based bulletin board systems in the late 80's and early 90's: **Revelstone** and **The Sacred Grove**.

I also have an interdisciplinary Master of Art's in Humanities from California State University, Dominguez Hills. My concentration was Philosophy, specifically in the space of Philosophy of Religion. My thesis focused on the late 19th century "Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn" and its beliefs and teachings concerning the nature and structure of the human soul. You can download the entire PDF of my thesis or preview 24 pages of it online at the [ProQuest page](http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1472152931&Fmt=2&clientId%20=79356&RQT=309&VName=PQD) for it.

I am also the former president and a former board member of [Ace Monster Toys](http://acemonstertoys.org), a [hackerspace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) established in 2010 in Oakland, California. We are a California non-profit organization with a pending federal 501(c)(3) application. I served as the president from January, 2011 to June, 2012 and was on the first two boards, from June, 2010 through June, 2012. When not engaged in various Buddhist things or my work, much of my time is spent focusing on Ace Monster Toys during the week.
