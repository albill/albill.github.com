My way of giving back to the Paper community is by putting my drawings, sketches, and tutorials up on Mix. I feel that the best way to grow is by examining other's work in detail to learn from it.

The idea that someone is going to download my work from Mix and deface it or pass it off as their own doesn't really bother me. Paper and Mix are fun diversions for me and I try not to take it as serious as some may.

If you haven't yet discovered FiftyThree's Mix yet, I wrote up a [crash course on the service]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-11-25-mix %}) and how I like to use it.
