Writing a book devoted to Paper by FiftyThree would be awesome. Once I finish the next couple of tutorials I want to look into creating an eBook version or possibly a printed version.

I would love to print Moleskine books of the guides using Paper's built-in book feature, but I don't think that will be cost effective. At $50+ a pop that doesn't exactly scream *affordable*.

In the meantime you're welcome to [follow me on Mix](https://mix.fiftythree.com/11098-Michael-Rose) where I often share *one-page* cheat sheets and mini-guides. The cool thing is you can download these pages directly to your Paper journals to reference or manipulate.
