The first iPad stylus I purchased was a [Just-Mobile AluPen][alupen-stylus] and used it for quite some time before the rubber tip wore out. The AluPen's tip isn't replaceable so I ended up using a [LunaTik Alloy Touch Pen][lunatik-stylus] next.

I like the Touch Pen because it's built to last. The tip isn't a squishy rubber nib like many others and is super durable. I've drawn close to 400 portraits with it and it works just as flawless as the day I got it. I'd still be using it if I hadn't been lured over to the dark-side of Bluetooth styli.

Speaking of Bluetooth styli, I now use a [FiftyThree's Pencil][pencil-stylus] about 99% of the time to take advantage of Surface Pressure and to activate the Blend feature when I want to create reflections and other blur effects. Before I upgraded to an iPad Air 2 I was all about the [Pogo Connect Smart Pen][pogo-stylus], but sadly it does not work well with the newer iPads' digitizers.

| Stylus | My Quick Impressions
|---
| [*Just-Mobile AluPen*][alupen-stylus] | Lasted me a few months before wearing out. Tips aren't replaceable.
| [*LunaTik Alloy Touch Pen*][lunatik-stylus] | My trusted sidekick for a long long time. Tip took some serious abuse.
| [*Ten One Design Pogo Connect*][pogo-stylus] | Most of my drawings are done with a Pogo Connect now. Two broke due to bad hardware design. Wore through about four R2 tips. Connectivity issues are maddening.
| [*Pencil by FiftyThree*][pencil-stylus] | Super reliable when I'm not wearing out tips in a few days. Flirting with it again after recent Paper update that scales tools when zoomed in.
| [*ZEN 3 in 1*][zen-stylus] | Precision disc tip dead on arrival. Rubber nib still going strong.
| [*Universal Touch Screen Pen*][cheap-stylus] | Cheap, small, light, and pretty crappy. Comes in a 3 pack that I have as a backup if I ever lose my other styli.
