I'm Al Tesshin (徹真) Billings. I moved most actitivies to "[Make Hack Learn](http://makehacklearn.org)" where I post the more technological and geek oriented stuff (computers, electronics, hacking, science fiction), leaving this site largely for Buddhist related topics.

I'm a professional technology worker in the Bay Area of California. My employer is [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.com). The Mozilla Community is the proud creator of the Firefox web browser, along with many other projects, as guided by the [Mozilla Manifesto](http://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto.html). I work as a program manager on the Platform Security team and manage our team of [fuzzing engineers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing) there.

Previously, I worked as a Quality Assurance Lead at Mozilla focusing on security releases. I also worked at Microsoft for nine years doing QA work and some customer facing work with feedback and blogs as a project manager on the Internet Explorer team. All of my professional experience in technology has been in the space of the Internet focusing on web browsers as well as web communities. I worked on Internet Explorer versions 4 through 7 (with a stint working on MSN Explorer) as well as every version of Firefox from 3.0 through to the present.

I've been on the Internet since back in 1989 when we had to hack into a local dial-up at the University and work out from there through telnet via intermediate university unix boxes. I once ran a UUCP node, pagan.UUCP, back in the golden days, in order to get Usenet and e-mail. I ran two different Seattle area modem-based bulletin board systems in the late 80's and early 90's: **Revelstone** and **The Sacred Grove**.

I also have an interdisciplinary Master of Art's in Humanities from California State University, Dominguez Hills. My concentration was Philosophy, specifically in the space of Philosophy of Religion. My thesis focused on the late 19th century "Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn" and its beliefs and teachings concerning the nature and structure of the human soul. You can download the entire PDF of my thesis or preview 24 pages of it online at the [ProQuest page](http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1472152931&Fmt=2&clientId%20=79356&RQT=309&VName=PQD) for it.

I am also the former president and a former board member of [Ace Monster Toys](http://acemonstertoys.org), a [hackerspace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) established in 2010 in Oakland, California. We are a California non-profit organization with a pending federal 501(c)(3) application. I served as the president from January, 2011 to June, 2012 and was on the first two boards, from June, 2010 through June, 2012. When not engaged in various Buddhist things or my work, much of my time is spent focusing on Ace Monster Toys during the week.

If you need to contact me, e-mail me through 'albill' at this domain. (<em>Be warned, I get a lot of e-mail and may not respond to unsolicited contacts.</em>)
